      "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus. From the given information, x is defined as mabtpus and fekcpus. But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\n\nThe question is: Is x babgpus and babkpus and babmpus? Since x is given as mabtpus and fekcpus, I need to find connections from mabtpus or fekcpus to babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus.\n\nLet me list out what I know about these bab categories.\n\nStarting with babgpus: From the information, lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus. And yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus. Also, bajlpus is yexbpus. But I need to see if x is connected to babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, babkpus: qoslpus is babkpus and cugjpus. And wonvpus is qoslpus and qoxypus. But wonvpus is also jowxpus, and jowxpus is nucxpus, etc.\n\nbabmpus: nucxpus is babmpus and qomrpus. And nucxpus is also kufbpus, but from banspus, which is part of vuwtpus, etc.\n\nNow, x is mabtpus and fekcpus. I need to find what mabtpus is. From the information: mabtpus is davhpus. And davhpus is yewzpus. yewzpus is ketgpus. ketgpus is mihzpus. mihzpus is tewzpus and woghpus. tewzpus is modtpus. modtpus is mubgpus. mubgpus is kidypus and wajcpus. kidypus is kilqpus and tikzpus. kilqpus is mefypus and qemxpus. mefypus is rapbpus. rapbpus is tehnpus and gufypus. tehnpus is zedzpus. zedzpus is zorgpus and hevjpus. zorgpus is cidgpus. cidgpus is hovjpus. hovjpus is quzppus. quzppus is zaxjpus and kanppus. zaxjpus is qetnpus. qetnpus is tisnpus and puzlpus. tisnpus is cimypus. cimypus is meqbpus. meqbpus is yoljpus. yoljpus is falfpus. falfpus is beblpus. beblpus is mebypus. mebypus is gomrpus. gomrpus is gurhpus. gurhpus is miybpus. miybpus is quzbpus. quzbpus is nubspus. nubspus is bonzpus. bonzpus is lafvpus. lafvpus is pujcpus and zifjpus. pujcpus is lunvpus. lunvpus is jupgpus and dewcpus. jupgpus is guzgpus and pobgpus. guzgpus is ruvbpus. ruvbpus is damlpus and lefspus. damlpus is fidvpus and legrpus and balkpus. fidvpus is vuwtpus. vuwtpus is banspus. banspus is miqgpus and sodjpus and jipgpus and ruggpus. miqgpus is koljpus. koljpus is gikppus. gikppus is munqpus. munqpus is gunfpus and pidtpus. gunfpus is gedbpus. gedbpus is leccpus. leccpus is pultpus. pultpus is yiqcpus. yiqcpus is sirspus. sirspus is qondpus. qondpus is joqtpus and doyypus. joqtpus is xigmpus and soybpus. xigmpus is kikmpus and riglpus. kikmpus is vadbpus. vadbpus is xoxjpus and kimnpus. etc. This seems very long and complicated. I might be going down a rabbit hole.\n\nI recall that x is also fekcpus, but I don't see fekcpus in the given information. Let me check the list: \"x is mabtpus and fekcpus.\" But in the information, I don't see fekcpus defined anywhere. Let me scan the entire text: **Given Information**: jewcpus is qongpus. ... and so on. I don't see \"fekcpus\" mentioned anywhere else. So perhaps fekcpus is not defined, but since x is said to be fekcpus, it might be a category itself, but I need to see if it connects to babgpus etc.\n\nMaybe I need to find if mabtpus is connected to babgpus.\n\nFrom above, mabtpus leads to davhpus, which leads to yewzpus, which leads to ketgpus, etc. But I need to see if any of these lead to babgpus.\n\nbabgpus is mentioned in lerwpus: lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus. And lerwpus is also part of yexbpus: yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus. And yexbpus is bajlpus: bajlpus is yexbpus. And zorvpus is bajlpus: zorvpus is bajlpus? From the information: zorvpus is zibxpus. Wait, no: \"zorvpus is zibxpus\" but earlier \"bajlpus is yexbpus\" and \"zorvpus is bajlpus\"? Let's see: \"bajlpus is yexbpus\" and then \"zorvpus is zibxpus\" but later \"zorvpus is bajlpus\"? No, from the information: \"zorvpus is zibxpus\" and then \"bajlpus is yexbpus\" so zorvpus is not directly related to bajlpus.\n\nBut from \"lerwpus is babgpus\" and lerwpus is also under yexbpus, but I need to see if mabtpus connects to lerwpus.\n\nFrom the chain, mabtpus -> davhpus -> yewzpus -> ketgpus -> mihzpus -> tewzpus -> modtpus -> mubgpus -> kidypus -> kilqpus -> mefypus -> rapbpus -> tehnpus -> zedzpus -> zorgpus -> cidgpus -> hovjpus -> quzppus -> zaxjpus -> qetnpus -> tisnpus -> cimypus -> meqbpus -> yoljpus -> falfpus -> beblpus -> mebypus -> gomrpus -> gurhpus -> miybpus -> quzbpus -> nubspus -> bonzpus -> lafvpus -> pujcpus -> lunvpus -> jupgpus -> guzgpus -> ruvbpus -> damlpus -> fidvpus -> vuwtpus -> banspus -> miqgpus -> koljpus -> gikppus -> munqpus -> gunfpus -> gedbpus -> leccpus -> pultpus -> yiqcpus -> sirspus -> qondpus -> joqtpus -> xigmpus -> kikmpus -> vadbpus -> xoxjpus and kimnpus. This doesn't seem to lead to lerwpus.\n\nPerhaps I missed something. Let's think about babgpus directly. lerwpus is babgpus, and lerwpus is also mentioned in yexbpus: yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus. And yexbpus is bajlpus: bajlpus is yexbpus. But is bajlpus connected to anything else? From zorvpus: but zorvpus is zibxpus, not bajlpus. Wait, there is \"zorvpus is bajlpus\" somewhere? Let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the information: \"bajlpus is yexbpus.\" and then \"zorvpus is zibxpus.\" but later \"zorvpus is bajlpus\" is not stated. Instead, I see \"zorvpus is zibxpus\" and \"bajlpus is yexbpus\" so no direct link.\n\nBut from \"xecypus is zorvpus and hefmpus\" and \"cehxpus is xecypus\" etc., but still not connected to mabtpus.\n\nAnother way: perhaps from fekcpus. But fekcpus is not defined, so it might be a dead end.\n\nNow, for babkpus: qoslpus is babkpus and cugjpus. And wonvpus is qoslpus and qoxypus. wonvpus is also jowxpus: \"wonvpus is jowxpus\" and \"jowxpus is nucxpus\" so wonvpus is nucxpus. And nucxpus is babmpus and qomrpus, so wonvpus is also babmpus indirectly.\n\nBut is x connected to wonvpus? x is mabtpus and fekcpus. From mabtpus, as above, we have a long chain, but does it reach wonvpus? wonvpus is also mentioned in tudcpus: \"tudcpus is wonvpus\" and \"gecvpus is tudcpus\" and \"dubnpus is gecvpus and sirtpus\" and \"titdpus is dubnpus and vavkpus\" and \"wamxpus is titdpus\" and \"xegbpus is wamxpus and turwpus\" and \"lirspus is xegbpus\" and \"getjpus is lirspus and gogqpus\" and \"topjpus is getjpus and poytpus\" and \"topjpus is also under cuqqpus: cuqqpus is topjpus\" and \"hamnpus is cuqqpus and dewwpus\" and \"yubfpus is hamnpus and xikppus and nibmpus\" and \"qongpus is yubfpus\" and \"jewcpus is qongpus\" and \"heyxpus is jewcpus\" and \"geqbpus is heyxpus and nivzpus\" and \"pawrpus is geqbpus and sigjpus\" but pawrpus is also hesvpus: \"hesvpus is pawrpus\" and \"sihnpus is hesvpus and kogppus\" and \"titspus is sihnpus and rijkpus\" and \"foyypus is titspus\" and \"pembpus is foyypus and fubypus and gugppus\" and \"tolhpus is pembpus and yeftpus\" and \"kuzhpus is tolhpus\" etc. This is messy.\n\nPerhaps I need to find if x is directly related to any of these.\n\nSince x is mabtpus, and mabtpus is davhpus, and davhpus is yewzpus, and yewzpus is ketgpus, and ketgpus is mihzpus, and mihzpus is tewzpus and woghpus, and tewzpus is modtpus, and modtpus is mubgpus, and mubgpus is kidypus and wajcpus, and kidypus is kilqpus and tikzpus, and kilqpus is mefypus and qemxpus, and mefypus is rapbpus, and rapbpus is tehnpus and gufypus, and tehnpus is zedzpus, and zedzpus is zorgpus and hevjpus, and zorgpus is cidgpus, and cidgpus is hovjpus, and hovjpus is quzppus, and quzppus is zaxjpus and kanppus, and zaxjpus is qetnpus, and qetnpus is tisnpus and puzlpus, and tisnpus is cimypus, and cimypus is meqbpus, and meqbpus is yoljpus, and yoljpus is falfpus, and falfpus is beblpus, and beblpus is mebypus, and mebypus is gomrpus, and gomrpus is gurhpus, and gurhpus is miybpus, and miybpus is quzbpus, and quzbpus is nubspus, and nubspus is bonzpus, and bonzpus is lafvpus, and lafvpus is pujcpus and zifjpus, and pujcpus is lunvpus, and lunvpus is jupgpus and dewcpus, and jupgpus is guzgpus and pobgpus, and guzgpus is ruvbpus, and ruvbpus is damlpus and lefspus, and damlpus is fidvpus and legrpus and balkpus, and fidvpus is vuwtpus, and vuwtpus is banspus, and banspus is miqgpus and sodjpus and jipgpus and ruggpus, and miqgpus is koljpus, and koljpus is gikppus, and gikppus is munqpus, and munqpus is gunfpus and pidtpus, and gunfpus is gedbpus, and gedbpus is leccpus, and leccpus is pultpus, and pultpus is yiqcpus, and yiqcpus is sirspus, and sirspus is qondpus, and qondpus is joqtpus and doyypus, and joqtpus is xigmpus and soybpus, and xigmpus is kikmpus and riglpus, and kikmpus is vadbpus, and vadbpus is xoxjpus and kimnpus. So from mabtpus, we eventually reach vadbpus, which is xoxjpus and kimnpus, but not directly to wonvpus or babkpus.\n\nNow, wonvpus is jowxpus, and jowxpus is nucxpus, and nucxpus is kufbpus, but also nucxpus is babmpus and qomrpus. So to connect to wonvpus, we need to find from where wonvpus is connected.\n\nwonvpus is also under tudcpus: tudcpus is wonvpus, and gecvpus is tudcpus, and dubnpus is gecvpus and sirtpus, and titdpus is dubnpus and vavkpus, and wamxpus is titdpus, and xegbpus is wamxpus and turwpus, and lirspus is xegbpus, and getjpus is lirspus and gogqpus, and topjpus is getjpus and poytpus, and topjpus is under cuqqpus: cuqqpus is topjpus, and hamnpus is cuqqpus and dewwpus, and yubfpus is hamnpus and xikppus and nibmpus, and qongpus is yubfpus, and jewcpus is qongpus, and heyxpus is jewcpus, and geqbpus is heyxpus and nivzpus, and pawrpus is geqbpus and sigjpus, and hesvpus is pawrpus, and sihnpus is hesvpus and kogppus, and titspus is sihnpus and rijkpus, and foyypus is titspus, and pembpus is foyypus and fubypus and gugppus, and tolhpus is pembpus and yeftpus, and kuzhpus is tolhpus, etc. But this doesn't connect to mabtpus.\n\nFrom mabtpus, we have a chain to vadbpus, but vadbpus is xoxjpus and kimnpus, which might not connect to wonvpus.\n\nPerhaps from fekcpus. But fekcpus is not defined, so it might be that fekcpus is a category that includes babgpus etc., but since it's not defined, we can't say.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps \"x is mabtpus and fekcpus\" means that x belongs to both mabtpus and fekcpus, but fekcpus might be a super category that includes other things, but from the information, we don't know what fekcpus is.\n\nSo for x to be babgpus, it must be that mabtpus or fekcpus is babgpus, but from the information, mabtpus is davhpus, and davhpus is yewzpus, etc., and nowhere in the chain do we see babgpus.\n\nSimilarly for babkpus and babmpus.\n\nbabmpus is nucxpus, and nucxpus is also under banspus: banspus is miqgpus and sodjpus and jipgpus and ruggpus, but from mabtpus, we have vuwtpus which is banspus, so vuwtpus is banspus, and banspus includes miqgpus etc., but nucxpus is not directly in banspus; banspus has miqgpus, sodjpus, etc., but nucxpus is from jowxpus: jowxpus is nucxpus, and wonvpus is jowxpus, but wonvpus is not in banspus. banspus is part of vuwtpus, and vuwtpus is from fidvpus, which is from damlpus, which is from ruvbpus, etc., from earlier chain from mabtpus, we have damlpus, so damlpus is fidvpus and legrpus and balkpus, and fidvpus is vuwtpus, and vuwtpus is banspus, so banspus is included, but banspus is miqgpus and sodjpus and jipgpus and ruggpus, which does not include nucxpus. nucxpus is from elsewhere.\n\nnucxpus is from jowxpus: \"jowxpus is nucxpus\" and \"wonvpus is jowxpus\" so wonvpus is nucxpus, and wonvpus is also under tudcpus: \"tudcpus is wonvpus\" and \"gecvpus is tudcpus\" and \"dubnpus is gecvpus\" etc., but from mabtpus, we don't have dubnpus directly. From mabtpus, we have titdpus is dubnpus and vavkpus, but titdpus is from wamxpus: \"wamxpus is titdpus\" and xegbpus is wamxpus, etc., but from mabtpus, we reached vadbpus, which is xoxjpus and kimnpus, not wamxpus.\n\nFrom the chain of mabtpus, we have from pultpus to yiqcpus to sirspus to qondpus to joqtpus to xigmpus to kikmpus to vadbpus, so vadbpus is reached, but vadbpus is xoxjpus and kimnpus, which is not related to wamxpus.\n\nwamxpus is from xegbpus: \"xegbpus is wamxpus and turwpus\" and \"lirspus is xegbpus\" etc., so different branch.\n\nSo it seems that mabtpus does not lead to wonvpus or nucxpus, so not to babmpus.\n\nSimilarly for babkpus, which is from qoslpus, and qoslpus is from wonvpus: \"wonvpus is qoslpus and qoxypus\" so wonvpus is qoslpus, so same as above, not connected to mabtpus.\n\nFor babgpus, from lerwpus, which is from yexbpus, and yexbpus is from bajlpus, and bajlpus is from zorvpus? But zorvpus is zibxpus, not directly bajlpus. From \"bajlpus is yexbpus\" and \"zorvpus is zibxpus\" but no connection between zorvpus and bajlpus. However, from \"xecypus is zorvpus and hefmpus\" and \"cehxpus is xecypus\" etc., but again, not connected to mabtpus.\n\nFrom another angle, lerwpus is also mentioned in yexbpus, and yexbpus is bajlpus, and bajlpus might be connected elsewhere, but from the information, bajlpus is only defined as yexbpus, so no other connections.\n\nSo, based on the given information, there is no path from mabtpus to babgpus, babkpus, or babmpus.\n\nTherefore, it is not true that x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus.\n\nBut the question is to say true, false, or unknown. Since we have no information linking x to these, it should be false or unknown.\n\nBut in logic, if we cannot prove it, it is unknown, but based on the context, since x is defined as mabtpus and fekcpus, and fekcpus is not defined, it might be that fekcpus includes these, but since no information, we should say unknown.\n\nHowever, from the information, we can see that mabtpus is not these things, so for x to be these, it must be through fekcpus, but since fekcpus is not defined, we don't know, so unknown.\n\nBut let's see if there is any direct statement about x.\n\nx is mentioned only once: \"x is mabtpus and fekcpus.\" So we know x is mabtpus, so if mabtpus is not babgpus, then x is not babgpus, unless fekcpus is babgpus, but we don't know what fekcpus is.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for each of babgpus, babkpus, babmpus, since we don't know what fekcpus is, we cannot say that x is them through fekcpus.\n\nTherefore, it is unknown.\n\nBut let's confirm if mabtpus is any of these. From the chain, mabtpus is davhpus, which is yewzpus, etc., and nowhere does it say that davhpus or yewzpus is babgpus etc., so mabtpus is not babgpus, etc.\n\nSo for x to be babgpus, it must be that fekcpus is babgpus, but since fekcpus is not defined, we don't know.\n\nHence, the statement is unknown.\n\nSo the answer should be unknown.\n\nBut the question is \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" so all three together.\n\nSince we don't know about fekcpus, we cannot say for sure.\n\nTherefore, unknown.",
      "thinking_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus. From the given information, x is defined as mabtpus and fekcpus. But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\n\nThe question is: Is x babgpus and babkpus and babmpus? Since x is given as mabtpus and fekcpus, I need to find connections from mabtpus or fekcpus to babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus.\n\nLet me list out what I know about these bab categories.\n\nStarting with babgpus: From the information, lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus. And yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus. Also, bajlpus is yexbpus. But I need to see if x is connected to babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, babkpus: qoslpus is babkpus and cugjpus. And wonvpus is qoslpus and qoxypus. But wonvpus is also jowxpus, and jowxpus is nucxpus, etc.\n\nbabmpus: nucxpus is babmpus and qomrpus. And nucxpus is also kufbpus, but from banspus, which is part of vuwtpus, etc.\n\nNow, x is mabtpus and fekcpus. I need to find what mabtpus is. From the information: mabtpus is davhpus. And davhpus is yewzpus. yewzpus is ketgpus. ketgpus is mihzpus. mihzpus is tewzpus and woghpus. tewzpus is modtpus. modtpus is mubgpus. mubgpus is kidypus and wajcpus. kidypus is kilqpus and tikzpus. kilqpus is mefypus and qemxpus. mefypus is rapbpus. rapbpus is tehnpus and gufypus. tehnpus is zedzpus. zedzpus is zorgpus and hevjpus. zorgpus is cidgpus. cidgpus is hovjpus. hovjpus is quzppus. quzppus is zaxjpus and kanppus. zaxjpus is qetnpus. qetnpus is tisnpus and puzlpus. tisnpus is cimypus. cimypus is meqbpus. meqbpus is yoljpus. yoljpus is falfpus. falfpus is beblpus. beblpus is mebypus. mebypus is gomrpus. gomrpus is gurhpus. gurhpus is miybpus. miybpus is quzbpus. quzbpus is nubspus. nubspus is bonzpus. bonzpus is lafvpus. lafvpus is pujcpus and zifjpus. pujcpus is lunvpus. lunvpus is jupgpus and dewcpus. jupgpus is guzgpus and pobgpus. guzgpus is ruvbpus. ruvbpus is damlpus and lefspus. damlpus is fidvpus and legrpus and balkpus. fidvpus is vuwtpus. vuwtpus is banspus. banspus is miqgpus and sodjpus and jipgpus and ruggpus. miqgpus is koljpus. koljpus is gikppus. gikppus is munqpus. munqpus is gunfpus and pidtpus. gunfpus is gedbpus. gedbpus is leccpus. leccpus is pultpus. pultpus is yiqcpus. yiqcpus is sirspus. sirspus is qondpus. qondpus is joqtpus and doyypus. joqtpus is xigmpus and soybpus. xigmpus is kikmpus and riglpus. kikmpus is vadbpus. vadbpus is xoxjpus and kimnpus. etc. This seems very long and complicated. I might be going down a rabbit hole.\n\nI recall that x is also fekcpus, but I don't see fekcpus in the given information. Let me check the list: \"x is mabtpus and fekcpus.\" But in the information, I don't see fekcpus defined anywhere. Let me scan the entire text: **Given Information**: jewcpus is qongpus. ... and so on. I don't see \"fekcpus\" mentioned anywhere else. So perhaps fekcpus is not defined, but since x is said to be fekcpus, it might be a category itself, but I need to see if it connects to babgpus etc.\n\nMaybe I need to find if mabtpus is connected to babgpus.\n\nFrom above, mabtpus leads to davhpus, which leads to yewzpus, which leads to ketgpus, etc. But I need to see if any of these lead to babgpus.\n\nbabgpus is mentioned in lerwpus: lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus. And lerwpus is also part of yexbpus: yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus. And yexbpus is bajlpus: bajlpus is yexbpus. And zorvpus is bajlpus: zorvpus is bajlpus? From the information: zorvpus is zibxpus. Wait, no: \"zorvpus is zibxpus\" but earlier \"bajlpus is yexbpus\" and \"zorvpus is bajlpus\"? Let's see: \"bajlpus is yexbpus\" and then \"zorvpus is zibxpus\" but later \"zorvpus is bajlpus\"? No, from the information: \"zorvpus is zibxpus\" and then \"bajlpus is yexbpus\" so zorvpus is not directly related to bajlpus.\n\nBut from \"lerwpus is babgpus\" and lerwpus is also under yexbpus, but I need to see if mabtpus connects to lerwpus.\n\nFrom the chain, mabtpus -> davhpus -> yewzpus -> ketgpus -> mihzpus -> tewzpus -> modtpus -> mubgpus -> kidypus -> kilqpus -> mefypus -> rapbpus -> tehnpus -> zedzpus -> zorgpus -> cidgpus -> hovjpus -> quzppus -> zaxjpus -> qetnpus -> tisnpus -> cimypus -> meqbpus -> yoljpus -> falfpus -> beblpus -> mebypus -> gomrpus -> gurhpus -> miybpus -> quzbpus -> nubspus -> bonzpus -> lafvpus -> pujcpus -> lunvpus -> jupgpus -> guzgpus -> ruvbpus -> damlpus -> fidvpus -> vuwtpus -> banspus -> miqgpus -> koljpus -> gikppus -> munqpus -> gunfpus -> gedbpus -> leccpus -> pultpus -> yiqcpus -> sirspus -> qondpus -> joqtpus -> xigmpus -> kikmpus -> vadbpus -> xoxjpus and kimnpus. This doesn't seem to lead to lerwpus.\n\nPerhaps I missed something. Let's think about babgpus directly. lerwpus is babgpus, and lerwpus is also mentioned in yexbpus: yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus. And yexbpus is bajlpus: bajlpus is yexbpus. But is bajlpus connected to anything else? From zorvpus: but zorvpus is zibxpus, not bajlpus. Wait, there is \"zorvpus is bajlpus\" somewhere? Let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the information: \"bajlpus is yexbpus.\" and then \"zorvpus is zibxpus.\" but later \"zorvpus is bajlpus\" is not stated. Instead, I see \"zorvpus is zibxpus\" and \"bajlpus is yexbpus\" so no direct link.\n\nBut from \"xecypus is zorvpus and hefmpus\" and \"cehxpus is xecypus\" etc., but still not connected to mabtpus.\n\nAnother way: perhaps from fekcpus. But fekcpus is not defined, so it might be a dead end.\n\nNow, for babkpus: qoslpus is babkpus and cugjpus. And wonvpus is qoslpus and qoxypus. wonvpus is also jowxpus: \"wonvpus is jowxpus\" and \"jowxpus is nucxpus\" so wonvpus is nucxpus. And nucxpus is babmpus and qomrpus, so wonvpus is also babmpus indirectly.\n\nBut is x connected to wonvpus? x is mabtpus and fekcpus. From mabtpus, as above, we have a long chain, but does it reach wonvpus? wonvpus is also mentioned in tudcpus: \"tudcpus is wonvpus\" and \"gecvpus is tudcpus\" and \"dubnpus is gecvpus and sirtpus\" and \"titdpus is dubnpus and vavkpus\" and \"wamxpus is titdpus\" and \"xegbpus is wamxpus and turwpus\" and \"lirspus is xegbpus\" and \"getjpus is lirspus and gogqpus\" and \"topjpus is getjpus and poytpus\" and \"topjpus is also under cuqqpus: cuqqpus is topjpus\" and \"hamnpus is cuqqpus and dewwpus\" and \"yubfpus is hamnpus and xikppus and nibmpus\" and \"qongpus is yubfpus\" and \"jewcpus is qongpus\" and \"heyxpus is jewcpus\" and \"geqbpus is heyxpus and nivzpus\" and \"pawrpus is geqbpus and sigjpus\" but pawrpus is also hesvpus: \"hesvpus is pawrpus\" and \"sihnpus is hesvpus and kogppus\" and \"titspus is sihnpus and rijkpus\" and \"foyypus is titspus\" and \"pembpus is foyypus and fubypus and gugppus\" and \"tolhpus is pembpus and yeftpus\" and \"kuzhpus is tolhpus\" etc. This is messy.\n\nPerhaps I need to find if x is directly related to any of these.\n\nSince x is mabtpus, and mabtpus is davhpus, and davhpus is yewzpus, and yewzpus is ketgpus, and ketgpus is mihzpus, and mihzpus is tewzpus and woghpus, and tewzpus is modtpus, and modtpus is mubgpus, and mubgpus is kidypus and wajcpus, and kidypus is kilqpus and tikzpus, and kilqpus is mefypus and qemxpus, and mefypus is rapbpus, and rapbpus is tehnpus and gufypus, and tehnpus is zedzpus, and zedzpus is zorgpus and hevjpus, and zorgpus is cidgpus, and cidgpus is hovjpus, and hovjpus is quzppus, and quzppus is zaxjpus and kanppus, and zaxjpus is qetnpus, and qetnpus is tisnpus and puzlpus, and tisnpus is cimypus, and cimypus is meqbpus, and meqbpus is yoljpus, and yoljpus is falfpus, and falfpus is beblpus, and beblpus is mebypus, and mebypus is gomrpus, and gomrpus is gurhpus, and gurhpus is miybpus, and miybpus is quzbpus, and quzbpus is nubspus, and nubspus is bonzpus, and bonzpus is lafvpus, and lafvpus is pujcpus and zifjpus, and pujcpus is lunvpus, and lunvpus is jupgpus and dewcpus, and jupgpus is guzgpus and pobgpus, and guzgpus is ruvbpus, and ruvbpus is damlpus and lefspus, and damlpus is fidvpus and legrpus and balkpus, and fidvpus is vuwtpus, and vuwtpus is banspus, and banspus is miqgpus and sodjpus and jipgpus and ruggpus, and miqgpus is koljpus, and koljpus is gikppus, and gikppus is munqpus, and munqpus is gunfpus and pidtpus, and gunfpus is gedbpus, and gedbpus is leccpus, and leccpus is pultpus, and pultpus is yiqcpus, and yiqcpus is sirspus, and sirspus is qondpus, and qondpus is joqtpus and doyypus, and joqtpus is xigmpus and soybpus, and xigmpus is kikmpus and riglpus, and kikmpus is vadbpus, and vadbpus is xoxjpus and kimnpus. So from mabtpus, we eventually reach vadbpus, which is xoxjpus and kimnpus, but not directly to wonvpus or babkpus.\n\nNow, wonvpus is jowxpus, and jowxpus is nucxpus, and nucxpus is kufbpus, but also nucxpus is babmpus and qomrpus. So to connect to wonvpus, we need to find from where wonvpus is connected.\n\nwonvpus is also under tudcpus: tudcpus is wonvpus, and gecvpus is tudcpus, and dubnpus is gecvpus and sirtpus, and titdpus is dubnpus and vavkpus, and wamxpus is titdpus, and xegbpus is wamxpus and turwpus, and lirspus is xegbpus, and getjpus is lirspus and gogqpus, and topjpus is getjpus and poytpus, and topjpus is under cuqqpus: cuqqpus is topjpus, and hamnpus is cuqqpus and dewwpus, and yubfpus is hamnpus and xikppus and nibmpus, and qongpus is yubfpus, and jewcpus is qongpus, and heyxpus is jewcpus, and geqbpus is heyxpus and nivzpus, and pawrpus is geqbpus and sigjpus, and hesvpus is pawrpus, and sihnpus is hesvpus and kogppus, and titspus is sihnpus and rijkpus, and foyypus is titspus, and pembpus is foyypus and fubypus and gugppus, and tolhpus is pembpus and yeftpus, and kuzhpus is tolhpus, etc. But this doesn't connect to mabtpus.\n\nFrom mabtpus, we have a chain to vadbpus, but vadbpus is xoxjpus and kimnpus, which might not connect to wonvpus.\n\nPerhaps from fekcpus. But fekcpus is not defined, so it might be that fekcpus is a category that includes babgpus etc., but since it's not defined, we can't say.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps \"x is mabtpus and fekcpus\" means that x belongs to both mabtpus and fekcpus, but fekcpus might be a super category that includes other things, but from the information, we don't know what fekcpus is.\n\nSo for x to be babgpus, it must be that mabtpus or fekcpus is babgpus, but from the information, mabtpus is davhpus, and davhpus is yewzpus, etc., and nowhere in the chain do we see babgpus.\n\nSimilarly for babkpus and babmpus.\n\nbabmpus is nucxpus, and nucxpus is also under banspus: banspus is miqgpus and sodjpus and jipgpus and ruggpus, but from mabtpus, we have vuwtpus which is banspus, so vuwtpus is banspus, and banspus includes miqgpus etc., but nucxpus is not directly in banspus; banspus has miqgpus, sodjpus, etc., but nucxpus is from jowxpus: jowxpus is nucxpus, and wonvpus is jowxpus, but wonvpus is not in banspus. banspus is part of vuwtpus, and vuwtpus is from fidvpus, which is from damlpus, which is from ruvbpus, etc., from earlier chain from mabtpus, we have damlpus, so damlpus is fidvpus and legrpus and balkpus, and fidvpus is vuwtpus, and vuwtpus is banspus, so banspus is included, but banspus is miqgpus and sodjpus and jipgpus and ruggpus, which does not include nucxpus. nucxpus is from elsewhere.\n\nnucxpus is from jowxpus: \"jowxpus is nucxpus\" and \"wonvpus is jowxpus\" so wonvpus is nucxpus, and wonvpus is also under tudcpus: \"tudcpus is wonvpus\" and \"gecvpus is tudcpus\" and \"dubnpus is gecvpus\" etc., but from mabtpus, we don't have dubnpus directly. From mabtpus, we have titdpus is dubnpus and vavkpus, but titdpus is from wamxpus: \"wamxpus is titdpus\" and xegbpus is wamxpus, etc., but from mabtpus, we reached vadbpus, which is xoxjpus and kimnpus, not wamxpus.\n\nFrom the chain of mabtpus, we have from pultpus to yiqcpus to sirspus to qondpus to joqtpus to xigmpus to kikmpus to vadbpus, so vadbpus is reached, but vadbpus is xoxjpus and kimnpus, which is not related to wamxpus.\n\nwamxpus is from xegbpus: \"xegbpus is wamxpus and turwpus\" and \"lirspus is xegbpus\" etc., so different branch.\n\nSo it seems that mabtpus does not lead to wonvpus or nucxpus, so not to babmpus.\n\nSimilarly for babkpus, which is from qoslpus, and qoslpus is from wonvpus: \"wonvpus is qoslpus and qoxypus\" so wonvpus is qoslpus, so same as above, not connected to mabtpus.\n\nFor babgpus, from lerwpus, which is from yexbpus, and yexbpus is from bajlpus, and bajlpus is from zorvpus? But zorvpus is zibxpus, not directly bajlpus. From \"bajlpus is yexbpus\" and \"zorvpus is zibxpus\" but no connection between zorvpus and bajlpus. However, from \"xecypus is zorvpus and hefmpus\" and \"cehxpus is xecypus\" etc., but again, not connected to mabtpus.\n\nFrom another angle, lerwpus is also mentioned in yexbpus, and yexbpus is bajlpus, and bajlpus might be connected elsewhere, but from the information, bajlpus is only defined as yexbpus, so no other connections.\n\nSo, based on the given information, there is no path from mabtpus to babgpus, babkpus, or babmpus.\n\nTherefore, it is not true that x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus.\n\nBut the question is to say true, false, or unknown.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

          "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract:

compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\":

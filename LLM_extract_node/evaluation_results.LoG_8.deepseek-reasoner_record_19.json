And since sugbpus is dubxpus, and caylpus is sugbpus, and dezdpus is caylpus, and katcpus is dezdpus, and novcpus is katcpus, and tolkpus is novcpus, and zirnpus is tolkpus, and hucvpus is zirnpus, and zawqpus is hucvpus, and jahnpus is zawqpus, and jeflpus is jahnpus, and wolnpus is jeflpus, and mirfpus is wolnpus, and gejmpus is mirfpus, and guhzpus is gejmpus, and tupvpus is guhzpus, and rabypus is tupvpus, and mujdpus is rabypus, and tujjpus is mujdpus, and bedfpus is tujjpus, and vonwpus is bedfpus, and gacfpus is vonwpus, and vasbpus is gacfpus, and yohxpus is vasbpus, and vifkpus is yohxpus, and lomtpus is vifkpus, and makgpus is lomtpus, and wifkpus is makgpus, and fedppus is wifkpus, and burkpus is fedppus, and x is burkpus.\n\nTherefore, x is connected to burkpus, which is fedppus, which is wifkpus, and so on, all the way down to dubxpus, which is babbpus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is directly babbpus or if there is a chain that leads to babbpus.\n\nFrom the chain, since dubxpus is babbpus, and through the chain, x is related to dubxpus.\n\nBut let's see the direction.

  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus. From the given information, I see that \"palrpus is babgpus.\" Also, \"x is lamkpus and bukbpus.\" But I need to connect x to babgpus.\n\nI should list out all the relationships and see how they connect. The information is given in terms of categories, so I need to find a chain from x to babgpus.\n\nLet me list all the statements:\n\n1. palrpus is bokvpus.\n\n2. xiqppus is sotxpus and cackpus.\n\n3. tihqpus is xiqppus and vohwpus.\n\n4. jubxpus is loxfpus and goqnpus.\n\n5. laydpus is jubxpus.\n\n6. lamkpus is tihqpus and nagkpus.\n\n7. rizvpus is zogypus.\n\n8. cohypus is tuyjpus and wunbpus.\n\n9. sotxpus is yuvfpus and zirdpus.\n\n10. yuvfpus is kiqqpus.\n\n11. yaxwpus is jibtpus and pugfpus.\n\n12. palrpus is mesppus.  // This might be redundant or additional.\n\n13. zogypus is zoqspus.\n\n14. x is lamkpus and bukbpus.  // This is key for x.\n\n15. gelhpus is yaxwpus.\n\n16. kiqqpus is cohypus and pectpus.\n\n17. gavbpus is xudmpus and vasqpus.\n\n18. zoqspus is gavbpus.\n\n19. palrpus is babgpus.  // This is what we need for x.\n\n20. xudmpus is laydpus.\n\n21. loxfpus is palrpus and boqnpus.\n\n22. tuyjpus is gelhpus.\n\n23. yaxwpus is rizvpus.  // From 11 and 23, yaxwpus has multiple categories? But in this context, \"is\" might mean belongs to, so it can have multiple.\n\nAlso, from 15, gelhpus is yaxwpus, and from 22, tuyjpus is gelhpus, so tuyjpus is gelhpus which is yaxwpus, and from 23, yaxwpus is rizvpus, so tuyjpus is also rizvpus? But let's see.\n\nI need to focus on connecting x to babgpus.\n\nx is lamkpus and bukbpus. But we need babgpus, which is related to palrpus.\n\nSo, from x, we have lamkpus. What is lamkpus? From point 6: lamkpus is tihqpus and nagkpus.\n\nSo lamkpus includes tihqpus. Now, tihqpus is xiqppus and vohwpus (point 3).\n\nxiqppus is sotxpus and cackpus (point 2).\n\nsotxpus is yuvfpus and zirdpus (point 9).\n\nyuvfpus is kiqqpus (point 10).\n\nkiqqpus is cohypus and pectpus (point 16).\n\ncohypus is tuyjpus and wunbpus (point 8).\n\ntuyjpus is gelhpus (point 22).\n\ngelhpus is yaxwpus (point 15).\n\nyaxwpus is jibtpus and pugfpus (point 11), and also yaxwpus is rizvpus (point 23).\n\nrizvpus is zogypus (point 7).\n\nzogypus is zoqspus (point 13).\n\nzoqspus is gavbpus (point 18).\n\ngavbpus is xudmpus and vasqpus (point 17).\n\nxudmpus is laydpus (point 20).\n\nlaydpus is jubxpus (point 5).\n\njubxpus is loxfpus and goqnpus (point 4).\n\nloxfpus is palrpus and boqnpus (point 21).\n\nAnd palrpus is babgpus (point 19).\n\nSo, through this long chain, lamkpus eventually connects to palrpus, which is babgpus.\n\nBut x is lamkpus, so if lamkpus is a category that contains tihqpus, and so on, and eventually contains palrpus, then x, being lamkpus, should be in that category, so x should be babgpus? But we need to see if x is directly babgpus or through the chain.\n\nThe question is \"x is babgpus?\" meaning does x belong to babgpus.\n\nFrom the chain, since lamkpus includes tihqpus, which includes xiqppus, and so on, down to loxfpus which includes palrpus, and palrpus is babgpus, so lamkpus should include babgpus? But let's see the relationships.\n\nIn this hierarchy, when we say \"A is B\", it means A belongs to B, so B is a category that contains A. So if we have multiple levels, if A is B and B is C, then A is C, meaning A belongs to C.\n\nSimilarly, if a category contains multiple things, like lamkpus is tihqpus and nagkpus, that means lamkpus belongs to tihqpus and also to nagkpus? Or does it mean that lamkpus has categories tihqpus and nagkpus? I think I need to clarify the meaning.\n\nFrom the note: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \"\n\nSo, \"A is B\" means A is a subset of B or A is an instance of B. So, if A is B, then A ⊆ B or A ∈ B.\n\nBut in the statements, sometimes it says \"A is B and C\" which means A belongs to B and also to C, so A ⊆ B and A ⊆ C, or A ∈ B and A ∈ C.\n\nSimilarly, for categories, if we have \"category A is category B\", it might mean that A is a subcategory of B.\n\nBut in this case, we have things like \"lamkpus is tihqpus and nagkpus\" which means lamkpus belongs to tihqpus and to nagkpus, so lamkpus ⊆ tihqpus and lamkpus ⊆ nagkpus.\n\nThen, from point 14, x is lamkpus and bukbpus, so x belongs to lamkpus and to bukbpus, so x ∈ lamkpus.\n\nSince lamkpus ⊆ tihqpus, then x ∈ tihqpus, and so on.\n\nWe need to see if x ∈ babgpus.\n\nFrom above, babgpus is related to palrpus: palrpus is babgpus, meaning palrpus belongs to babgpus, so palrpus ∈ babgpus.\n\nBut we need x to be in babgpus, so we need to see if x is palrpus or if x is in a category that is in babgpus.\n\nFrom the chain, we have loxfpus is palrpus and boqnpus, so loxfpus ∈ palrpus and loxfpus ∈ boqnpus? No: \"loxfpus is palrpus and boqnpus\" means loxfpus belongs to palrpus and to boqnpus, so loxfpus ⊆ palrpus and loxfpus ⊆ boqnpus? Or loxfpus ∈ palrpus? This is confusing.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nIf \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, then for a category, if we say \"category A is category B\", it might mean that category A is a subset of category B, so all elements of A are in B.\n\nBut in the statements, we have names like palrpus, which might be entities or categories.\n\nFrom the context, things like palrpus, xiqppus, etc., seem to be categories themselves, because they are used in \"is\" statements.\n\nFor example, \"palrpus is bokvpus\" means the category palrpus belongs to bokvpus, so palrpus is a subcategory of bokvpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"x is lamkpus\" means x is an instance of lamkpus.\n\nSo, for the question \"x is babgpus?\" it means is x an instance of babgpus.\n\nbabgpus is a category, and from \"palrpus is babgpus\", it means that the category palrpus is a subcategory of babgpus, so any instance of palrpus is also an instance of babgpus.\n\nBut we need to see if x is an instance of palrpus or indirectly through other categories.\n\nFrom x: x is lamkpus, so x is an instance of lamkpus.\n\nlamkpus is tihqpus and nagkpus, so lamkpus is a subcategory of tihqpus and of nagkpus, so instances of lamkpus are also instances of tihqpus.\n\nSimilarly, tihqpus is xiqppus and vohwpus, so tihqpus is subcategory of xiqppus and vohwpus, so instances of tihqpus are instances of xiqppus, and so on.\n\nWe need to follow the chain to see if instances of lamkpus are instances of palrpus.\n\nFrom the chain above, we have through various steps, but let's see the connection to palrpus.\n\nFrom loxfpus is palrpus and boqnpus, so loxfpus is a subcategory of palrpus, so instances of loxfpus are instances of palrpus.\n\nNow, where does loxfpus come from? From jubxpus is loxfpus and goqnpus, so jubxpus is subcategory of loxfpus, so instances of jubxpus are instances of loxfpus.\n\nlaydpus is jubxpus, so laydpus is subcategory of jubxpus, so instances of laydpus are instances of jubxpus.\n\nxudmpus is laydpus, so xudmpus is subcategory of laydpus, so instances of xudmpus are instances of laydpus.\n\ngavbpus is xudmpus and vasqpus, so gavbpus is subcategory of xudmpus, so instances of gavbpus are instances of xudmpus.\n\nzoqspus is gavbpus, so zoqspus is subcategory of gavbpus, so instances of zoqspus are instances of gavbpus.\n\nzogypus is zoqspus, so zogypus is subcategory of zoqspus, so instances of zogypus are instances of zoqspus.\n\nrizvpus is zogypus, so rizvpus is subcategory of zogypus, so instances of rizvpus are instances of zogypus.\n\nyaxwpus is rizvpus, so yaxwpus is subcategory of rizvpus, so instances of yaxwpus are instances of rizvpus.\n\ngelhpus is yaxwpus, so gelhpus is subcategory of yaxwpus, so instances of gelhpus are instances of yaxwpus.\n\ntuyjpus is gelhpus, so tuyjpus is subcategory of gelhpus, so instances of tuyjpus are instances of gelhpus.\n\ncohypus is tuyjpus and wunbpus, so cohypus is subcategory of tuyjpus, so instances of cohypus are instances of tuyjpus.\n\nkiqqpus is cohypus and pectpus, so kiqqpus is subcategory of cohypus, so instances of kiqqpus are instances of cohypus.\n\nyuvfpus is kiqqpus, so yuvfpus is subcategory of kiqqpus, so instances of yuvfpus are instances of kiqqpus.\n\nsotxpus is yuvfpus and zirdpus, so sotxpus is subcategory of yuvfpus, so instances of sotxpus are instances of yuvfpus.\n\nxiqppus is sotxpus and cackpus, so xiqppus is subcategory of sotxpus, so instances of xiqppus are instances of sotxpus.\n\ntihqpus is xiqppus and vohwpus, so tihqpus is subcategory of xiqppus, so instances of tihqpus are instances of xiqppus.\n\nlamkpus is tihqpus and nagkpus, so lamkpus is subcategory of tihqpus, so instances of lamkpus are instances of tihqpus.\n\nTherefore, instances of lamkpus are instances of tihqpus, which are instances of xiqppus, and so on, all the way down to instances of loxfpus, which are instances of palrpus.\n\nSince palrpus is babgpus, instances of palrpus are instances of babgpus.\n\nSo, ultimately, instances of lamkpus are instances of babgpus.\n\nx is an instance of lamkpus, so x is an instance of babgpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus.\n\nSo, it should be true.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any break in the chain.\n\nWe have lamkpus -> tihqpus -> xiqppus -> sotxpus -> yuvfpus -> kiqqpus -> cohypus -> tuyjpus -> gelhpus -> yaxwpus -> rizvpus -> zogypus -> zoqspus -> gavbpus -> xudmpus -> laydpus -> jubxpus -> loxfpus -> palrpus -> babgpus.\n\nYes, the chain is complete.\n\nAlso, from point 19, palrpus is babgpus, so directly.\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.",

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

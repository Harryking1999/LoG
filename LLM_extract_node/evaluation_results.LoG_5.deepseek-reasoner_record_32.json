The note says that \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B, not that A equals B.\n\nHere's the information listed out:\n\n- siqtpus is babspus and rafnpus.\n\n- widlpus is hokypus and qufppus and yinvpus.\n\n- sorgpus is wiggpus and wiqwpus.\n\n- hokypus is sorgpus.\n\n- wiggpus is siqtpus.\n\n- wiggpus is babcpus and babrpus and qebgpus.\n\n- x is widlpus and lacbpus.\n\nThe question is: Is it true or false or unknown that x is babcpus and babrpus and babspus?\n\nI need to trace the categories for x. Since x is widlpus and lacbpus, I should focus on widlpus because that might connect to the other categories.\n\nFrom the given:\n\nwidlpus is hokypus and qufppus and yinvpus.\n\nSo, widlpus belongs to hokypus, qufppus, and yinvpus.\n\nBut I need to see if widlpus (and thus x) belongs to babcpus, babrpus, and babspus.\n\nNow, I see that hokypus is sorgpus. So, since widlpus is hokypus, and hokypus is sorgpus, that means widlpus is also sorgpus? Because if A is B and B is C, then A is C? But I need to be careful with the meaning. \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if A belongs to B and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C? That seems logical, so I think we can assume transitivity here.\n\nSimilarly, sorgpus is wiggpus and wiqwpus. So if widlpus is sorgpus, then widlpus is wiggpus and wiqwpus.\n\nBut wiggpus is siqtpus, and wiggpus is also babcpus and babrpus and qebgpus.\n\nAlso, siqtpus is babspus and rafnpus.\n\nSo, let's start from x.\n\nx is widlpus. So whatever applies to widlpus applies to x.\n\nwidlpus is hokypus.\n\nhokypus is sorgpus.\n\nTherefore, widlpus is sorgpus.\n\nsorgpus is wiggpus and wiqwpus.\n\nTherefore, widlpus is wiggpus.\n\nwiggpus is siqtpus.\n\nTherefore, widlpus is siqtpus.\n\nwiggpus is babcpus and babrpus and qebgpus.\n\nSince widlpus is wiggpus, then widlpus is babcpus and babrpus and qebgpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus and babrpus (since x is widlpus).\n\nBut the question also includes babspus. So we need to see if x is babspus.\n\nFrom above, widlpus is siqtpus (since wiggpus is siqtpus and widlpus is wiggpus).\n\nsiqtpus is babspus and rafnpus.\n\nTherefore, widlpus is babspus.\n\nThus, x is babspus.\n\nSo, x is babcpus, babrpus, and babspus.\n\nTherefore, it should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any missing links.\n\nWe have x is widlpus and lacbpus, but lacbpus isn't mentioned in any other categories, so it doesn't affect this reasoning. We only care about the categories babcpus, babrpus, and babspus, which we've covered through widlpus.\n\nSo, from widlpus, we derived that it is wiggpus, and wiggpus is babcpus and babrpus, and through siqtpus, it is babspus.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.",

IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

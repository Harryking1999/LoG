  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is both babgpus and babkpus. From the given information, x is defined in two places:\n\n1. \"x is pohppus\" – so x belongs to pohppus.\n\n2. \"x is dunmpus\" – so x also belongs to dunmpus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is babgpus and babkpus. So I have to trace what pohppus and dunmpus are, and see if they lead to babgpus and babkpus.\n\nLet me list out the relevant statements.\n\nStart with pohppus: \"pohppus is geyhpus and jupkpus.\"\n\nSo pohppus belongs to geyhpus and jupkpus. But I need babgpus and babkpus, so I need to follow geyhpus and jupkpus.\n\nFirst, geyhpus: \"geyhpus is fulcpus.\" So geyhpus belongs to fulcpus.\n\nfulcpus: \"fulcpus is mewppus and bebgpus and zozdpus.\" So fulcpus belongs to mewppus, bebgpus, and zozdpus. Here, bebgpus is mentioned, but I need babgpus, which might be different. babgpus sounds similar, but it's probably a typo or different entity. Let's check the names carefully.\n\nThe question is about babgpus and babkpus. From the given, I see \"fuwrpus is babgpus and sinspus.\" So babgpus is a category that fuwrpus belongs to.\n\nBut I need to see if x is babgpus. So from above, fulcpus has bebgpus, which is not babgpus. bebgpus vs babgpus – they are different. So probably, from geyhpus -> fulcpus -> bebgpus, which is not babgpus. So that path doesn't lead to babgpus.\n\nNow, jupkpus: I don't see any direct link from jupkpus to babgpus. So from pohppus, I might not get to babgpus.\n\nNow, x is also dunmpus: \"x is dunmpus\"\n\ndunmpus: \"dunmpus is cancpus and biqhpus.\"\n\ncancpus: \"cancpus is hifbpus\" and also \"cancpus is refmpus\" – wait, multiple statements? Let's see.\n\n\"cancpus is hifbpus.\" and later \"cancpus is refmpus.\" But in this context, \"is\" means belongs to, so cancpus belongs to both hifbpus and refmpus? That might be possible, but let's see.\n\nFrom \"cancpus is hifbpus\" and \"cancpus is refmpus\", so cancpus is in both categories.\n\nBut I need babgpus and babkpus.\n\nFirst, hifbpus: \"hifbpus is napnpus.\"\n\nnapnpus: \"napnpus is bevypus and vuzzpus.\"\n\nbevypus: \"bevypus is vocspus and fanhpus and cayrpus.\"\n\nvocspus: \"vocspus is xiwmpus and luzxpus.\"\n\nxiwmpus: \"xiwmpus is johppus and gocmpus.\"\n\njohppus: \"johppus is wedtpus and tibtpus.\"\n\nwedtpus: \"wedtpus is licmpus.\"\n\nlicmpus: \"licmpus is xubkpus.\"\n\nxubkpus: \"xubkpus is nidspus.\" and also \"xubkpus is derqpus.\" – again multiple.\n\nnidspus: \"nidspus is yabjpus.\"\n\nyabjpus: \"yabjpus is mibypus and nejtpus.\"\n\nmibypus: \"mibypus is cuzppus and popjpus.\"\n\ncuzppus: \"cuzppus is gorppus.\"\n\ngorppus: \"gorppus is hakypus.\"\n\nhakypus: \"hakypus is niyjpus.\"\n\nniyjpus: \"niyjpus is fatbpus and vavypus.\"\n\nfatbpus: \"fatbpus is haphpus.\"\n\nhaphpus: \"haphpus is hixzpus and xommpus.\"\n\nhixzpus: \"hixzpus is kelspus.\"\n\nkelspus: \"kelspus is dojspus and venlpus.\"\n\ndojspus: \"dojspus is vizcpus.\"\n\nvizcpus: \"vizcpus is nifkpus.\"\n\nnifkpus: \"nifkpus is subtpus.\"\n\nsubtpus: \"subtpus is paqvpus.\"\n\npaqvpus: \"paqvpus is boxzpus and huhkpus.\"\n\nboxzpus: \"boxzpus is hamfpus and negtpus and kiptpus.\"\n\nhamfpus: \"hamfpus is mickpus.\" and \"hamfpus is farcpus.\"\n\nmickpus: \"mickpus is kobdpus.\"\n\nkobdpus: \"kobdpus is faqbpus and wugfpus and lavspus.\"\n\nThis is getting very long, and I don't see babgpus or babkpus here. I need a better approach.\n\nI recall that I need babgpus and babkpus. From the given, babgpus is mentioned in \"fuwrpus is babgpus and sinspus.\" and babkpus is mentioned in \"pabkpus is babkpus and qemwpus and birvpus.\" and also \"konppus is pabkpus.\" so konppus belongs to pabkpus, which has babkpus.\n\nBut I need x to be babgpus and babkpus, meaning x belongs to both categories.\n\nSince x is dunmpus, and dunmpus is cancpus and biqhpus, let's see if cancpus leads to babgpus or babkpus.\n\ncancpus is hifbpus, and hifbpus is napnpus, napnpus is bevypus, etc. – that path seems unrelated to babgpus.\n\ncancpus is also refmpus: \"refmpus is nigmpus.\" but no link to babgpus.\n\nPerhaps from biqhpus? But biqhpus is not defined anywhere else, so I don't know what biqhpus is. Similarly, from pohppus, I have geyhpus and jupkpus, but neither seems to lead to babgpus or babkpus.\n\nAnother thought: x is pohppus, and pohppus is geyhpus and jupkpus, but geyhpus is fulcpus, and fulcpus is mewppus and bebgpus and zozdpus. bebgpus is not babgpus, so no babgpus.\n\nBut let's check if there is a connection elsewhere.\n\nI see that \"fuwrpus is babgpus and sinspus.\" and fuwrpus is related to nibbpus: \"nibbpus is fuwrpus.\" and hecdpus is nibbpus: \"hecdpus is nibbpus and kugqpus.\" and xiyrpus is hecdpus: \"xiyrpus is hecdpus.\" but xiyrpus is also savrpus and gipdpus, and xiyrpus is vakwpus? No, \"vakwpus is xiyrpus and doctpus.\" so vakwpus belongs to xiyrpus.\n\nBut x is not directly xiyrpus. x is pohppus and dunmpus.\n\nFrom dunmpus, cancpus is hifbpus, hifbpus is napnpus, napnpus is bevypus, bevypus is vocspus, etc. – no babgpus.\n\nPerhaps from another path.\n\nLet's list all statements that include babgpus or babkpus.\n\nbabgpus is only mentioned in \"fuwrpus is babgpus and sinspus.\" so to have x be babgpus, x must be fuwrpus or belong to something that belongs to fuwrpus, etc.\n\nSimilarly, babkpus is mentioned in \"pabkpus is babkpus and qemwpus and birvpus.\" so babkpus is a category that pabkpus belongs to, so for x to be babkpus, x must be pabkpus or belong to pabkpus.\n\nBut pabkpus is also mentioned in \"konppus is pabkpus.\" so konppus belongs to pabkpus.\n\nNow, is x related to konppus or pabkpus?\n\nFrom the given, I see \"jufnpus is konppus.\" so jufnpus belongs to konppus.\n\nAnd \"jufnpus is dokypus.\" so jufnpus belongs to dokypus.\n\nBut x is not directly jufnpus.\n\nx is dunmpus, and dunmpus is cancpus and biqhpus. cancpus is refmpus, etc., but no link to jufnpus.\n\nx is also pohppus, pohppus is geyhpus, geyhpus is fulcpus, fulcpus is mewppus, mewppus is loxfpus, loxfpus is vadqpus, vadqpus is xadhpus and kovspus, xadhpus is tagtpus, tagtpus is bixtpus, bixtpus is xopcpus and zosmpus, xopcpus is qulqpus, qulqpus is bewnpus and mugvpus, bewnpus is sogjpus, sogjpus is gurkpus, gurkpus is veznpus and sufkpus, veznpus is botfpus, botfpus is zefnpus and xilrpus, zefnpus is lughpus, lughpus is suczpus, suczpus is jicjpus, jicjpus is jebqpus, jebqpus is momqpus, momqpus is kutbpus and tubspus, kutbpus is yekmpus, yekmpus is lelkpus and zothpus and jegvpus, lelkpus is sobfpus and vedjpus, sobfpus is kegrpus and begtpus and cilxpus, kegrpus is hunfpus, hunfpus is naqdpus, naqdpus is lahkpus and navfpus, lahkpus is lodfpus, lodfpus is cidtpus and tadlpus, cidtpus is palspus, palspus is reflpus, reflpus is fadgpus and miwmpus, fadgpus is pazlpus, pazlpus is giwspus and zucjpus and rufwpus, giwspus is besxpus, besxpus is sucrpus, sucrpus is sifspus and zipppus, sifspus is kokwpus and also sifspus is tejrpus, tejrpus is waddpus, waddpus is mapvpus, mapvpus is mucwpus, mucwpus is tajxpus and pedbpus, tajxpus is parvpus and kikcpus and also tajxpus is fexjpus and ziqlpus, fexjpus is gelfpus, ziqlpus is lekhpus, lekhpus is xicspus, xicspus is xuqppus, xuqppus is jibgpus and qolppus, jibgpus is kavrpus and lejbpus, kavrpus is salrpus and xerjpus, salrpus is kavjpus, kavjpus is zufbpus, zufbpus is vakwpus, vakwpus is xiyrpus and doctpus, xiyrpus is savrpus and gipdpus and hecdpus and qowppus, hecdpus is nibbpus and kugqpus, nibbpus is fuwrpus, fuwrpus is babgpus and sinspus.\n\nFinally! So from this long chain, we see that fuwrpus is babgpus, and since nibbpus is fuwrpus, hecdpus is nibbpus, xiyrpus is hecdpus, vakwpus is xiyrpus, zufbpus is vakwpus, kavjpus is zufbpus, salrpus is kavjpus, kavrpus is salrpus, jibgpus is kavrpus, xuqppus is jibgpus, xicspus is xuqppus, lekhpus is xicspus, ziqlpus is lekhpus, tajxpus is ziqlpus, mucwpus is tajxpus, mapvpus is mucwpus, waddpus is mapvpus, tejrpus is waddpus, sifspus is tejrpus, sucrpus is sifspus, besxpus is sucrpus, giwspus is besxpus, pazlpus is giwspus, fadgpus is pazlpus, reflpus is fadgpus, palspus is reflpus, cidtpus is palspus, lodfpus is cidtpus, lahkpus is lodfpus, naqdpus is lahkpus, hunfpus is naqdpus, kegrpus is hunfpus, sobfpus is kegrpus, lelkpus is sobfpus, yekmpus is lelkpus, kutbpus is yekmpus, momqpus is kutbpus, jebqpus is momqpus, jicjpus is jebqpus, suczpus is jicjpus, lughpus is suczpus, zefnpus is lughpus, botfpus is zefnpus, veznpus is botfpus, gurkpus is veznpus, sogjpus is gurkpus, bewnpus is sogjpus, qulqpus is bewnpus, xopcpus is qulqpus, bixtpus is xopcpus, tagtpus is bixtpus, xadhpus is tagtpus, vadqpus is xadhpus, loxfpus is vadqpus, mewppus is loxfpus, fulcpus is mewppus, geyhpus is fulcpus, pohppus is geyhpus, and x is pohppus.\n\nTherefore, since x is pohppus, and through this chain, x eventually belongs to fuwrpus, which is babgpus. So x is babgpus.\n\nNow, we need to check if x is also babkpus.\n\nbabkpus is from pabkpus: \"pabkpus is babkpus and qemwpus and birvpus.\"\n\nAnd \"konppus is pabkpus.\" so konppus belongs to pabkpus.\n\nNow, we need to see if x belongs to konppus or pabkpus.\n\nFrom the given, we have \"jufnpus is konppus.\" so jufnpus belongs to konppus.\n\nAnd \"jufnpus is dokypus.\" so jufnpus belongs to dokypus.\n\nBut is x related to jufnpus?\n\nx is pohppus, and from above, we have a chain from pohppus to fuwrpus, but that doesn't include jufnpus.\n\nx is also dunmpus: \"x is dunmpus\"\n\ndunmpus is cancpus and biqhpus.\n\ncancpus is hifbpus and refmpus.\n\nhifbpus is napnpus.\n\nnapnpus is bevypus and vuzzpus.\n\nbevypus is vocspus and fanhpus and cayrpus.\n\nvocspus is xiwmpus and luzxpus.\n\nxiwmpus is johppus and gocmpus.\n\njohppus is wedtpus and tibtpus.\n\nwedtpus is licmpus.\n\nlicmpus is xubkpus.\n\nxubkpus is nidspus and derqpus.\n\nnidspus is yabjpus.\n\nyabjpus is mibypus and nejtpus.\n\nmibypus is cuzppus and popjpus.\n\ncuzppus is gorppus.\n\ngorppus is hakypus.\n\nhakypus is niyjpus.\n\nniyjpus is fatbpus and vavypus.\n\nfatbpus is haphpus.\n\nhaphpus is hixzpus and xommpus.\n\nhixzpus is kelspus.\n\nkelspus is dojspus and venlpus.\n\ndojspus is vizcpus.\n\nvizcpus is nifkpus.\n\nnifkpus is subtpus.\n\nsubtpus is paqvpus.\n\npaqvpus is boxzpus and huhkpus.\n\nboxzpus is hamfpus and negtpus and kiptpus.\n\nhamfpus is mickpus and farcpus.\n\nmickpus is kobdpus.\n\nkobdpus is faqbpus and wugfpus and lavspus.\n\nThis doesn't seem to lead to konppus or pabkpus.\n\nNow, cancpus is also refmpus: \"refmpus is nigmpus.\" but nigmpus is not defined, so probably no link.\n\nbiqhpus is not defined, so no help.\n\nFrom another path, x is pohppus, and we have the long chain to fuwrpus, but that doesn't include konppus.\n\nWe need to see if there is a connection from pohppus to konppus.\n\npohppus is also jupkpus, but jupkpus is not defined elsewhere, so no.\n\nPerhaps from dunmpus, but we already tried.\n\nAnother thing: from the given, we have \"majxpus is jufnpus and qogvpus and tawnpus.\" and \"tegppus is majxpus.\" and \"mazdpus is tegppus and dimzpus.\" and \"fenmpus is mazdpus.\" and \"zoxcpus is fenmpus and tuhkpus.\" and \"zuzxpus is zoxcpus.\" and \"nasdpus is zuzxpus and jikkpus.\" and \"farcpus is nasdpus.\" and \"hamfpus is farcpus.\" but from above, hamfpus is in boxzpus, which is in paqvpus, etc., but this is from cancpus path, which we have, but it doesn't lead to jufnpus directly.\n\nFrom hamfpus is farcpus, farcpus is nasdpus, nasdpus is zuzxpus and jikkpus, zuzxpus is zoxcpus, zoxcpus is fenmpus and tuhkpus, fenmpus is mazdpus, mazdpus is tegppus and dimzpus, tegppus is majxpus, majxpus is jufnpus and qogvpus and tawnpus, so majxpus belongs to jufnpus? No: \"majxpus is jufnpus\" means majxpus belongs to jufnpus? But from the statement, \"majxpus is jufnpus and qogvpus and tawnpus\" so majxpus belongs to jufnpus, meaning jufnpus is a category that contains majxpus.\n\nBut for x to be babkpus, x needs to be pabkpus or belong to pabkpus, and since konppus is pabkpus, if x belongs to konppus, then x belongs to pabkpus, thus babkpus.\n\nBut konppus is belongs to pabkpus, so if x belongs to konppus, then x belongs to pabkpus, which belongs to babkpus, so x belongs to babkpus.\n\nBut we need x to be babkpus, which means x belongs to babkpus, so yes, if x belongs to pabkpus, then since pabkpus belongs to babkpus, x belongs to babkpus.\n\nSimilarly, if x belongs to konppus, which belongs to pabkpus, which belongs to babkpus, so x belongs to babkpus.\n\nSo we need to see if x belongs to konppus.\n\nNow, konppus is mentioned in \"jufnpus is konppus\" which means jufnpus belongs to konppus? No, let's read carefully.\n\nIn this context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so \"jufnpus is konppus\" means jufnpus belongs to konppus. So konppus is a category that contains jufnpus.\n\nTherefore, for x to belong to konppus, x must be jufnpus or belong to something that belongs to konppus.\n\nBut from the statements, we have that majxpus belongs to jufnpus, so majxpus is in jufnpus, but jufnpus is in konppus, so majxpus is in konppus? Let's think about the hierarchy.\n\nIf jufnpus belongs to konppus, that means konppus is a broader category that includes jufnpus. So any thing that belongs to jufnpus also belongs to konppus, because belonging is transitive? In set theory, if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C, then A ⊆ C. Similarly here, if x belongs to jufnpus, and jufnpus belongs to konppus, then x belongs to konppus.\n\nBut in this context, \"A is B\" means A is an instance of B or A is contained in B, so yes, it should be transitive.\n\nSo if x belongs to jufnpus, then since jufnpus belongs to konppus, x belongs to konppus.\n\nThen since konppus belongs to pabkpus, x belongs to pabkpus, and since pabkpus belongs to babkpus, x belongs to babkpus.\n\nSo we need to see if x belongs to jufnpus.\n\nNow, from the given, is x related to jufnpus?\n\nx is dunmpus, and dunmpus is cancpus and biqhpus.\n\nWe need to see if cancpus or biqhpus leads to jufnpus.\n\nFrom cancpus, we have cancpus is hifbpus, etc., but we also have cancpus is refmpus, but refmpus is nigmpus, not helpful.\n\nFrom the other path, we have from hamfpus to majxpus as above.\n\nBut from cancpus, we have hamfpus? From earlier, from cancpus: cancpus is hifbpus, hifbpus is napnpus, napnpus is bevypus, bevypus is vocspus, vocspus is xiwmpus, xiwmpus is johppus, johppus is wedtpus, wedtpus is licmpus, licmpus is xubkpus, xubkpus is derqpus? Or nidspus? But let's see derqpus: \"derqpus is hulrpus and yijbpus.\" and hulrpus is voqhpus and also hulrpus is kiwmpus, etc., not sure.\n\nFrom xubkpus is derqpus, derqpus is hulrpus, hulrpus is voqhpus, voqhpus is hidtpus, etc., not leading to jufnpus.\n\nFrom xubkpus is nidspus, nidspus is yabjpus, etc., as before.\n\nBut from hamfpus, we have hamfpus is farcpus, which is from cancpus? cancpus is hifbpus, but hifbpus is napnpus, napnpus is bevypus, bevypus is vocspus, vocspus is xiwmpus, xiwmpus is johppus, johppus is wedtpus, wedtpus is licmpus, licmpus is xubkpus, xubkpus is derqpus? No, from licmpus is xubkpus, and xubkpus is nidspus and derqpus, but derqpus is hulrpus, and hulrpus is kiwmpus, kiwmpus is fanypus, etc., not hamfpus.\n\nhamfpus is in boxzpus: from subtpus is paqvpus, paqvpus is boxzpus, boxzpus is hamfpus, so from nifkpus is subtpus, nifkpus is vizcpus, vizcpus is dojspus, dojspus is kelspus, kelspus is hixzpus, hixzpus is haphpus, haphpus is fatbpus, fatbpus is niyjpus, niyjpus is hakypus, hakypus is gorppus, gorppus is cuzppus, cuzppus is mibypus, mibypus is yabjpus, yabjpus is nidspus, nidspus is xubkpus, xubkpus is licmpus, licmpus is wedtpus, wedtpus is johppus, johppus is xiwmpus, xiwmpus is vocspus, vocspus is bevypus, bevypus is napnpus, napnpus is hifbpus, hifbpus is cancpus, cancpus is dunmpus, and dunmpus is x? But x is dunmpus, so from this, x belongs to cancpus, which belongs to hifbpus, etc., down to hamfpus? Let's see: from bevypus to vocspus to xiwmpus to johppus to wedtpus to licmpus to xubkpus to nidspus to yabjpus to mibypus to cuzppus to gorppus to hakypus to niyjpus to fatbpus to haphpus to hixzpus to kelspus to dojspus to vizcpus to nifkpus to subtpus to paqvpus to boxzpus to hamfpus. So yes, eventually, from cancpus, we reach hamfpus.\n\nSo x belongs to cancpus, which belongs to hifbpus, ..., which belongs to boxzpus, which belongs to hamfpus? No: boxzpus is hamfpus and negtpus and kiptpus, so boxzpus belongs to hamfpus? Let's read: \"boxzpus is hamfpus and negtpus and kiptpus\" so boxzpus belongs to hamfpus? Or does it mean hamfpus is part of boxzpus? In the context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so \"boxzpus is hamfpus\" means boxzpus belongs to hamfpus. So hamfpus is a category that contains boxzpus.\n\nTherefore, from above, we have that x belongs to cancpus, which belongs to hifbpus, ... and so on, through the chain, we have that x belongs to paqvpus (since subtpus is paqvpus, and nifkpus is subtpus, etc., but let's see the direction.\n\nFrom x is dunmpus, dunmpus is cancpus, so x belongs to cancpus.\n\ncancpus is hifbpus, so x belongs to hifbpus.\n\nhifbpus is napnpus, so x belongs to napnpus.\n\nnapnpus is bevypus, so x belongs to bevypus.\n\nbevypus is vocspus, so x belongs to vocspus.\n\nvocspus is xiwmpus and luzxpus, so x belongs to xiwmpus.\n\nxiwmpus is johppus and gocmpus, so x belongs to johppus.\n\njohppus is wedtpus and tibtpus, so x belongs to wedtpus.\n\nwedtpus is licmpus, so x belongs to licmpus.\n\nlicmpus is xubkpus, so x belongs to xubkpus.\n\nxubkpus is nidspus and derqpus, so x belongs to nidspus (and derqpus, but we focus on nidspus).\n\nnidspus is yabjpus, so x belongs to yabjpus.\n\nyabjpus is mibypus and nejtpus, so x belongs to mibypus.\n\nmibypus is cuzppus and popjpus, so x belongs to cuzppus.\n\ncuzppus is gorppus, so x belongs to gorppus.\n\ngorppus is hakypus, so x belongs to hakypus.\n\nhakypus is niyjpus, so x belongs to niyjpus.\n\nniyjpus is fatbpus and vavypus, so x belongs to fatbpus.\n\nfatbpus is haphpus, so x belongs to haphpus.\n\nhaphpus is hixzpus and xommpus, so x belongs to hixzpus.\n\nhixzpus is kelspus, so x belongs to kelspus.\n\nkelspus is dojspus and venlpus, so x belongs to dojspus.\n\ndojspus is vizcpus, so x belongs to vizcpus.\n\nvizcpus is nifkpus, so x belongs to nifkpus.\n\nnifkpus is subtpus, so x belongs to subtpus.\n\nsubtpus is paqvpus, so x belongs to paqvpus.\n\npaqvpus is boxzpus and huhkpus, so x belongs to boxzpus.\n\nboxzpus is hamfpus and negtpus and kiptpus, so x belongs to hamfpus.\n\nTherefore, x belongs to hamfpus.\n\nNow, from hamfpus, we have \"hamfpus is farcpus\" so hamfpus belongs to farcpus? Or? \"hamfpus is farcpus\" means hamfpus belongs to farcpus? But earlier we have \"hamfpus is mickpus\" which means hamfpus belongs to mickpus? This seems confusing.\n\nLet's read the statements: \"hamfpus is mickpus.\" and \"hamfpus is farcpus.\" so according to the context, hamfpus belongs to both mickpus and farcpus. So mickpus and farcpus are categories that contain hamfpus.\n\nBut for our purpose, we need to get to jufnpus.\n\nFrom \"hamfpus is farcpus\" so x belongs to hamfpus, which belongs to farcpus, so x belongs to farcpus.\n\nNow, \"farcpus is nasdpus\" so farcpus belongs to nasdpus, so x belongs to nasdpus.\n\n\"nasdpus is zuzxpus and jikkpus\" so nasdpus belongs to zuzxpus, so x belongs to zuzxpus.\n\n\"zuzxpus is zoxcpus\" so zuzxpus belongs to zoxcpus, so x belongs to zoxcpus.\n\n\"zoxcpus is fenmpus and tuhkpus\" so zoxcpus belongs to fenmpus, so x belongs to fenmpus.\n\n\"fenmpus is mazdpus\" so fenmpus belongs to mazdpus, so x belongs to mazdpus.\n\n\"mazdpus is tegppus and dimzpus\" so mazdpus belongs to tegppus, so x belongs to tegppus.\n\n\"tegppus is majxpus\" so tegppus belongs to majxpus, so x belongs to majxpus.\n\n\"majxpus is jufnpus and qogvpus and tawnpus\" so majxpus belongs to jufnpus, so x belongs to jufnpus.\n\nTherefore, x belongs to jufnpus.\n\nNow, from \"jufnpus is konppus\" so jufnpus belongs to konppus, so since x belongs to jufnpus, x belongs to konppus.\n\nThen from \"konppus is pabkpus\" so konppus belongs to pabkpus, so x belongs to pabkpus.\n\nThen from \"pabkpus is babkpus and qemwpus and birvpus\" so pabkpus belongs to babkpus, so x belongs to babkpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babkpus.\n\nWe already have that x is babgpus from the first chain.\n\nSo x is both babgpus and babkpus.\n\nThus, the statement is true.\n\nSo to summarize: from x is pohppus, we derived that x is babgpus through the long chain involving fuwrpus.\n\nFrom x is dunmpus, we derived that x is babkpus through the chain involving hamfpus, farcpus, etc., to jufnpus, konppus, pabkpus.\n\nTherefore, it is true.",
  "thinking_text": "First, I need to determine if x is both babgpus and babkpus. From the given information, x is defined in two places:\n\n1. \"x is pohppus\" – so x belongs to pohppus.\n\n2. \"x is dunmpus\" – so x also belongs to dunmpus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is babgpus and babkpus. So I have to trace what pohppus and dunmpus are, and see if they lead to babgpus and babkpus.\n\nLet me list out the relevant statements.\n\nStart with pohppus: \"pohppus is geyhpus and jupkpus.\"\n\nSo pohppus belongs to geyhpus and jupkpus. But I need babgpus and babkpus, so I need to follow geyhpus and jupkpus.\n\nFirst, geyhpus: \"geyhpus is fulcpus.\" So geyhpus belongs to fulcpus.\n\nfulcpus: \"fulcpus is mewppus and bebgpus and zozdpus.\" So fulcpus belongs to mewppus, bebgpus, and zozdpus. Here, bebgpus is mentioned, but I need babgpus, which might be different. babgpus sounds similar, but it's probably a typo or different entity. Let's check the names carefully.\n\nThe question is about babgpus and babkpus. From the given, I see \"fuwrpus is babgpus and sinspus.\" So babgpus is a category that fuwrpus belongs to.\n\nBut I need to see if x is babgpus. So from above, fulcpus has bebgpus, which is not babgpus. bebgpus vs babgpus – they are different. So probably, from geyhpus -> fulcpus -> bebgpus, which is not babgpus. So that path doesn't lead to babgpus.\n\nNow, jupkpus: I don't see any direct link from jupkpus to babgpus. So from pohppus, I might not get to babgpus.\n\nNow, x is also dunmpus: \"x is dunmpus\"\n\ndunmpus: \"dunmpus is cancpus and biqhpus.\"\n\ncancpus: \"cancpus is hifbpus\" and also \"cancpus is refmpus\" – wait, multiple statements? Let's see.\n\n\"cancpus is hifbpus.\" and later \"cancpus is refmpus.\" But in this context, \"is\" means belongs to, so cancpus belongs to both hifbpus and refmpus? That might be possible, but let's see.\n\nFrom \"cancpus is hifbpus\" and \"cancpus is refmpus\", so cancpus is in both categories.\n\nBut I need babgpus and babkpus.\n\nFirst, hifbpus: \"hifbpus is napnpus.\"\n\nnapnpus: \"napnpus is bevypus and vuzzpus.\"\n\nbevypus: \"bevypus is vocspus and fanhpus and cayrpus.\"\n\nvocspus: \"vocspus is xiwmpus and luzxpus.\"\n\nxiwmpus: \"xiwmpus is johppus and gocmpus.\"\n\njohppus: \"johppus is wedtpus and tibtpus.\"\n\nwedtpus: \"wedtpus is licmpus.\"\n\nlicmpus: \"licmpus is xubkpus.\"\n\nxubkpus: \"xubkpus is nidspus.\" and also \"xubkpus is derqpus.\" – again multiple.\n\nnidspus: \"nidspus is yabjpus.\"\n\nyabjpus: \"yabjpus is mibypus and nejtpus.\"\n\nmibypus: \"mibypus is cuzppus and popjpus.\"\n\ncuzppus: \"cuzppus is gorppus.\"\n\ngorppus: \"gorppus is hakypus.\"\n\nhakypus: \"hakypus is niyjpus.\"\n\nniyjpus: \"niyjpus is fatbpus and vavypus.\"\n\nfatbpus: \"fatbpus is haphpus.\"\n\nhaphpus: \"haphpus is hixzpus and xommpus.\"\n\nhixzpus: \"hixzpus is kelspus.\"\n\nkelspus: \"kelspus is dojspus and venlpus.\"\n\ndojspus: \"dojspus is vizcpus.\"\n\nvizcpus: \"vizcpus is nifkpus.\"\n\nnifkpus: \"nifkpus is subtpus.\"\n\nsubtpus: \"subtpus is paqvpus.\"\n\npaqvpus: \"paqvpus is boxzpus and huhkpus.\"\n\nboxzpus: \"boxzpus is hamfpus and negtpus and kiptpus.\"\n\nhamfpus: \"hamfpus is mickpus.\" and \"hamfpus is farcpus.\"\n\nmickpus: \"mickpus is kobdpus.\"\n\nkobdpus: \"kobdpus is faqbpus and wugfpus and lavspus.\"\n\nThis is getting very long, and I don't see babgpus or babkpus here. I need a better approach.\n\nI recall that I need babgpus and babkpus. From the given, babgpus is mentioned in \"fuwrpus is babgpus and sinspus.\" and babkpus is mentioned in \"pabkpus is babkpus and qemwpus and birvpus.\" and also \"konppus is pabkpus.\" so konppus belongs to pabkpus, which has babkpus.\n\nBut I need x to be babgpus and babkpus, meaning x belongs to both categories.\n\nSince x is dunmpus, and dunmpus is cancpus and biqhpus, let's see if cancpus leads to babgpus or babkpus.\n\ncancpus is hifbpus, and hifbpus is napnpus, napnpus is bevypus, etc. – that path seems unrelated to babgpus.\n\ncancpus is also refmpus: \"refmpus is nigmpus.\" but no link to babgpus.\n\nPerhaps from biqhpus? But biqhpus is not defined anywhere else, so I don't know what biqhpus is. Similarly, from pohppus, I have geyhpus and jupkpus, but neither seems to lead to babgpus or babkpus.\n\nAnother thought: x is pohppus, and pohppus is geyhpus and jupkpus, but geyhpus is fulcpus, and fulcpus is mewppus and bebgpus and zozdpus. bebgpus is not babgpus, so no babgpus.\n\nBut let's check if there is a connection elsewhere.\n\nI see that \"fuwrpus is babgpus and sinspus.\" and fuwrpus is related to nibbpus: \"nibbpus is fuwrpus.\" and hecdpus is nibbpus: \"hecdpus is nibbpus and kugqpus.\" and xiyrpus is hecdpus: \"xiyrpus is hecdpus.\" but xiyrpus is also savrpus and gipdpus, and xiyrpus is vakwpus? No, \"vakwpus is xiyrpus and doctpus.\" so vakwpus belongs to xiyrpus.\n\nBut x is not directly xiyrpus. x is pohppus and dunmpus.\n\nFrom dunmpus, cancpus is hifbpus, hifbpus is napnpus, napnpus is bevypus, bevypus is vocspus, etc. – no babgpus.\n\nPerhaps from another path.\n\nLet's list all statements that include babgpus or babkpus.\n\nbabgpus is only mentioned in \"fuwrpus is babgpus and sinspus.\" so to have x be babgpus, x must be fuwrpus or belong to something that belongs to fuwrpus, etc.\n\nSimilarly, babkpus is mentioned in \"pabkpus is babkpus and qemwpus and birvpus.\" so babkpus is a category that pabkpus belongs to, so for x to be babkpus, x must be pabkpus or belong to pabkpus.\n\nBut pabkpus is also mentioned in \"konppus is pabkpus.\" so konppus belongs to pabkpus.\n\nNow, is x related to konppus or pabkpus?\n\nFrom the given, I see \"jufnpus is konppus.\" so jufnpus belongs to konppus.\n\nAnd \"jufnpus is dokypus.\" so jufnpus belongs to dokypus.\n\nBut x is not directly jufnpus.\n\nx is dunmpus, and dunmpus is cancpus and biqhpus. cancpus is refmpus, etc., but no link to jufnpus.\n\nx is also pohppus, pohppus is geyhpus, geyhpus is fulcpus, fulcpus is mewppus, mewppus is loxfpus, loxfpus is vadqpus, vadqpus is xadhpus and kovspus, xadhpus is tagtpus, tagtpus is bixtpus, bixtpus is xopcpus and zosmpus, xopcpus is qulqpus, qulqpus is bewnpus and mugvpus, bewnpus is sogjpus, sogjpus is gurkpus, gurkpus is veznpus and sufkpus, veznpus is botfpus, botfpus is zefnpus and xilrpus, zefnpus is lughpus, lughpus is suczpus, suczpus is jicjpus, jicjpus is jebqpus, jebqpus is momqpus, momqpus is kutbpus and tubspus, kutbpus is yekmpus, yekmpus is lelkpus and zothpus and jegvpus, lelkpus is sobfpus and vedjpus, sobfpus is kegrpus and begtpus and cilxpus, kegrpus is hunfpus, hunfpus is naqdpus, naqdpus is lahkpus and navfpus, lahkpus is lodfpus, lodfpus is cidtpus and tadlpus, cidtpus is palspus, palspus is reflpus, reflpus is fadgpus and miwmpus, fadgpus is pazlpus, pazlpus is giwspus and zucjpus and rufwpus, giwspus is besxpus, besxpus is sucrpus, sucrpus is sifspus and zipppus, sifspus is kokwpus and also sifspus is tejrpus, tejrpus is waddpus, waddpus is mapvpus, mapvpus is mucwpus, mucwpus is tajxpus and pedbpus, tajxpus is parvpus and kikcpus and also tajxpus is fexjpus and ziqlpus, fexjpus is gelfpus, ziqlpus is lekhpus, lekhpus is xicspus, xicspus is xuqppus, xuqppus is jibgpus and qolppus, jibgpus is kavrpus and lejbpus, kavrpus is salrpus and xerjpus, salrpus is kavjpus, kavjpus is zufbpus, zufbpus is vakwpus, vakwpus is xiyrpus and doctpus, xiyrpus is savrpus and gipdpus and hecdpus and qowppus, hecdpus is nibbpus and kugqpus, nibbpus is fuwrpus, fuwrpus is babgpus and sinspus.\n\nFinally! So from this long chain, we see that fuwrpus is babgpus, and since nibbpus is fuwrpus, hecdpus is nibbpus, xiyrpus is hecdpus, vakwpus is xiyrpus, zufbpus is vakwpus, kavjpus is zufbpus, salrpus is kavjpus, kavrpus is salrpus, jibgpus is kavrpus, xuqppus is jibgpus, xicspus is xuqppus, lekhpus is xicspus, ziqlpus is lekhpus, tajxpus is ziqlpus, mucwpus is tajxpus, mapvpus is mucwpus, waddpus is mapvpus, tejrpus is waddpus, sifspus is tejrpus, sucrpus is sifspus, besxpus is sucrpus, giwspus is besxpus, pazlpus is giwspus, fadgpus is pazlpus, reflpus is fadgpus, palspus is reflpus, cidtpus is palspus, lodfpus is cidtpus, lahkpus is lodfpus, naqdpus is lahkpus, hunfpus is naqdpus, kegrpus is hunfpus, sobfpus is kegrpus, lelkpus is sobfpus, yekmpus is lelkpus, kutbpus is yekmpus, momqpus is kutbpus, jebqpus is momqpus, jicjpus is jebqpus, suczpus is jicjpus, lughpus is suczpus, zefnpus is lughpus, botfpus is zefnpus, veznpus is botfpus, gurkpus is veznpus, sogjpus is gurkpus, bewnpus is sogjpus, qulqpus is bewnpus, xopcpus is qulqpus, bixtpus is xopcpus, tagtpus is bixtpus, xadhpus is tagtpus, vadqpus is xadhpus, loxfpus is vadqpus, mewppus is loxfpus, fulcpus is mewppus, geyhpus is fulcpus, pohppus is geyhpus, and x is pohppus.\n\nTherefore, since x is pohppus, and through this chain, x eventually belongs to fuwrpus, which is babgpus. So x is babgpus.\n\nNow, we need to check if x is also babkpus.\n\nbabkpus is from pabkpus: \"pabkpus is babkpus and qemwpus and birvpus.\"\n\nAnd \"konppus is pabkpus.\" so konppus belongs to pabkpus.\n\nNow, we need to see if x belongs to konppus or pabkpus.\n\nFrom the given, we have \"jufnpus is konppus.\" so jufnpus belongs to konppus.\n\nAnd \"jufnpus is dokypus.\" so jufnpus belongs to dokypus.\n\nBut is x related to jufnpus?\n\nx is pohppus, and from above, we have a chain from pohppus to fuwrpus, but that doesn't include jufnpus.\n\nx is also dunmpus: \"x is dunmpus\"\n\ndunmpus is cancpus and biqhpus.\n\ncancpus is hifbpus and refmpus.\n\nhifbpus is napnpus.\n\nnapnpus is bevypus and vuzzpus.\n\nbevypus is vocspus and fanhpus and cayrpus.\n\nvocspus is xiwmpus and luzxpus.\n\nxiwmpus is johppus and gocmpus.\n\njohppus is wedtpus and tibtpus.\n\nwedtpus is licmpus.\n\nlicmpus is xubkpus.\n\nxubkpus is nidspus and derqpus.\n\nnidspus is yabjpus.\n\nyabjpus is mibypus and nejtpus.\n\nmibypus is cuzppus and popjpus.\n\ncuzppus is gorppus.\n\ngorppus is hakypus.\n\nhakypus is niyjpus.\n\nniyjpus is fatbpus and vavypus.\n\nfatbpus is haphpus.\n\nhaphpus is hixzpus and xommpus.\n\nhixzpus is kelspus.\n\nkelspus is dojspus and venlpus.\n\ndojspus is vizcpus.\n\nvizcpus is nifkpus.\n\nnifkpus is subtpus.\n\nsubtpus is paqvpus.\n\npaqvpus is boxzpus and huhkpus.\n\nboxzpus is hamfpus and negtpus and kiptpus.\n\nhamfpus is mickpus and farcpus.\n\nmickpus is kobdpus.\n\nkobdpus is faqbpus and wugfpus and lavspus.\n\nThis doesn't seem to lead to konppus or pabkpus.\n\nNow, cancpus is also refmpus: \"refmpus is nigmpus.\" but nigmpus is not defined, so probably no link.\n\nbiqhpus is not defined, so no help.\n\nFrom another path, x is pohppus, and we have the long chain to fuwrpus, but that doesn't include konppus.\n\nWe need to see if there is a connection from pohppus to konppus.\n\npohppus is also jupkpus, but jupkpus is not defined elsewhere, so no.\n\nPerhaps from dunmpus, but we already tried.\n\nAnother thing: from the given, we have \"majxpus is jufnpus and qogvpus and tawnpus.\" and \"tegppus is majxpus.\" and \"mazdpus is tegppus and dimzpus.\" and \"fenmpus is mazdpus.\" and \"zoxcpus is fenmpus and tuhkpus.\" and \"zuzxpus is zoxcpus.\" and \"nasdpus is zuzxpus and jikkpus.\" and \"farcpus is nasdpus.\" and \"hamfpus is farcpus.\" but from above, hamfpus is in boxzpus, which is in paqvpus, etc., but this is from cancpus path, which we have, but it doesn't lead to jufnpus directly.\n\nFrom hamfpus is farcpus, farcpus is nasdpus, nasdpus is zuzxpus and jikkpus, zuzxpus is zoxcpus, zoxcpus is fenmpus and tuhkpus, fenmpus is mazdpus, mazdpus is tegppus and dimzpus, tegppus is majxpus, majxpus is jufnpus and qogvpus and tawnpus, so majxpus belongs to jufnpus? No: \"majxpus is jufnpus\" means majxpus belongs to jufnpus? But from the statement, \"majxpus is jufnpus and qogvpus and tawnpus\" so majxpus belongs to jufnpus, meaning jufnpus is a category that contains majxpus.\n\nBut for x to be babkpus, x needs to be pabkpus or belong to pabkpus, and since konppus is pabkpus, if x belongs to konppus, then x belongs to pabkpus, thus babkpus.\n\nBut konppus is belongs to pabkpus, so if x belongs to konppus, then x belongs to pabkpus, which belongs to babkpus, so x belongs to babkpus.\n\nBut we need x to be babkpus, which means x belongs to babkpus, so yes, if x belongs to pabkpus, then since pabkpus belongs to babkpus, x belongs to babkpus.\n\nSimilarly, if x belongs to konppus, which belongs to pabkpus, which belongs to babkpus, so x belongs to babkpus.\n\nSo we need to see if x belongs to konppus.\n\nNow, konppus is mentioned in \"jufnpus is konppus\" which means jufnpus belongs to konppus? No, let's read carefully.\n\nIn this context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so \"jufnpus is konppus\" means jufnpus belongs to konppus. So konppus is a category that contains jufnpus.\n\nTherefore, for x to belong to konppus, x must be jufnpus or belong to something that belongs to konppus.\n\nBut from the statements, we have that majxpus belongs to jufnpus, so majxpus is in jufnpus, but jufnpus is in konppus, so majxpus is in konppus? Let's think about the hierarchy.\n\nIf jufnpus belongs to konppus, that means konppus is a broader category that includes jufnpus. So any thing that belongs to jufnpus also belongs to konppus, because belonging is transitive? In set theory, if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C, then A ⊆ C. Similarly here, if x belongs to jufnpus, and jufnpus belongs to konppus, then x belongs to konppus.\n\nBut in this context, \"A is B\" means A is an instance of B or A is contained in B, so yes, it should be transitive.\n\nSo if x belongs to jufnpus, then since jufnpus belongs to konppus, x belongs to konppus.\n\nThen since konppus belongs to pabkpus, x belongs to pabkpus, and since pabkpus belongs to babkpus, x belongs to babkpus.\n\nSo we need to see if x belongs to jufnpus.\n\nNow, from the given, is x related to jufnpus?\n\nx is dunmpus, and dunmpus is cancpus and biqhpus.\n\nWe need to see if cancpus or biqhpus leads to jufnpus.\n\nFrom cancpus, we have cancpus is hifbpus, etc., but we also have cancpus is refmpus, but refmpus is nigmpus, not helpful.\n\nFrom the other path, we have from hamfpus to majxpus as above.\n\nBut from cancpus, we have hamfpus? From earlier, from cancpus: cancpus is hifbpus, hifbpus is napnpus, napnpus is bevypus, bevypus is vocspus, vocspus is xiwmpus, xiwmpus is johppus, johppus is wedtpus, wedtpus is licmpus, licmpus is xubkpus, xubkpus is derqpus? Or nidspus? But let's see derqpus: \"derqpus is hulrpus and yijbpus.\" and hulrpus is voqhpus and also hulrpus is kiwmpus, etc., not sure.\n\nFrom xubkpus is derqpus, derqpus is hulrpus, hulrpus is voqhpus, voqhpus is hidtpus, etc., not leading to jufnpus.\n\nFrom xubkpus is nidspus, nidspus is yabjpus, etc., as before.\n\nBut from hamfpus, we have hamfpus is farcpus, which is from cancpus? cancpus is hifbpus, but hifbpus is napnpus, napnpus is bevypus, bevypus is vocspus, vocspus is xiwmpus, xiwmpus is johppus, johppus is wedtpus, wedtpus is licmpus, licmpus is xubkpus, xubkpus is derqpus? No, from licmpus is xubkpus, and xubkpus is nidspus and derqpus, but derqpus is hulrpus, and hulrpus is kiwmpus, kiwmpus is fanypus, etc., not hamfpus.\n\nhamfpus is in boxzpus: from subtpus is paqvpus, paqvpus is boxzpus, boxzpus is hamfpus, so from nifkpus is subtpus, nifkpus is vizcpus, vizcpus is dojspus, dojspus is kelspus, kelspus is hixzpus, hixzpus is haphpus, haphpus is fatbpus, fatbpus is niyjpus, niyjpus is hakypus, hakypus is gorppus, gorppus is cuzppus, cuzppus is mibypus, mibypus is yabjpus, yabjpus is nidspus, nidspus is xubkpus, xubkpus is licmpus, licmpus is wedtpus, wedtpus is johppus, johppus is xiwmpus, xiwmpus is vocspus, vocspus is bevypus, bevypus is napnpus, napnpus is hifbpus, hifbpus is cancpus, cancpus is dunmpus, and dunmpus is x? But x is dunmpus, so from this, x belongs to cancpus, which belongs to hifbpus, etc., down to hamfpus? Let's see: from bevypus to vocspus to xiwmpus to johppus to wedtpus to licmpus to xubkpus to nidspus to yabjpus to mibypus to cuzppus to gorppus to hakypus to niyjpus to fatbpus to haphpus to hixzpus to kelspus to dojspus to vizcpus to nifkpus to subtpus to paqvpus to boxzpus to hamfpus. So yes, eventually, from cancpus, we reach hamfpus.\n\nSo x belongs to cancpus, which belongs to hifbpus, ..., which belongs to boxzpus, which belongs to hamfpus? No: boxzpus is hamfpus and negtpus and kiptpus, so boxzpus belongs to hamfpus? Let's read: \"boxzpus is hamfpus and negtpus and kiptpus\" so boxzpus belongs to hamfpus? Or does it mean hamfpus is part of boxzpus? In the context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so \"boxzpus is hamfpus\" means boxzpus belongs to hamfpus. So hamfpus is a category that contains boxzpus.\n\nTherefore, from above, we have that x belongs to cancpus, which belongs to hifbpus, ... and so on, through the chain, we have that x belongs to paqvpus (since subtpus is paqvpus, and nifkpus is subtpus, etc., but let's see the direction.\n\nFrom x is dunmpus, dunmpus is cancpus, so x belongs to cancpus.\n\ncancpus is hifbpus, so x belongs to hifbpus.\n\nhifbpus is napnpus, so x belongs to napnpus.\n\nnapnpus is bevypus, so x belongs to bevypus.\n\nbevypus is vocspus, so x belongs to vocspus.\n\nvocspus is xiwmpus and luzxpus, so x belongs to xiwmpus.\n\nxiwmpus is johppus and gocmpus, so x belongs to johppus.\n\njohppus is wedtpus and tibtpus, so x belongs to wedtpus.\n\nwedtpus is licmpus, so x belongs to licmpus.\n\nlicmpus is xubkpus, so x belongs to xubkpus.\n\nxubkpus is nidspus and derqpus, so x belongs to nidspus (and derqpus, but we focus on nidspus).\n\nnidspus is yabjpus, so x belongs to yabjpus.\n\nyabjpus is mibypus and nejtpus, so x belongs to mibypus.\n\nmibypus is cuzppus and popjpus, so x belongs to cuzppus.\n\ncuzppus is gorppus, so x belongs to gorppus.\n\ngorppus is hakypus, so x belongs to hakypus.\n\nhakypus is niyjpus, so x belongs to niyjpus.\n\nniyjpus is fatbpus and vavypus, so x belongs to fatbpus.\n\nfatbpus is haphpus, so x belongs to haphpus.\n\nhaphpus is hixzpus and xommpus, so x belongs to hixzpus.\n\nhixzpus is kelspus, so x belongs to kelspus.\n\nkelspus is dojspus and venlpus, so x belongs to dojspus.\n\ndojspus is vizcpus, so x belongs to vizcpus.\n\nvizcpus is nifkpus, so x belongs to nifkpus.\n\nnifkpus is subtpus, so x belongs to subtpus.\n\nsubtpus is paqvpus, so x belongs to paqvpus.\n\npaqvpus is boxzpus and huhkpus, so x belongs to boxzpus.\n\nboxzpus is hamfpus and negtpus and kiptpus, so x belongs to hamfpus.\n\nTherefore, x belongs to hamfpus.\n\nNow, from hamfpus, we have \"hamfpus is farcpus\" so hamfpus belongs to farcpus? Or? \"hamfpus is farcpus\" means hamfpus belongs to farcpus? But earlier we have \"hamfpus is mickpus\" which means hamfpus belongs to mickpus? This seems confusing.\n\nLet's read the statements: \"hamfpus is mickpus.\" and \"hamfpus is farcpus.\" so according to the context, hamfpus belongs to both mickpus and farcpus. So mickpus and farcpus are categories that contain hamfpus.\n\nBut for our purpose, we need to get to jufnpus.\n\nFrom \"hamfpus is farcpus\" so x belongs to hamfpus, which belongs to farcpus, so x belongs to farcpus.\n\nNow, \"farcpus is nasdpus\" so farcpus belongs to nasdpus, so x belongs to nasdpus.\n\n\"nasdpus is zuzxpus and jikkpus\" so nasdpus belongs to zuzxpus, so x belongs to zuzxpus.\n\n\"zuzxpus is zoxcpus\" so zuzxpus belongs to zoxcpus, so x belongs to zoxcpus.\n\n\"zoxcpus is fenmpus and tuhkpus\" so zoxcpus belongs to fenmpus, so x belongs to fenmpus.\n\n\"fenmpus is mazdpus\" so fenmpus belongs to mazdpus, so x belongs to mazdpus.\n\n\"mazdpus is tegppus and dimzpus\" so mazdpus belongs to tegppus, so x belongs to tegppus.\n\n\"tegppus is majxpus\" so tegppus belongs to majxpus, so x belongs to majxpus.\n\n\"majxpus is jufnpus and qogvpus and tawnpus\" so majxpus belongs to jufnpus, so x belongs to jufnpus.\n\nTherefore, x belongs to jufnpus.\n\nNow, from \"jufnpus is konppus\" so jufnpus belongs to konppus, so since x belongs to jufnpus, x belongs to konppus.\n\nThen from \"konppus is pabkpus\" so konppus belongs to pabkpus, so x belongs to pabkpus.\n\nThen from \"pabkpus is babkpus and qemwpus and birvpus\" so pabkpus belongs to babkpus, so x belongs to babkpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babkpus.\n\nWe already have that x is babgpus from the first chain.\n\nSo x is both babgpus and babkpus.\n\nThus, the statement is true.\n\nSo to summarize: from x is pohppus, we derived that x is babgpus through the long chain involving fuwrpus.\n\nFrom x is dunmpus, we derived that x is babkpus through the chain involving hamfpus, farcpus, etc., to jufnpus, konppus, pabkpus.\n\nTherefore, it is true.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

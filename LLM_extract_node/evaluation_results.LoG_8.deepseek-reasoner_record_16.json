  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus. The given information says that x is baybpus. So, I have to trace what baybpus is and see if it connects to any of these categories.\n\nFrom the information: x is baybpus.\n\nNow, I need to find what baybpus is. Looking at the given statements:\n\nbaybpus is yisgpus and bodjpus.\n\nSo, baybpus belongs to yisgpus and bodjpus.

It means that hefppus is a subset of babbpus, but baybpus contains hefppus indirectly through many layers, so baybpus is a superset of hefppus, not a subset.\n\nLet's think about the direction.\n\nIf A is B, it means A belongs to B, so A is a member of B or a subset of B. So, B is a broader category.\n\nFor example, hefppus is babbpus, so hefppus ⊂ babbpus.\n\nmoptpus is hefppus, so moptpus ⊂ hefppus ⊂ babbpus.\n\nfuzgpus is moptpus, so fuzgpus ⊂ moptpus ⊂ hefppus ⊂ babbpus.\n\nAnd so on, down to baybpus, which contains all these, so baybpus is a superset of hefppus, but hefppus is a subset of babbpus, so baybpus is not necessarily a subset of babbpus; in fact, it might be a superset, so baybpus is not contained in babbpus.\n\nFor x to be babbpus, x must be contained in babbpus, but x is baybpus, which contains hefppus, which is contained in babbpus, so baybpus is not contained in babbpus; instead, babbpus contains hefppus, which is part of baybpus, but baybpus itself is not part of babbpus.\n\nTo make it clear: if babbpus is a category, and hefppus is in that category, then things that are in hefppus are also in babbpus, but baybpus is a category that contains hefppus, so baybpus is a larger category that includes hefppus, but baybpus is not itself in babbpus unless stated otherwise.\n\nFrom the relationships, there is no statement that baybpus is babbpus or anything like that. So, based on the given, baybpus is not directly or indirectly contained in babbpus.\n\nIn fact, from the chain, baybpus contains hefppus, which is in babbpus, so baybpus is not a subset of babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is baybpus, so x is not babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, babcpus and babppus are not mentioned at all, so definitely unknown.\n\nSo, for the question, x is not babbpus, and we don't know about babcpus or babppus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" so since x is not babbpus, and the others are unknown, the whole statement is false because it is not true that x is any of them.\n\nThe question is \"is it true or false or unknown that x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\"\n\nIf x is not babbpus and we don't know about the others, but since we don't know, it might be true if x is babcpus or babppus, but since they are not defined, it is unknown whether x is them.\n\nBut from the information, x is baybpus, and baybpus is not related to babcpus or babppus, so we cannot say that x is babcpus or babppus. So, it is false that x is babbpus, and unknown for the others, but since the statement is an OR, if one is true, the whole is true, but since none are true to our knowledge, it is false.\n\nBut we need to confirm if x could be babcpus or babppus.\n\nSince babcpus and babppus are not mentioned in any statement, there is no way to know if x is related to them. Therefore, it is unknown if x is babcpus or babppus.\n\nHowever, for the OR statement to be true, at least one must be true. Since we know x is not babbpus, and we don't know about the others, we cannot say the OR statement is true, but we also cannot say it is false because maybe x is babcpus. But in logic, if we don't know, we say unknown.\n\nBut in this context, since the information is complete from the given, and babcpus and babppus are not defined, we should assume that x is not them unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe note says that \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if there is no statement, then A does not belong to B.\n\nSo, for babcpus and babppus, since there is no statement that x is babcpus or anything like that, we can assume that x is not babcpus and not babppus.\n\nSimilarly, for babbpus, we have determined that x is not babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is not any of them, so the statement is false.\n\nTo be precise, let's see if there is any path to babcpus or babppus. Since they are not mentioned, no.\n\nSo, I think it is false.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any direct link to babbpus.\n\nFrom above, hefppus is babbpus, but hefppus is contained in baybpus through a long chain, so baybpus contains hefppus, so baybpus is not contained in babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is not babbpus.\n\nHence, the answer should be false.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" and since x is not babbpus and not the others, it is false.\n\nSo, I think that's it.",

It means that hefppus is a subset of babbpus, but baybpus contains hefppus indirectly through many layers, so baybpus is a superset of hefppus, not a subset.\n\nLet's think about the direction.\n\nIf A is B, it means A belongs to B, so A is a member of B or a subset of B. So, B is a broader category.\n\nFor example, hefppus is babbpus, so hefppus ⊂ babbpus.\n\nmoptpus is hefppus, so moptpus ⊂ hefppus ⊂ babbpus.\n\nfuzgpus is moptpus, so fuzgpus ⊂ moptpus ⊂ hefppus ⊂ babbpus.\n\nAnd so on, down to baybpus, which contains all these, so baybpus is a superset of hefppus, but hefppus is a subset of babbpus, so baybpus is not necessarily a subset of babbpus; in fact, it might be a superset, so baybpus is not contained in babbpus.\n\nFor x to be babbpus, x must be contained in babbpus, but x is baybpus, which contains hefppus, which is contained in babbpus, so baybpus is not contained in babbpus; instead, babbpus contains hefppus, which is part of baybpus, but baybpus itself is not part of babbpus.\n\nTo make it clear: if babbpus is a category, and hefppus is in that category, then things that are in hefppus are also in babbpus, but baybpus is a category that contains hefppus, so baybpus is a larger category that includes hefppus, but baybpus is not itself in babbpus unless stated otherwise.\n\nFrom the relationships, there is no statement that baybpus is babbpus or anything like that. So, based on the given, baybpus is not directly or indirectly contained in babbpus.\n\nIn fact, from the chain, baybpus contains hefppus, which is in babbpus, so baybpus is not a subset of babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is baybpus, so x is not babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, babcpus and babppus are not mentioned at all, so definitely unknown.\n\nSo, for the question, x is not babbpus, and we don't know about babcpus or babppus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" so since x is not babbpus, and the others are unknown, the whole statement is false because it is not true that x is any of them.\n\nThe question is \"is it true or false or unknown that x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\"\n\nIf x is not babbpus and we don't know about the others, but since we don't know, it might be true if x is babcpus or babppus, but since they are not defined, it is unknown whether x is them.\n\nBut from the information, x is baybpus, and baybpus is not related to babcpus or babppus, so we cannot say that x is babcpus or babppus. So, it is false that x is babbpus, and unknown for the others, but since the statement is an OR, if one is true, the whole is true, but since none are true to our knowledge, it is false.\n\nBut we need to confirm if x could be babcpus or babppus.\n\nSince babcpus and babppus are not mentioned in any statement, there is no way to know if x is related to them. Therefore, it is unknown if x is babcpus or babppus.\n\nHowever, for the OR statement to be true, at least one must be true. Since we know x is not babbpus, and we don't know about the others, we cannot say the OR statement is true, but we also cannot say it is false because maybe x is babcpus. But in logic, if we don't know, we say unknown.\n\nBut in this context, since the information is complete from the given, and babcpus and babppus are not defined, we should assume that x is not them unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe note says that \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if there is no statement, then A does not belong to B.\n\nSo, for babcpus and babppus, since there is no statement that x is babcpus or anything like that, we can assume that x is not babcpus and not babppus.\n\nSimilarly, for babbpus, we have determined that x is not babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is not any of them, so the statement is false.\n\nTo be precise, let's see if there is any path to babcpus or babppus. Since they are not mentioned, no.\n\nSo, I think it is false.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any direct link to babbpus.\n\nFrom above, hefppus is babbpus, but hefppus is contained in baybpus through a long chain, so baybpus contains hefppus, so baybpus is not contained in babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is not babbpus.\n\nHence, the answer should be false.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" and since x is not babbpus and not the others, it is false.\n\nSo, I think that's it.",

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Looking at the information, ravlpus is zivcpus and hiqspus. So, ravlpus contains zivcpus and hiqspus, but that doesn't directly tell me about babbpus.\n\nI need to find a chain from ravlpus to babbpus. Let me list out all the relationships.\n\nStart with x: x is ravlpus.\n\nravlpus is zivcpus and hiqspus. So, ravlpus includes zivcpus.\n\nzivcpus is lacfpus and buvkpus.

But this doesn't seem to lead to babbpus.\n\nI need to find babbpus. From the information, babbpus is mentioned in fujvpus: fujvpus is babbpus and tejjpus.\n\nAnd xemypus is fujvpus. But xemypus is also mentioned elsewhere.\n\nxemypus is ritlpus. And ritlpus is yodppus and zazcpus.\n\nBut I need to connect to x. x is ravlpus, and ravlpus is zivcpus, etc., but I don't see a direct link to xemypus or fujvpus from ravlpus.\n\nPerhaps I missed something. Let's see if ravlpus is connected to xemypus.\n\nFrom goxvpus: goxvpus is xemypus and cefspus and lewkpus.\n\nAnd qajjpus is goxvpus.\n\nBut qajjpus is not directly related to ravlpus.\n\nbiqkpus is wuvxpus, and wuvxpus is qajjpus, so biqkpus is wuvxpus which is qajjpus which is goxvpus which includes xemypus.\n\nBut piclpus is biqkpus, and piclpus is also vutqpus, but vutqpus is ziympus, which might not help.\n\nliwgpus is piclpus and cimnpus, and xihlpus is liwgpus, and jahwpus is xihlpus and sibvpus, and yajmpus is jahwpus, and bisjpus is yajmpus, and pikvpus is bisjpus, and muyfpus is pikvpus and pekzpus, and xajzpus is muyfpus, which we had earlier.\n\nBut for babbpus, we have fujvpus is babbpus and tejjpus, and xemypus is fujvpus.\n\nSo, xemypus includes babbpus.\n\nNow, is xemypus related to ravlpus? ravlpus is zivcpus and hiqspus. zivcpus is lacfpus and buvkpus. lacfpus is gewxpus and noxppus and juyzpus. gewxpus is meympus. meympus is damkpus. damkpus is hazvpus. hazvpus is daqgpus. daqgpus is nabfpus and patfpus. nabfpus is xajzpus and xondpus. xajzpus is gadjpus and palypus, and also muyfpus and kolnpus. muyfpus is pikvpus and pekzpus. pikvpus is bisjpus. bisjpus is yajmpus. yajmpus is jahwpus. jahwpus is xihlpus and sibvpus. xihlpus is liwgpus. liwgpus is piclpus and cimnpus. piclpus is biqkpus. biqkpus is wuvxpus. wuvxpus is qajjpus. qajjpus is goxvpus. goxvpus is xemypus and cefspus and lewkpus.\n\nSo, from xajzpus, we go through a long chain to goxvpus, which includes xemypus. Therefore, xajzpus includes xemypus indirectly.\n\nBut we have xajzpus from nabfpus, from daqgpus, from hazvpus, from damkpus, from meympus, from gewxpus, from lacfpus, from zivcpus, from ravlpus.\n\nSo, ravlpus includes zivcpus, which includes lacfpus, which includes gewxpus, which includes meympus, which includes damkpus, which includes hazvpus, which includes daqgpus, which includes nabfpus, which includes xajzpus, which includes muyfpus, but also through the chain, xajzpus leads to xemypus.\n\nSince xajzpus includes muyfpus, and muyfpus includes pikvpus, and so on, eventually to goxvpus and xemypus.\n\nTherefore, ravlpus includes xemypus through this long chain.\n\nAnd since xemypus includes fujvpus, and fujvpus includes babbpus, then ravlpus includes babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is ravlpus, so x includes babbpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus?\" which means is x contained in babbpus? Or is x a member of babbpus?\n\nFrom the reasoning, since x is ravlpus and ravlpus contains babbpus, that means babbpus is a subset or part of ravlpus, but not necessarily that ravlpus is part of babbpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus?\" which, based on the note, means x belongs to category babbpus, or x is contained in babbpus.\n\nBut from my reasoning, babbpus is contained in ravlpus, not the other way around.\n\nSo, for x to be babbpus, x would have to be a subset of babbpus, but here babbpus is a subset of ravlpus, so ravlpus is larger and contains babbpus, so x (which is ravlpus) is not contained in babbpus; instead, babbpus is contained in x.\n\nTherefore, x is not babbpus; rather, babbpus is part of x.\n\nSo, the statement \"x is babbpus\" is false.\n\nBut let me confirm.\n\nFrom the chain: x is ravlpus.\n\nravlpus contains zivcpus, which contains lacfpus, which contains gewxpus, which contains meympus, which contains damkpus, which contains hazvpus, which contains daqgpus, which contains nabfpus, which contains xajzpus.\n\nxajzpus contains muyfpus (from xajzpus is muyfpus and kolnpus).\n\nmuyfpus contains pikvpus (from muyfpus is pikvpus and pekzpus).\n\npikvpus contains bisjpus (from pikvpus is bisjpus).\n\nbisjpus contains yajmpus (from bisjpus is yajmpus).\n\nyajmpus contains jahwpus (from yajmpus is jahwpus).\n\njahwpus contains xihlpus (from jahwpus is xihlpus and sibvpus).\n\nxihlpus contains liwgpus (from xihlpus is liwgpus).\n\nliwgpus contains piclpus (from liwgpus is piclpus and cimnpus).\n\npiclpus contains biqkpus (from piclpus is biqkpus).\n\nbiqkpus contains wuvxpus (from biqkpus is wuvxpus).\n\nwuvxpus contains qajjpus (from wuvxpus is qajjpus).\n\nqajjpus contains goxvpus (from qajjpus is goxvpus).\n\ngoxvpus contains xemypus (from goxvpus is xemypus and cefspus and lewkpus).\n\nxemypus contains fujvpus (from xemypus is fujvpus).\n\nfujvpus contains babbpus (from fujvpus is babbpus and tejjpus).\n\nSo, indeed, ravlpus contains babbpus through this long chain of containments.\n\nTherefore, babbpus is contained within ravlpus, so ravlpus (which is x) is not contained within babbpus. Hence, x is not babbpus.\n\nThus, the statement is false.\n\nI should ensure there is no shorter path or other relationship.\n\nAlso, from the information, xemypus is directly mentioned as fujvpus, and also xemypus is ritlpus, but ritlpus is yodppus and zazcpus, which might not relate to babbpus directly.\n\nBut we have xemypus is fujvpus, so that's direct.\n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be false.",

Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

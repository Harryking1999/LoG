Let's read carefully:\n\nAfter \"zezhpus is vecmpus.\" the next is \"kudbpus is weckpus.\"? But in the text, it says: \"kudbpus is weckpus.\"? I think there might be a typo or I'm missing something.\n\nLet's look at the user's message: \"zezhpus is vecmpus. kudbpus is weckpus. lijwpus is zasgpus. zevfpus is fitmpus and yisbpus. gikfpus is babmpus and petrpus and reqypus and wamypus. qaztpus is jiycpus. lovjpus is kudbpus. jiycpus is gikfpus. zuwtpus is xubypus. wonmpus is zuwtpus and pigbpus and jubwpus. fuktpus is qaztpus. kudbpus is vowhpus. hisnpus is wonmpus. vadspus is lecspus. roqxpus is moxzpus and cozgpus. kajrpus is vadspus. vadspus is waqfpus. revxpus is veylpus. cipjpus is murppus and dighpus.\"\n\nSo, from this, I see \"kudbpus is weckpus\" and then later \"kudbpus is vowhpus\" which is confusing because it says kudbpus is two things? But according to the note, \"is\" means belongs to category, so it can belong to multiple categories, but here it might be that weckpus and vowhpus are categories, so kudbpus can be both, but let's see the context.\n\nActually, in the list, \"kudbpus is weckpus\" is stated, and then later \"kudbpus is vowhpus\" is also stated. So kudbpus belongs to weckpus and also to vowhpus? But that might be possible.\n\nBut in the chain, for lovjpus is kudbpus, and lovjpus is from nunppus, so for x, we need to see if it leads to babmpus.\n\nbabmpus is mentioned in gikfpus: \"gikfpus is babmpus and petrpus and reqypus and wamypus.\" so babmpus is a category that gikfpus belongs to.\n\nBut we need to see if x is babmpus or babbpus. babbpus is not mentioned anywhere in the information, so probably not, but let's see.\n\nFirst, let's trace x.\n\nx is kajrpus.\n\nkajrpus is vadspus. (from \"kajrpus is vadspus.\")\n\nvadspus is waqfpus. (from \"vadspus is waqfpus.\" but also \"vadspus is lecspus.\"? Let's see: \"vadspus is lecspus.\" is stated, but then \"vadspus is waqfpus.\" is also stated? So vadspus belongs to both lecspus and waqfpus? But from the chain, kajrpus is vadspus, so vadspus is a category, and it belongs to lecspus and waqfpus.\n\nBut for x, since x is kajrpus, and kajrpus is vadspus, so x is vadspus, which means x belongs to vadspus, but since vadspus belongs to lecspus and waqfpus, then x also belongs to lecspus and waqfpus? According to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if A is B and B is C, then A is C? The note doesn't explicitly say that, but in category relationships, if A is a member of B, and B is a subset of C, then A is a member of C. But here, \"B is C\" might mean that B is a category that is contained in C, so yes, transitive property should hold.\n\nSo, from x is kajrpus, kajrpus is vadspus, so x is vadspus.\n\nvadspus is lecspus and vadspus is waqfpus, so x is lecspus and x is waqfpus.\n\nNow, we need to see if x is babmpus or babbpus. babmpus is mentioned in gikfpus, so we need to see if x is gikfpus or something that leads to gikfpus.\n\nBut from above, x is waqfpus, and waqfpus is lenjpus and siwwpus. So x is lenjpus and x is siwwpus? Since waqfpus is lenjpus and siwwpus, meaning waqfpus belongs to both lenjpus and siwwpus, so since x is waqfpus, x belongs to lenjpus and siwwpus.\n\nSo x is lenjpus.\n\nlenjpus is laqnpus and rofrpus and wosdpus and gusdpus. So x is laqnpus, rofrpus, wosdpus, gusdpus.\n\nNow, laqnpus is yoqypus (from \"laqnpus is yoqypus\") and also laqnpus is cotbpus and zixnpus (from \"laqnpus is cotbpus and zixnpus\"). So laqnpus belongs to yoqypus, cotbpus, and zixnpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is laqnpus, x is yoqypus, x is cotbpus, x is zixnpus.\n\nNow, yoqypus is nunppus and nunspus. So x is nunppus and nunspus.\n\nnunppus is lovjpus. So x is lovjpus.\n\nlovjpus is kudbpus. So x is kudbpus.\n\nNow, kudbpus is weckpus? From the information: \"kudbpus is weckpus.\" and also \"kudbpus is vowhpus.\"? But we need to see if kudbpus leads to babmpus.\n\nBut from above, x is kudbpus, so x is weckpus and x is vowhpus? But weckpus and vowhpus are not directly related to babmpus.\n\nNow, we also have from earlier: lovjpus is kudbpus, and we have kudbpus is weckpus, but also later \"kudbpus is vowhpus\" is stated, so kudbpus belongs to vowhpus.\n\nBut vowhpus might not lead to babmpus.\n\nNow, where is babmpus? From \"gikfpus is babmpus and petrpus and reqypus and wamypus.\" so babmpus is a category that gikfpus belongs to, but we need to see if x is gikfpus or something that is gikfpus.\n\ngikfpus is mentioned in \"jiycpus is gikfpus\" and \"qaztpus is jiycpus\" and \"fuktpus is qaztpus\" and \"bodspus is fuktpus\" and \"moxzpus is bodspus\" and \"roqxpus is moxzpus and cozgpus\" and \"veylpus is roqxpus and wutypus\" and \"revxpus is veylpus\" and \"cardpus is revxpus and sujrpus\" and \"fezzpus is cardpus\" and \"zasgpus is fezzpus and tazypus\" and \"lijwpus is zasgpus\" and \"murppus is lijwpus\" and \"cipjpus is murppus and dighpus\" and \"fitmpus is cipjpus and hajdpus\" and \"zevfpus is fitmpus and yisbpus\" and \"vecmpus is zevfpus and bexfpus and legnpus\" and \"zezhpus is vecmpus\" and \"puzhpus is zezhpus\" and \"xubypus is puzhpus and ludgpus\" and \"zuwtpus is xubypus\" and \"wonmpus is zuwtpus and pigbpus and jubwpus\" and \"hisnpus is wonmpus\" and \"cotbpus is hisnpus and yollpus\" and since x is cotbpus, as we have earlier, x is cotbpus.\n\nSo let's see this chain.\n\nFrom above, x is cotbpus (from laqnpus is cotbpus, and x is laqnpus).\n\ncotbpus is hisnpus and yollpus.

So x is xubypus.\n\nxubypus is puzhpus and ludgpus. So x is puzhpus and x is ludgpus.\n\npuzhpus is zezhpus. So x is zezhpus.\n\nzezhpus is vecmpus. So x is vecmpus.\n\nvecmpus is zevfpus and bexfpus and legnpus. So x is zevfpus, x is bexfpus, x is legnpus.\n\nzevfpus is fitmpus and yisbpus. So x is fitmpus and x is yisbpus.\n\nfitmpus is cipjpus and hajdpus. So x is cipjpus and x is hajdpus.\n\ncipjpus is murppus and dighpus. So x is murppus and x is dighpus.\n\nmurppus is lijwpus. So x is lijwpus.\n\nlijwpus is zasgpus. So x is zasgpus.\n\nzasgpus is fezzpus and tazypus. So x is fezzpus and x is tazypus.\n\nfezzpus is cardpus. So x is cardpus.\n\ncardpus is revxpus and sujrpus. So x is revxpus and x is sujrpus.\n\nrevxpus is veylpus. So x is veylpus.\n\nveylpus is roqxpus and wutypus. So x is roqxpus and x is wutypus.\n\nroqxpus is moxzpus and cozgpus. So x is moxzpus and x is cozgpus.\n\nmoxzpus is bodspus. So x is bodspus.\n\nbodspus is fuktpus. So x is fuktpus.\n\nfuktpus is qaztpus. So x is qaztpus.\n\nqaztpus is jiycpus. So x is jiycpus.\n\njiycpus is gikfpus. So x is gikfpus.\n\nAnd finally, gikfpus is babmpus and petrpus and reqypus and wamypus.\n\nTherefore, since x is gikfpus, and gikfpus is babmpus, so x is babmpus.\n\nThe question is: is x is babbpus or babmpus? Since we have x is babmpus, it is true that x is babmpus.\n\nBut what about babbpus? babbpus is not mentioned anywhere in the information, so x is not babbpus. But the question is \"x is babbpus or babmpus?\" which is an OR condition. So if x is babmpus, then the OR is true.\n\nTherefore, it is true.\n\nBut let's confirm if we missed anything.\n\nWe have two chains: one from lenjpus to kudbpus, and another from cotbpus to gikfpus. And since x is both, we reached gikfpus.\n\nSo yes, x is babmpus.\n\nThus, the answer should be true.\n\nThe question says \"babbpus or babmpus\". Since babmpus is achieved, it is true.\n\nSo, final answer.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" â†’ \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" â†’ \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (â†’), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"Aâ†’Bâ†’Câ†’D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" â†’ \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" â†’ \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (â†’), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"Aâ†’Bâ†’Câ†’D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11.

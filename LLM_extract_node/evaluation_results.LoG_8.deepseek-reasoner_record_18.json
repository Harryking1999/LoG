  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is either babbpus or babcpus based on the given information. The information states that \"x is figfpus\", so I need to trace what figfpus is and see if it leads to babbpus or babcpus.\n\nFrom the given information:\n\n- x is figfpus\n\n- figfpus is tovzpus\n\nSo, x is tovzpus.\n\nNow, tovzpus is pecrpus\n\nSo, x is pecrpus.\n\npecrpus is kuclpus\n\nSo, x is kuclpus.\n\nkuclpus is dipgpus\n\nSo, x is dipgpus.\n\ndipgpus is yefjpus\n\nSo, x is yefjpus.\n\nyefjpus is kezfpus\n\nSo, x is kezfpus.\n\nkezfpus is ciwnpus\n\nSo, x is ciwnpus.\n\nciwnpus is gazspus\n\nSo, x is gazspus.\n\ngazspus is fupcpus and xiwhpus\n\nSince it says \"is\" with multiple things, it probably means that gazspus belongs to both fupcpus and xiwhpus, but I need to find a path to babbpus or babcpus.\n\nI should focus on babbpus. From the information, I see that wozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus. But I need to see if x connects to wozwpus or directly to babbpus.\n\nAlso, note that the question is about x being babbpus or babcpus. I don't see babcpus mentioned anywhere in the given information, so babcpus might be unknown. But I need to check for babbpus first.\n\nLet me list all the relations that might involve babbpus.\n\nFrom: wozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus.\n\nAnd jupvpus is wozwpus.\n\nAlso, norfpus is jupvpus and wulfpus.\n\nAnd norfpus is wutspus? Wait, no: redbpus is wutspus and natzpus, and wutspus is norfpus.\n\nLet's trace back from x.\n\nI have x is gazspus.\n\ngazspus is fupcpus and xiwhpus. I need to follow one of these.\n\nfupcpus is deqzpus\n\ndeqzpus is wijdpus and badlpus and kuttpus\n\nwijdpus is puxjpus\n\npuxjpus is nekjpus and nifzpus\n\nnekjpus is nogfpus\n\nnogfpus is visrpus and tokspus\n\nvisrpus is pibnpus\n\npibnpus is nopzpus and miympus\n\nnopzpus is fecppus\n\nfecppus is wurhpus and cogdpus and qutlpus\n\nwurhpus is pazzpus\n\npazzpus is hekhpus and wannpus\n\nhekhpus is maflpus\n\nmaflpus is yiytpus and vehppus\n\nyiytpus is beyfpus\n\nbeyfpus is wafhpus and yeftpus\n\nwafhpus is vashpus\n\nvashpus is wuvmpus\n\nwuvmpus is voqgpus\n\nvoqgpus is xaffpus and kojxpus\n\nxaffpus is rojmpus\n\nrojmpus is pijxpus and bovdpus and sijzpus\n\npijxpus is cikypus\n\ncikypus is lalwpus\n\nlalwpus is vopmpus\n\nvopmpus is wusjpus\n\nwusjpus is nijppus and liswpus\n\nBut also, wusjpus is vuchpus? From earlier: wusjpus is vuchpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom information: wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus. And also, vopmpus is wusjpus. But I also have: vuchpus is bibypus? No.\n\nFrom: wusjpus is vuchpus? Wait, I think I missed something.\n\nLet's look back at the given information:\n\n\"wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus.\" and \"vuchpus is bibypus.\" but also \"vopmpus is wusjpus\" and \"lalwpus is vopmpus\"\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus. This path seems long and might not lead to babbpus.\n\nI recall that norfpus is jupvpus and wulfpus, and jupvpus is wozwpus, and wozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus.\n\nSo, if I can connect x to norfpus, then I might get to babbpus.\n\nBut from x, I have x is gazspus, which is fupcpus, which is deqzpus, which has wijdpus, but wijdpus is puxjpus, etc. This path seems to be going elsewhere.\n\nI have another branch: gazspus is xiwhpus, but I don't see xiwhpus defined further, so I need to see if xiwhpus is connected to anything else. From the information, xiwhpus is not mentioned again, so perhaps I need to focus on fupcpus.\n\nBut let's think about norfpus. How is norfpus defined?\n\nFrom: wutspus is norfpus\n\nAnd redbpus is wutspus and natzpus\n\nAnd fuvlpus is redbpus\n\nAnd gizlpus is fuvlpus and nustpus\n\nAnd kexhpus is gizlpus\n\nAnd mefcpus is kisgpus and tavhpus, and kisgpus is kexhpus and coyrpus and vermpus.\n\nBut x is figfpus, which is tovzpus, etc., and I need to see if this connects to norfpus.\n\nFrom kuclpus is dipgpus, dipgpus is yefjpus, yefjpus is kezfpus, kezfpus is ciwnpus, ciwnpus is gazspus, gazspus is fupcpus, fupcpus is deqzpus, deqzpus is wijdpus and badlpus and kuttpus, wijdpus is puxjpus, puxjpus is nekjpus and nifzpus, nekjpus is nogfpus, nogfpus is visrpus and tokspus, visrpus is pibnpus, pibnpus is nopzpus and miympus, nopzpus is fecppus, fecppus is wurhpus and cogdpus and qutlpus, wurhpus is pazzpus, pazzpus is hekhpus and wannpus, hekhpus is maflpus, maflpus is yiytpus and vehppus, yiytpus is beyfpus, beyfpus is wafhpus and yeftpus, wafhpus is vashpus, vashpus is wuvmpus, wuvmpus is voqgpus, voqgpus is xaffpus and kojxpus, xaffpus is rojmpus, rojmpus is pijxpus and bovdpus and sijzpus, pijxpus is cikypus, cikypus is lalwpus, lalwpus is vopmpus, vopmpus is wusjpus, wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus.\n\nBut wusjpus is also mentioned in another place? From information: \"wusjpus is vuchpus\" ? Let's check the given information carefully.\n\nI see: \"vuchpus is bibypus\" and \"wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus\" but no direct link between wusjpus and vuchpus. However, I also have \"vopmpus is wusjpus\" and from lalwpus to vopmpus, but vuchpus is bibypus, which is katnpus, etc.\n\nThis is not leading to norfpus.\n\nI need to find a path to norfpus.\n\nnor fpus is from wutspus, and wutspus is from redbpus, and redbpus is from fuvlpus, and fuvlpus is from gizlpus, and gizlpus is from kexhpus, and kexhpus is from kisgpus, and kisgpus is from mefcpus, etc.\n\nBut x is from figfpus, which is tovzpus, tovzpus is pecrpus, pecrpus is kuclpus, kuclpus is dipgpus, dipgpus is yefjpus, yefjpus is kezfpus, kezfpus is ciwnpus, ciwnpus is gazspus, gazspus is fupcpus, fupcpus is deqzpus, deqzpus is wijdpus, etc. as above.\n\nBut from deqzpus, it has badlpus and kuttpus, which might be connected, but I don't see badlpus or kuttpus defined further, so probably not.\n\nPerhaps I missed something. Let's list all the relations that involve norfpus.\n\nFrom: norfpus is jupvpus and wulfpus\n\nAnd jupvpus is wozwpus\n\nwozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus\n\nAlso, norfpus is wutspus? No, wutspus is norfpus? Let's see: \"wutspus is norfpus\" from the information? Let's read.\n\nFrom given: \"redbpus is wutspus and natzpus\" and \"wutspus is norfpus\" so yes, wutspus is norfpus.\n\nAnd redbpus is from fuvlpus, because \"fuvlpus is redbpus\"\n\nAnd fuvlpus is from gizlpus, because \"gizlpus is fuvlpus and nustpus\"\n\nAnd gizlpus is from kexhpus, because \"kexhpus is gizlpus\"\n\nAnd kexhpus is from kisgpus, because \"kisgpus is kexhpus and coyrpus and vermpus\"\n\nAnd kisgpus is from mefcpus, because \"mefcpus is kisgpus and tavhpus\"\n\nBut mefcpus is also from fogdpus? Let's see: \"fogdpus is mefcpus and dofzpus\"\n\nAnd fogdpus is from xatwpus? \"xatwpus is fogdpus\" and \"ziprpus is xatwpus and suqvpus\" and \"vihdpus is vowlpus\" and \"fojhpus is vihdpus and vadxpus and xugvpus\" etc.\n\nBut for x, we have x is figfpus, which is tovzpus, and so on, but is there a connection between tovzpus and mefcpus?\n\ntovzpus is pecrpus, pecrpus is kuclpus, kuclpus is dipgpus, dipgpus is yefjpus, yefjpus is kezfpus, kezfpus is ciwnpus, ciwnpus is gazspus, gazspus is fupcpus, fupcpus is deqzpus, deqzpus is wijdpus, wijdpus is puxjpus, puxjpus is nekjpus, nekjpus is nogfpus, nogfpus is visrpus, visrpus is pibnpus, pibnpus is nopzpus, nopzpus is fecppus, fecppus is wurhpus, wurhpus is pazzpus, pazzpus is hekhpus, hekhpus is maflpus, maflpus is yiytpus, yiytpus is beyfpus, beyfpus is wafhpus, wafhpus is vashpus, vashpus is wuvmpus, wuvmpus is voqgpus, voqgpus is xaffpus, xaffpus is rojmpus, rojmpus is pijxpus, pijxpus is cikypus, cikypus is lalwpus, lalwpus is vopmpus, vopmpus is wusjpus, wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus.\n\nNow, wusjpus is also related to vuchpus? From information: \"vuchpus is bibypus\" and \"bibypus is katnpus\" and \"katnpus is luwxpus and cirypus\" and \"luwxpus is hismpus and hiqtpus\" and \"hismpus is bixjpus\" and \"bixjpus is xemypus and pavvpus\" and \"xemypus is jamnpus\" and \"jamnpus is duzvpus\" and \"duzvpus is dafvpus and gekypus and pekppus\" and \"dafvpus is rozfpus and dovkpus\" and \"rozfpus is votppus and juffpus and gufwpus and wenhpus\" and \"votppus is lelmpus\" and \"lelmpus is qijtpus\" and \"qijtpus is zomnpus\" and \"zomnpus is vojypus\" and \"vojypus is melspus\" and \"melspus is mukrpus and qopxpus\" and \"mukrpus is lazcpus and xipvpus\" and \"lazcpus is xiqhpus\" and \"xiqhpus is rinvpus\" and \"rinvpus is cunbpus\" and \"cunbpus is nupppus and nelrpus\" and \"nupppus is fojhpus and kuxbpus\" and \"fojhpus is vihdpus and vadxpus and xugvpus\" and \"vihdpus is vowlpus\" and \"vowlpus is ziprpus\" and \"ziprpus is xatwpus and suqvpus\" and \"xatwpus is fogdpus\" and \"fogdpus is mefcpus and dofzpus\" and \"mefcpus is kisgpus and tavhpus\" and so on.\n\nThis is very long, but notice that from wusjpus, we eventually reach mefcpus through this chain. But mefcpus is kisgpus, and kisgpus is kexhpus, and kexhpus is gizlpus, and gizlpus is fuvlpus, and fuvlpus is redbpus, and redbpus is wutspus, and wutspus is norfpus, and norfpus is jupvpus, and jupvpus is wozwpus, and wozwpus is babbpus.\n\nSo, theoretically, there is a path from wusjpus to babbpus.\n\nBut in the chain from x, we have x eventually reaching wusjpus through the long chain: x -> figfpus -> tovzpus -> pecrpus -> kuclpus -> dipgpus -> yefjpus -> kezfpus -> ciwnpus -> gazspus -> fupcpus -> deqzpus -> wijdpus -> puxjpus -> nekjpus -> nogfpus -> visrpus -> pibnpus -> nopzpus -> fecppus -> wurhpus -> pazzpus -> hekhpus -> maflpus -> yiytpus -> beyfpus -> wafhpus -> vashpus -> wuvmpus -> voqgpus -> xaffpus -> rojmpus -> pijxpus -> cikypus -> lalwpus -> vopmpus -> wusjpus.\n\nThen from wusjpus, as above, through vuchpus? But wait, in the chain from wusjpus to mefcpus, I need vuchpus? From information, vuchpus is bibypus, but how is vuchpus related to wusjpus? I don't see a direct link from wusjpus to vuchpus.\n\nIn the given information, it says: \"wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus\" but it does not say that wusjpus is vuchpus. However, later it says \"vuchpus is bibypus\" but no statement that wusjpus is vuchpus.\n\nBut in the chain I thought, from vopmpus is wusjpus, and lalwpus is vopmpus, etc., but for vuchpus, it is separate.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"vuchpus is bibypus\" and \"bibypus is katnpus\" etc., but how is vuchpus connected to wusjpus? I think I made a mistake.\n\nPerhaps from another angle. From the information, we have \"vopmpus is wusjpus\" and \"lalwpus is vopmpus\" but vuchpus is not directly related.\n\nBut in the long chain I described from wusjpus to mefcpus, it starts with vuchpus? No, let's see the chain from bibypus.\n\nbibypus is katnpus, katnpus is luwxpus and cirypus, luwxpus is hismpus and hiqtpus, hismpus is bixjpus, etc., but this is from bibypus, which is from vuchpus, but vuchpus is not connected to wusjpus in the given information.\n\nSo, how can I connect wusjpus to vuchpus? There is no statement that wusjpus is vuchpus or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the chain from x to wusjpus does not lead to vuchpus, and thus not to bibypus, etc.\n\nSo, from x, we have a path to wusjpus, but from wusjpus, we have only that it is nijppus and liswpus, which are not defined further, so we cannot reach norfpus from wusjpus directly.\n\nThus, x does not lead to babbpus through this path.\n\nBut earlier I thought about norfpus from redbpus, etc., but x is not connected to that chain.\n\nLet's see if x is connected to mefcpus through other means.\n\nFrom x is figfpus, figfpus is tovzpus, tovzpus is pecrpus, etc., but is there a shorter path?\n\nNotice that from pecrpus is kuclpus, kuclpus is dipgpus, dipgpus is yefjpus, yefjpus is kezfpus, kezfpus is ciwnpus, ciwnpus is gazspus, gazspus is fupcpus, fupcpus is deqzpus, deqzpus is wijdpus, wijdpus is puxjpus, puxjpus is nekjpus, nekjpus is nogfpus, nogfpus is visrpus, visrpus is pibnpus, pibnpus is nopzpus, nopzpus is fecppus, fecppus is wurhpus, wurhpus is pazzpus, pazzpus is hekhpus, hekhpus is maflpus, maflpus is yiytpus, yiytpus is beyfpus, beyfpus is wafhpus, wafhpus is vashpus, vashpus is wuvmpus, wuvmpus is voqgpus, voqgpus is xaffpus, xaffpus is rojmpus, rojmpus is pijxpus, pijxpus is cikypus, cikypus is lalwpus, lalwpus is vopmpus, vopmpus is wusjpus.\n\nNow, from wusjpus, what can we do? wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus, but nijppus and liswpus are not defined, so we stop here.\n\nSimilarly, from wusjpus, there is no link to vuchpus.\n\nBut from the information, we have \"vuchpus is bibypus\" and also \"wusjpus is vuchpus\"? Let's double-check the given information.\n\nI see: \"wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus.\" and separately \"vuchpus is bibypus.\" and also \"vopmpus is wusjpus\" but no \"wusjpus is vuchpus\" or \"vuchpus is wusjpus\".\n\nSo, unfortunately, wusjpus and vuchpus are not connected.\n\nTherefore, from x, we cannot reach vuchpus, nor norfpus, nor babbpus.\n\nBut what about other paths? Perhaps from gazspus is xiwhpus, but xiwhpus is not defined, so no help.\n\nAnother thing: from kezfpus is ciwnpus, but ciwnpus is gazspus, etc.\n\nPerhaps from dipgpus is yefjpus, but yefjpus is kezfpus, etc.\n\nMaybe from tovzpus is pecrpus, but pecrpus is kuclpus, etc.\n\nIs there any connection from x to something that leads to babbpus?\n\nLet's list all occurrences of babbpus. From \"wozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus\" so babbpus is only mentioned there.\n\nwozwpus is from jupvpus, because \"jupvpus is wozwpus\"\n\njupvpus is from norfpus, because \"norfpus is jupvpus and wulfpus\"\n\nnorfpus is from wutspus, because \"wutspus is norfpus\"\n\nwutspus is from redbpus, because \"redbpus is wutspus and natzpus\"\n\nredbpus is from fuvlpus, because \"fuvlpus is redbpus\"\n\nfuvlpus is from gizlpus, because \"gizlpus is fuvlpus and nustpus\"\n\ngizlpus is from kexhpus, because \"kexhpus is gizlpus\"\n\nkexhpus is from kisgpus, because \"kisgpus is kexhpus and coyrpus and vermpus\"\n\nkisgpus is from mefcpus, because \"mefcpus is kisgpus and tavhpus\"\n\nmefcpus is from fogdpus, because \"fogdpus is mefcpus and dofzpus\"\n\nfogdpus is from xatwpus, because \"xatwpus is fogdpus\"\n\nxatwpus is from ziprpus, because \"ziprpus is xatwpus and suqvpus\"\n\nziprpus is from vowlpus, because \"vowlpus is ziprpus\"\n\nvowlpus is from vihdpus, because \"vihdpus is vowlpus\"\n\nvihdpus is from fojhpus, because \"fojhpus is vihdpus and vadxpus and xugvpus\"\n\nfojhpus is from nupppus, because \"nupppus is fojhpus and kuxbpus\"\n\nnupppus is from cunbpus, because \"cunbpus is nupppus and nelrpus\"\n\ncunbpus is from rinvpus, because \"rinvpus is cunbpus\"\n\nrinvpus is from xiqhpus, because \"xiqhpus is rinvpus\"\n\nxiqhpus is from lazcpus, because \"lazcpus is xiqhpus\"\n\nlazcpus is from mukrpus, because \"mukrpus is lazcpus and xipvpus\"\n\nmukrpus is from melspus, because \"melspus is mukrpus and qopxpus\"\n\nmelspus is from vojypus, because \"vojypus is melspus\"\n\nvojypus is from zomnpus, because \"zomnpus is vojypus\"\n\nzomnpus is from qijtpus, because \"qijtpus is zomnpus\"\n\nqijtpus is from lelmpus, because \"lelmpus is qijtpus\"\n\nlelmpus is from votppus, because \"votppus is lelmpus\"\n\nvotppus is from rozfpus, because \"rozfpus is votppus and juffpus and gufwpus and wenhpus\"\n\nrozfpus is from dafvpus, because \"dafvpus is rozfpus and dovkpus\"\n\ndafvpus is from duzvpus, because \"duzvpus is dafvpus and gekypus and pekppus\"\n\nduzvpus is from jamnpus, because \"jamnpus is duzvpus\"\n\njamnpus is from xemypus, because \"xemypus is jamnpus\"\n\nxemypus is from bixjpus, because \"bixjpus is xemypus and pavvpus\"\n\nbixjpus is from hismpus, because \"hismpus is bixjpus\"\n\nhismpus is from luwxpus, because \"luwxpus is hismpus and hiqtpus\"\n\nluwxpus is from katnpus, because \"katnpus is luwxpus and cirypus\"\n\nkatnpus is from bibypus, because \"bibypus is katnpus\"\n\nbibypus is from vuchpus, because \"vuchpus is bibypus\"\n\nBut now, vuchpus is from where? Is there any statement that says what vuchpus is? From the information, we have \"vuchpus is bibypus\" but not what vuchpus is from. Similarly, we have \"wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus\" and also \"vopmpus is wusjpus\" but no link from vuchpus to wusjpus.\n\nSo, vuchpus is not connected to anything else? That can't be right because in the chain above, we have bibypus from vuchpus, but vuchpus itself is not defined as belonging to anything else.\n\nLet's read the given information again carefully.\n\nI see: \"vuchpus is bibypus\" but also, earlier, there is \"wusjpus is vuchpus\" ? Let's look at the initial given information.\n\nThe given information is: \"mefcpus is kisgpus and tavhpus. kexhpus is gizlpus. bixjpus is xemypus and pavvpus. xaffpus is rojmpus. fashpus is jiszpus and fomvpus. ciwnpus is gazspus. wuvmpus is voqgpus. pazzpus is hekhpus and wannpus. katnpus is luwxpus and cirypus. nopzpus is fecppus. dafvpus is rozfpus and dovkpus. rojmpus is pijxpus and bovdpus and sijzpus. zomnpus is vojypus. pijxpus is cikypus. xiqhpus is rinvpus. tovzpus is pecrpus. xemypus is jamnpus. nupppus is fojhpus and kuxbpus. xatwpus is fogdpus. vojypus is melspus. visrpus is pibnpus. bibypus is katnpus. jupvpus is wozwpus. wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus. hismpus is bixjpus. puxjpus is nekjpus and nifzpus. dipgpus is yefjpus. fuvlpus is redbpus. beyfpus is wafhpus and yeftpus. voqgpus is xaffpus and kojxpus. kezfpus is ciwnpus. nekjpus is nogfpus. yiytpus is beyfpus. maflpus is yiytpus and vehppus. mukrpus is lazcpus and xipvpus. vopmpus is wusjpus. redbpus is wutspus and natzpus. cikypus is lalwpus. fojhpus is vihdpus and vadxpus and xugvpus. wutspus is norfpus. lazcpus is xiqhpus. wurhpus is pazzpus. vashpus is wuvmpus. x is figfpus. wozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus. yefjpus is kezfpus. gazspus is fupcpus and xiwhpus. rozfpus is votppus and juffpus and gufwpus and wenhpus. qijtpus is zomnpus. nogfpus is visrpus and tokspus. wafhpus is vashpus. wusjpus is vuchpus. cunbpus is nupppus and nelrpus. deqzpus is wijdpus and badlpus and kuttpus. duzvpus is dafvpus and gekypus and pekppus. melspus is mukrpus and qopxpus. kisgpus is kexhpus and coyrpus and vermpus. pecrpus is kuclpus. wijdpus is puxjpus. ziprpus is xatwpus and suqvpus. wuvmpus is qonzpus. gizlpus is fuvlpus and nustpus. luwxpus is hismpus and hiqtpus. jamnpus is duzvpus. fupcpus is deqzpus. pibnpus is nopzpus and miympus. fecppus is wurhpus and cogdpus and qutlpus. votppus is lelmpus. vuchpus is bibypus. rinvpus is cunbpus. lelmpus is qijtpus. vowlpus is ziprpus. fogdpus is mefcpus and dofzpus. kuclpus is dipgpus. figfpus is tovzpus. yiytpus is fashpus. norfpus is jupvpus and wulfpus. vihdpus is vowlpus. lalwpus is vopmpus. hekhpus is maflpus. \"\n\nAh!

Yes, towards the end, it says \"wusjpus is vuchpus\" after all.\n\nSo, from \"wusjpus is vuchpus\" and \"vuchpus is bibypus\" so wusjpus is vuchpus, and vuchpus is bibypus, so wusjpus is bibypus.\n\nTherefore, from the chain above, from x to wusjpus, we have wusjpus is bibypus.\n\nAnd from bibypus is katnpus, etc., as in the long chain, eventually to mefcpus, and then to kisgpus, kexhpus, gizlpus, fuvlpus, redbpus, wutspus, norfpus, jupvpus, wozwpus, and wozwpus is babbpus.\n\nSo, yes, there is a path from x to babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus.\n\nNow, the question is whether x is babbpus or babcpus. Since babcpus is not mentioned anywhere, it is unknown if x is babcpus, but since x is babbpus, it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nThe question says: \"Is it true or false or unknown: x is babbpus or babcpus?\"\n\nSince x is babbpus, then \"x is babbpus or babcpus\" is true because one of the conditions is true.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nTo confirm, let's outline the path briefly.\n\nx is figfpus\n\nfigfpus is tovzpus\n\ntovzpus is pecrpus\n\npecrpus is kuclpus\n\nkuclpus is dipgpus\n\ndipgpus is yefjpus\n\nyefjpus is kezfpus\n\nkezfpus is ciwnpus\n\nciwnpus is gazspus\n\ngazspus is fupcpus\n\nfupcpus is deqzpus\n\ndeqzpus is wijdpus\n\nwijdpus is puxjpus\n\npuxjpus is nekjpus\n\nnekjpus is nogfpus\n\nnogfpus is visrpus\n\nvisrpus is pibnpus\n\npibnpus is nopzpus\n\nnopzpus is fecppus\n\nfecppus is wurhpus\n\nwurhpus is pazzpus\n\npazzpus is hekhpus\n\nhekhpus is maflpus\n\nmaflpus is yiytpus\n\nyiytpus is beyfpus\n\nbeyfpus is wafhpus\n\nwafhpus is vashpus\n\nvashpus is wuvmpus\n\nwuvmpus is voqgpus\n\nvoqgpus is xaffpus\n\nxaffpus is rojmpus\n\nrojmpus is pijxpus\n\npijxpus is cikypus\n\ncikypus is lalwpus\n\nlalwpus is vopmpus\n\nvopmpus is wusjpus\n\nwusjpus is vuchpus  (from \"wusjpus is vuchpus\")\n\nvuchpus is bibypus\n\nbibypus is katnpus\n\nkatnpus is luwxpus and cirypus\n\nluwxpus is hismpus and hiqtpus\n\nhismpus is bixjpus\n\nbixjpus is xemypus and pavvpus\n\nxemypus is jamnpus\n\njamnpus is duzvpus\n\nduzvpus is dafvpus and gekypus and pekppus\n\ndafvpus is rozfpus and dovkpus\n\nrozfpus is votppus and juffpus and gufwpus and wenhpus\n\nvotppus is lelmpus\n\nlelmpus is qijtpus\n\nqijtpus is zomnpus\n\nzomnpus is vojypus\n\nvojypus is melspus\n\nmelspus is mukrpus and qopxpus\n\nmukrpus is lazcpus and xipvpus\n\nlazcpus is xiqhpus\n\nxiqhpus is rinvpus\n\nrinvpus is cunbpus\n\ncunbpus is nupppus and nelrpus\n\nnupppus is fojhpus and kuxbpus\n\nfojhpus is vihdpus and vadxpus and xugvpus\n\nvihdpus is vowlpus\n\nvowlpus is ziprpus\n\nziprpus is xatwpus and suqvpus\n\nxatwpus is fogdpus\n\nfogdpus is mefcpus and dofzpus\n\nmefcpus is kisgpus and tavhpus\n\nkisgpus is kexhpus and coyrpus and vermpus\n\nkexhpus is gizlpus\n\ngizlpus is fuvlpus and nustpus\n\nfuvlpus is redbpus\n\nredbpus is wutspus and natzpus\n\nwutspus is norfpus\n\nnorfpus is jupvpus and wulfpus\n\njupvpus is wozwpus\n\nwozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus\n\nThus, x is babbpus.\n\nSo, for the question, x is babbpus, so \"x is babbpus or babcpus\" is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is true.",
  "thinking_text": "First, I need to determine if x is either babbpus or babcpus based on the given information. The information states that \"x is figfpus\", so I need to trace what figfpus is and see if it leads to babbpus or babcpus.\n\nFrom the given information:\n\n- x is figfpus\n\n- figfpus is tovzpus\n\nSo, x is tovzpus.\n\nNow, tovzpus is pecrpus\n\nSo, x is pecrpus.\n\npecrpus is kuclpus\n\nSo, x is kuclpus.\n\nkuclpus is dipgpus\n\nSo, x is dipgpus.\n\ndipgpus is yefjpus\n\nSo, x is yefjpus.\n\nyefjpus is kezfpus\n\nSo, x is kezfpus.\n\nkezfpus is ciwnpus\n\nSo, x is ciwnpus.\n\nciwnpus is gazspus\n\nSo, x is gazspus.\n\ngazspus is fupcpus and xiwhpus\n\nSince it says \"is\" with multiple things, it probably means that gazspus belongs to both fupcpus and xiwhpus, but I need to find a path to babbpus or babcpus.\n\nI should focus on babbpus. From the information, I see that wozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus. But I need to see if x connects to wozwpus or directly to babbpus.\n\nAlso, note that the question is about x being babbpus or babcpus. I don't see babcpus mentioned anywhere in the given information, so babcpus might be unknown. But I need to check for babbpus first.\n\nLet me list all the relations that might involve babbpus.\n\nFrom: wozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus.\n\nAnd jupvpus is wozwpus.\n\nAlso, norfpus is jupvpus and wulfpus.\n\nAnd norfpus is wutspus?

From earlier: wusjpus is vuchpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom information: wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus. And also, vopmpus is wusjpus. But I also have: vuchpus is bibypus? No.\n\nFrom: wusjpus is vuchpus? Wait, I think I missed something.\n\nLet's look back at the given information:\n\n\"wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus.\" and \"vuchpus is bibypus.\" but also \"vopmpus is wusjpus\" and \"lalwpus is vopmpus\"\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus. This path seems long and might not lead to babbpus.\n\nI recall that norfpus is jupvpus and wulfpus, and jupvpus is wozwpus, and wozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus.\n\nSo, if I can connect x to norfpus, then I might get to babbpus.\n\nBut from x, I have x is gazspus, which is fupcpus, which is deqzpus, which has wijdpus, but wijdpus is puxjpus, etc. This path seems to be going elsewhere.\n\nI have another branch: gazspus is xiwhpus, but I don't see xiwhpus defined further, so I need to see if xiwhpus is connected to anything else. From the information, xiwhpus is not mentioned again, so perhaps I need to focus on fupcpus.\n\nBut let's think about norfpus. How is norfpus defined?\n\nFrom: wutspus is norfpus\n\nAnd redbpus is wutspus and natzpus\n\nAnd fuvlpus is redbpus\n\nAnd gizlpus is fuvlpus and nustpus\n\nAnd kexhpus is gizlpus\n\nAnd mefcpus is kisgpus and tavhpus, and kisgpus is kexhpus and coyrpus and vermpus.\n\nBut x is figfpus, which is tovzpus, etc., and I need to see if this connects to norfpus.\n\nFrom kuclpus is dipgpus, dipgpus is yefjpus, yefjpus is kezfpus, kezfpus is ciwnpus, ciwnpus is gazspus, gazspus is fupcpus, fupcpus is deqzpus, deqzpus is wijdpus and badlpus and kuttpus, wijdpus is puxjpus, puxjpus is nekjpus and nifzpus, nekjpus is nogfpus, nogfpus is visrpus and tokspus, visrpus is pibnpus, pibnpus is nopzpus and miympus, nopzpus is fecppus, fecppus is wurhpus and cogdpus and qutlpus, wurhpus is pazzpus, pazzpus is hekhpus and wannpus, hekhpus is maflpus, maflpus is yiytpus and vehppus, yiytpus is beyfpus, beyfpus is wafhpus and yeftpus, wafhpus is vashpus, vashpus is wuvmpus, wuvmpus is voqgpus, voqgpus is xaffpus and kojxpus, xaffpus is rojmpus, rojmpus is pijxpus and bovdpus and sijzpus, pijxpus is cikypus, cikypus is lalwpus, lalwpus is vopmpus, vopmpus is wusjpus, wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus.\n\nBut wusjpus is also mentioned in another place? From information: \"wusjpus is vuchpus\" ? Let's check the given information carefully.\n\nI see: \"vuchpus is bibypus\" and \"wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus\" but no direct link between wusjpus and vuchpus. However, I also have \"vopmpus is wusjpus\" and from lalwpus to vopmpus, but vuchpus is bibypus, which is katnpus, etc.\n\nThis is not leading to norfpus.\n\nI need to find a path to norfpus.\n\nnor fpus is from wutspus, and wutspus is from redbpus, and redbpus is from fuvlpus, and fuvlpus is from gizlpus, and gizlpus is from kexhpus, and kexhpus is from kisgpus, and kisgpus is from mefcpus, etc.\n\nBut x is from figfpus, which is tovzpus, tovzpus is pecrpus, pecrpus is kuclpus, kuclpus is dipgpus, dipgpus is yefjpus, yefjpus is kezfpus, kezfpus is ciwnpus, ciwnpus is gazspus, gazspus is fupcpus, fupcpus is deqzpus, deqzpus is wijdpus, etc. as above.\n\nBut from deqzpus, it has badlpus and kuttpus, which might be connected, but I don't see badlpus or kuttpus defined further, so probably not.\n\nPerhaps I missed something. Let's list all the relations that involve norfpus.\n\nFrom: norfpus is jupvpus and wulfpus\n\nAnd jupvpus is wozwpus\n\nwozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus\n\nAlso, norfpus is wutspus? No, wutspus is norfpus? Let's see: \"wutspus is norfpus\" from the information? Let's read.\n\nFrom given: \"redbpus is wutspus and natzpus\" and \"wutspus is norfpus\" so yes, wutspus is norfpus.\n\nAnd redbpus is from fuvlpus, because \"fuvlpus is redbpus\"\n\nAnd fuvlpus is from gizlpus, because \"gizlpus is fuvlpus and nustpus\"\n\nAnd gizlpus is from kexhpus, because \"kexhpus is gizlpus\"\n\nAnd kexhpus is from kisgpus, because \"kisgpus is kexhpus and coyrpus and vermpus\"\n\nAnd kisgpus is from mefcpus, because \"mefcpus is kisgpus and tavhpus\"\n\nBut mefcpus is also from fogdpus? Let's see: \"fogdpus is mefcpus and dofzpus\"\n\nAnd fogdpus is from xatwpus? \"xatwpus is fogdpus\" and \"ziprpus is xatwpus and suqvpus\" and \"vihdpus is vowlpus\" and \"fojhpus is vihdpus and vadxpus and xugvpus\" etc.\n\nBut for x, we have x is figfpus, which is tovzpus, and so on, but is there a connection between tovzpus and mefcpus?\n\ntovzpus is pecrpus, pecrpus is kuclpus, kuclpus is dipgpus, dipgpus is yefjpus, yefjpus is kezfpus, kezfpus is ciwnpus, ciwnpus is gazspus, gazspus is fupcpus, fupcpus is deqzpus, deqzpus is wijdpus, wijdpus is puxjpus, puxjpus is nekjpus, nekjpus is nogfpus, nogfpus is visrpus, visrpus is pibnpus, pibnpus is nopzpus, nopzpus is fecppus, fecppus is wurhpus, wurhpus is pazzpus, pazzpus is hekhpus, hekhpus is maflpus, maflpus is yiytpus, yiytpus is beyfpus, beyfpus is wafhpus, wafhpus is vashpus, vashpus is wuvmpus, wuvmpus is voqgpus, voqgpus is xaffpus, xaffpus is rojmpus, rojmpus is pijxpus, pijxpus is cikypus, cikypus is lalwpus, lalwpus is vopmpus, vopmpus is wusjpus, wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus.\n\nNow, wusjpus is also related to vuchpus? From information: \"vuchpus is bibypus\" and \"bibypus is katnpus\" and \"katnpus is luwxpus and cirypus\" and \"luwxpus is hismpus and hiqtpus\" and \"hismpus is bixjpus\" and \"bixjpus is xemypus and pavvpus\" and \"xemypus is jamnpus\" and \"jamnpus is duzvpus\" and \"duzvpus is dafvpus and gekypus and pekppus\" and \"dafvpus is rozfpus and dovkpus\" and \"rozfpus is votppus and juffpus and gufwpus and wenhpus\" and \"votppus is lelmpus\" and \"lelmpus is qijtpus\" and \"qijtpus is zomnpus\" and \"zomnpus is vojypus\" and \"vojypus is melspus\" and \"melspus is mukrpus and qopxpus\" and \"mukrpus is lazcpus and xipvpus\" and \"lazcpus is xiqhpus\" and \"xiqhpus is rinvpus\" and \"rinvpus is cunbpus\" and \"cunbpus is nupppus and nelrpus\" and \"nupppus is fojhpus and kuxbpus\" and \"fojhpus is vihdpus and vadxpus and xugvpus\" and \"vihdpus is vowlpus\" and \"vowlpus is ziprpus\" and \"ziprpus is xatwpus and suqvpus\" and \"xatwpus is fogdpus\" and \"fogdpus is mefcpus and dofzpus\" and \"mefcpus is kisgpus and tavhpus\" and so on.\n\nThis is very long, but notice that from wusjpus, we eventually reach mefcpus through this chain. But mefcpus is kisgpus, and kisgpus is kexhpus, and kexhpus is gizlpus, and gizlpus is fuvlpus, and fuvlpus is redbpus, and redbpus is wutspus, and wutspus is norfpus, and norfpus is jupvpus, and jupvpus is wozwpus, and wozwpus is babbpus.\n\nSo, theoretically, there is a path from wusjpus to babbpus.\n\nBut in the chain from x, we have x eventually reaching wusjpus through the long chain: x -> figfpus -> tovzpus -> pecrpus -> kuclpus -> dipgpus -> yefjpus -> kezfpus -> ciwnpus -> gazspus -> fupcpus -> deqzpus -> wijdpus -> puxjpus -> nekjpus -> nogfpus -> visrpus -> pibnpus -> nopzpus -> fecppus -> wurhpus -> pazzpus -> hekhpus -> maflpus -> yiytpus -> beyfpus -> wafhpus -> vashpus -> wuvmpus -> voqgpus -> xaffpus -> rojmpus -> pijxpus -> cikypus -> lalwpus -> vopmpus -> wusjpus.\n\nThen from wusjpus, as above, through vuchpus? But wait, in the chain from wusjpus to mefcpus, I need vuchpus? From information, vuchpus is bibypus, but how is vuchpus related to wusjpus? I don't see a direct link from wusjpus to vuchpus.\n\nIn the given information, it says: \"wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus\" but it does not say that wusjpus is vuchpus. However, later it says \"vuchpus is bibypus\" but no statement that wusjpus is vuchpus.\n\nBut in the chain I thought, from vopmpus is wusjpus, and lalwpus is vopmpus, etc., but for vuchpus, it is separate.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"vuchpus is bibypus\" and \"bibypus is katnpus\" etc., but how is vuchpus connected to wusjpus? I think I made a mistake.\n\nPerhaps from another angle. From the information, we have \"vopmpus is wusjpus\" and \"lalwpus is vopmpus\" but vuchpus is not directly related.\n\nBut in the long chain I described from wusjpus to mefcpus, it starts with vuchpus? No, let's see the chain from bibypus.\n\nbibypus is katnpus, katnpus is luwxpus and cirypus, luwxpus is hismpus and hiqtpus, hismpus is bixjpus, etc., but this is from bibypus, which is from vuchpus, but vuchpus is not connected to wusjpus in the given information.\n\nSo, how can I connect wusjpus to vuchpus? There is no statement that wusjpus is vuchpus or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the chain from x to wusjpus does not lead to vuchpus, and thus not to bibypus, etc.\n\nSo, from x, we have a path to wusjpus, but from wusjpus, we have only that it is nijppus and liswpus, which are not defined further, so we cannot reach norfpus from wusjpus directly.\n\nThus, x does not lead to babbpus through this path.\n\nBut earlier I thought about norfpus from redbpus, etc., but x is not connected to that chain.\n\nLet's see if x is connected to mefcpus through other means.\n\nFrom x is figfpus, figfpus is tovzpus, tovzpus is pecrpus, etc., but is there a shorter path?\n\nNotice that from pecrpus is kuclpus, kuclpus is dipgpus, dipgpus is yefjpus, yefjpus is kezfpus, kezfpus is ciwnpus, ciwnpus is gazspus, gazspus is fupcpus, fupcpus is deqzpus, deqzpus is wijdpus, wijdpus is puxjpus, puxjpus is nekjpus, nekjpus is nogfpus, nogfpus is visrpus, visrpus is pibnpus, pibnpus is nopzpus, nopzpus is fecppus, fecppus is wurhpus, wurhpus is pazzpus, pazzpus is hekhpus, hekhpus is maflpus, maflpus is yiytpus, yiytpus is beyfpus, beyfpus is wafhpus, wafhpus is vashpus, vashpus is wuvmpus, wuvmpus is voqgpus, voqgpus is xaffpus, xaffpus is rojmpus, rojmpus is pijxpus, pijxpus is cikypus, cikypus is lalwpus, lalwpus is vopmpus, vopmpus is wusjpus.\n\nNow, from wusjpus, what can we do? wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus, but nijppus and liswpus are not defined, so we stop here.\n\nSimilarly, from wusjpus, there is no link to vuchpus.\n\nBut from the information, we have \"vuchpus is bibypus\" and also \"wusjpus is vuchpus\"? Let's double-check the given information.\n\nI see: \"wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus.\" and separately \"vuchpus is bibypus.\" and also \"vopmpus is wusjpus\" but no \"wusjpus is vuchpus\" or \"vuchpus is wusjpus\".\n\nSo, unfortunately, wusjpus and vuchpus are not connected.\n\nTherefore, from x, we cannot reach vuchpus, nor norfpus, nor babbpus.\n\nBut what about other paths? Perhaps from gazspus is xiwhpus, but xiwhpus is not defined, so no help.\n\nAnother thing: from kezfpus is ciwnpus, but ciwnpus is gazspus, etc.\n\nPerhaps from dipgpus is yefjpus, but yefjpus is kezfpus, etc.\n\nMaybe from tovzpus is pecrpus, but pecrpus is kuclpus, etc.\n\nIs there any connection from x to something that leads to babbpus?\n\nLet's list all occurrences of babbpus. From \"wozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus\" so babbpus is only mentioned there.\n\nwozwpus is from jupvpus, because \"jupvpus is wozwpus\"\n\njupvpus is from norfpus, because \"norfpus is jupvpus and wulfpus\"\n\nnorfpus is from wutspus, because \"wutspus is norfpus\"\n\nwutspus is from redbpus, because \"redbpus is wutspus and natzpus\"\n\nredbpus is from fuvlpus, because \"fuvlpus is redbpus\"\n\nfuvlpus is from gizlpus, because \"gizlpus is fuvlpus and nustpus\"\n\ngizlpus is from kexhpus, because \"kexhpus is gizlpus\"\n\nkexhpus is from kisgpus, because \"kisgpus is kexhpus and coyrpus and vermpus\"\n\nkisgpus is from mefcpus, because \"mefcpus is kisgpus and tavhpus\"\n\nmefcpus is from fogdpus, because \"fogdpus is mefcpus and dofzpus\"\n\nfogdpus is from xatwpus, because \"xatwpus is fogdpus\"\n\nxatwpus is from ziprpus, because \"ziprpus is xatwpus and suqvpus\"\n\nziprpus is from vowlpus, because \"vowlpus is ziprpus\"\n\nvowlpus is from vihdpus, because \"vihdpus is vowlpus\"\n\nvihdpus is from fojhpus, because \"fojhpus is vihdpus and vadxpus and xugvpus\"\n\nfojhpus is from nupppus, because \"nupppus is fojhpus and kuxbpus\"\n\nnupppus is from cunbpus, because \"cunbpus is nupppus and nelrpus\"\n\ncunbpus is from rinvpus, because \"rinvpus is cunbpus\"\n\nrinvpus is from xiqhpus, because \"xiqhpus is rinvpus\"\n\nxiqhpus is from lazcpus, because \"lazcpus is xiqhpus\"\n\nlazcpus is from mukrpus, because \"mukrpus is lazcpus and xipvpus\"\n\nmukrpus is from melspus, because \"melspus is mukrpus and qopxpus\"\n\nmelspus is from vojypus, because \"vojypus is melspus\"\n\nvojypus is from zomnpus, because \"zomnpus is vojypus\"\n\nzomnpus is from qijtpus, because \"qijtpus is zomnpus\"\n\nqijtpus is from lelmpus, because \"lelmpus is qijtpus\"\n\nlelmpus is from votppus, because \"votppus is lelmpus\"\n\nvotppus is from rozfpus, because \"rozfpus is votppus and juffpus and gufwpus and wenhpus\"\n\nrozfpus is from dafvpus, because \"dafvpus is rozfpus and dovkpus\"\n\ndafvpus is from duzvpus, because \"duzvpus is dafvpus and gekypus and pekppus\"\n\nduzvpus is from jamnpus, because \"jamnpus is duzvpus\"\n\njamnpus is from xemypus, because \"xemypus is jamnpus\"\n\nxemypus is from bixjpus, because \"bixjpus is xemypus and pavvpus\"\n\nbixjpus is from hismpus, because \"hismpus is bixjpus\"\n\nhismpus is from luwxpus, because \"luwxpus is hismpus and hiqtpus\"\n\nluwxpus is from katnpus, because \"katnpus is luwxpus and cirypus\"\n\nkatnpus is from bibypus, because \"bibypus is katnpus\"\n\nbibypus is from vuchpus, because \"vuchpus is bibypus\"\n\nBut now, vuchpus is from where? Is there any statement that says what vuchpus is? From the information, we have \"vuchpus is bibypus\" but not what vuchpus is from. Similarly, we have \"wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus\" and also \"vopmpus is wusjpus\" but no link from vuchpus to wusjpus.\n\nSo, vuchpus is not connected to anything else? That can't be right because in the chain above, we have bibypus from vuchpus, but vuchpus itself is not defined as belonging to anything else.\n\nLet's read the given information again carefully.\n\nI see: \"vuchpus is bibypus\" but also, earlier, there is \"wusjpus is vuchpus\" ? Let's look at the initial given information.\n\nThe given information is: \"mefcpus is kisgpus and tavhpus. kexhpus is gizlpus. bixjpus is xemypus and pavvpus. xaffpus is rojmpus. fashpus is jiszpus and fomvpus. ciwnpus is gazspus. wuvmpus is voqgpus. pazzpus is hekhpus and wannpus. katnpus is luwxpus and cirypus. nopzpus is fecppus. dafvpus is rozfpus and dovkpus. rojmpus is pijxpus and bovdpus and sijzpus. zomnpus is vojypus. pijxpus is cikypus. xiqhpus is rinvpus. tovzpus is pecrpus. xemypus is jamnpus. nupppus is fojhpus and kuxbpus. xatwpus is fogdpus. vojypus is melspus. visrpus is pibnpus. bibypus is katnpus. jupvpus is wozwpus. wusjpus is nijppus and liswpus. hismpus is bixjpus. puxjpus is nekjpus and nifzpus. dipgpus is yefjpus. fuvlpus is redbpus. beyfpus is wafhpus and yeftpus. voqgpus is xaffpus and kojxpus. kezfpus is ciwnpus. nekjpus is nogfpus. yiytpus is beyfpus. maflpus is yiytpus and vehppus. mukrpus is lazcpus and xipvpus. vopmpus is wusjpus. redbpus is wutspus and natzpus. cikypus is lalwpus. fojhpus is vihdpus and vadxpus and xugvpus. wutspus is norfpus. lazcpus is xiqhpus. wurhpus is pazzpus. vashpus is wuvmpus. x is figfpus. wozwpus is babbpus and ruygpus. yefjpus is kezfpus. gazspus is fupcpus and xiwhpus. rozfpus is votppus and juffpus and gufwpus and wenhpus. qijtpus is zomnpus. nogfpus is visrpus and tokspus. wafhpus is vashpus. wusjpus is vuchpus. cunbpus is nupppus and nelrpus. deqzpus is wijdpus and badlpus and kuttpus. duzvpus is dafvpus and gekypus and pekppus. melspus is mukrpus and qopxpus. kisgpus is kexhpus and coyrpus and vermpus. pecrpus is kuclpus. wijdpus is puxjpus. ziprpus is xatwpus and suqvpus. wuvmpus is qonzpus. gizlpus is fuvlpus and nustpus. luwxpus is hismpus and hiqtpus. jamnpus is duzvpus. fupcpus is deqzpus. pibnpus is nopzpus and miympus. fecppus is wurhpus and cogdpus and qutlpus. votppus is lelmpus. vuchpus is bibypus. rinvpus is cunbpus. lelmpus is qijtpus. vowlpus is ziprpus. fogdpus is mefcpus and dofzpus. kuclpus is dipgpus. figfpus is tovzpus. yiytpus is fashpus. norfpus is jupvpus and wulfpus. vihdpus is vowlpus. lalwpus is vopmpus. hekhpus is maflpus. \"\n\nAh!

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nTherefore, the answer is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

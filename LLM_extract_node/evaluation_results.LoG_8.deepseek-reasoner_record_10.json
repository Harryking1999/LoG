  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus. From the given information, x is defined as nuwfpus and mirfpus. But I don't have any information about mirfpus, so I might need to focus on nuwfpus since that's part of x.\n\nNow, looking at the relationships, I see that guzbpus is babbpus and kuslpus and buckpus. So babbpus is a category that guzbpus belongs to. But I need to see if x is connected to babbpus.\n\nI have x is nuwfpus and mirfpus. I need to trace nuwfpus to see if it leads to babbpus.\n\nFrom the given: nuwfpus is raxgpus.\n\nThen raxgpus is geklpus.\n\ngeklpus is hastpus.\n\nhastpus is wactpus.\n\nwactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus. I don't know hiwzpus, so I'll focus on wadppus.\n\nwadppus is qavwpus.\n\nqavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus. liycpus might not be known, so tiqjpus.\n\ntiqjpus is sopypus.\n\nsopypus is coykpus.\n\ncoykpus is puwppus. But also, coykpus is wuyhpus? No, from given: coykpus is wuyhpus and also coykpus is puwppus? That might be inconsistent, but let's see.\n\nFrom given: coykpus is wuyhpus. But also, sopypus is coykpus, and coykpus is puwppus? Wait, no: from \"coykpus is puwppus\" is stated? Let me check.\n\nLooking back: \"coykpus is wuyhpus.\" and \"sopypus is coykpus.\" but I don't see \"coykpus is puwppus\" directly. Wait, there is: \"puwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus.\" and \"coykpus is puwppus\"? No.\n\nI see: \"coykpus is wuyhpus.\" and then later \"coykpus is puwppus.\"? Let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the list: \"coykpus is wuyhpus.\" is given. Then later, \"sopypus is coykpus.\" and then \"puwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus.\" but no direct link that coykpus is puwppus.\n\nWait, I think I misread. Let's find all mentions of coykpus.\n\nFrom given: \"coykpus is wuyhpus.\" and \"sopypus is coykpus.\" and that's it? But then I have \"qavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus\" and \"tiqjpus is sopypus\" so sopypus is coykpus, so tiqjpus is sopypus is coykpus.\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus. This path doesn't seem to lead to babbpus yet.\n\nI have another path: from x is nuwfpus, and nuwfpus is raxgpus, raxgpus is geklpus, geklpus is hastpus, hastpus is wactpus, wactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus, wadppus is qavwpus, qavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus, tiqjpus is sopypus, sopypus is coykpus, coykpus is wuyhpus? But wuyhpus is not known to connect to babbpus.\n\nI need to find a connection to guzbpus since guzbpus is babbpus.\n\nguzbpus is babbpus and kuslpus and buckpus.\n\nAlso, hazrpus is guzbpus. And rakrpus is hazrpus. And suhnpus is rakrpus and hukppus. And komqpus is suhnpus. And xenmpus is komqpus and guyxpus. And lebwpus is xenmpus. And moggpus is lebwpus and qepypus. And zohypus is moggpus and tohqpus. And sacppus is zohypus. And kezjpus is sacppus and yahxpus. And mitrpus is kezjpus. And sigjpus is mitrpus and pevnpus. And vusspus is sigjpus and gagjpus. And fudjpus is vusspus and zumdpus. And kiybpus is fudjpus. And fizvpus is kiybpus. And barbpus is fizvpus and yoxspus. And kapbpus is barbpus and piwkpus. And pizdpus is kapbpus. And qonbpus is pizdpus and papfpus. And soscpus is qonbpus. And yodrpus is soscpus and gontpus. And ziwspus is yodrpus. And sifgpus is ziwspus. And covvpus is sifgpus. And luwxpus is covvpus and qidwpus. And vivbpus is luwxpus and wesxpus. And mukcpus is vivbpus. And barkpus is mukcpus and tejqpus. And yaxrpus is barkpus. And wapqpus is yaxrpus and cenhpus and kerfpus. And wuplpus is wapqpus. And gafdpus is wuplpus. And qamfpus is gafdpus and busspus. And biqmpus is qamfpus and qegppus. And qadlpus is biqmpus. And cabzpus is fisxpus? Wait, dacppus is cabzpus, and also dacppus is qadlpus? From given: \"dacppus is cabzpus.\" and \"dacppus is qadlpus.\" so dacppus is both cabzpus and qadlpus? But in the note, \"is\" means belongs to category, so dacppus belongs to cabzpus and also to qadlpus, so that might be possible.\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus from x.\n\nx is nuwfpus and mirfpus. I have no info on mirfpus, so I need to see if nuwfpus leads to babbpus.\n\nFrom nuwfpus is raxgpus.\n\nraxgpus is geklpus.\n\ngeklpus is hastpus.\n\nhastpus is wactpus.\n\nwactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus.\n\nwadppus is qavwpus.\n\nqavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus.\n\ntiqjpus is sopypus.\n\nsopypus is coykpus.\n\ncoykpus is wuyhpus? But wuyhpus is not connected further? Or is it?\n\nFrom coykpus is wuyhpus, but I also have coykpus is puwppus? No, from given, I don't see that. Let's list all \"is\" statements.\n\nFrom given: \"coykpus is wuyhpus.\" that's the only direct statement about coykpus.\n\nBut sopypus is coykpus, so sopypus belongs to coykpus, but coykpus is wuyhpus, so sopypus is also wuyhpus? But I need to see where wuyhpus goes.\n\nwuyhpus is not mentioned elsewhere, so this path might end.\n\nBut from wactpus, it is wadppus and hiwzpus. I have hiwzpus unknown, so only wadppus is known.\n\nBut from wadppus to qavwpus to tiqjpus to sopypus to coykpus to wuyhpus, and no further, so this doesn't lead to babbpus.\n\nBut I recall that from other parts, there might be a connection through telqpus or something.\n\nAnother thought: from hastpus is wactpus, but hastpus is also geklpus, and geklpus is hastpus? Wait, geklpus is hastpus, so hastpus is geklpus? No, from \"geklpus is hastpus\" means geklpus belongs to hastpus, so hastpus is a category containing geklpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"hastpus is wactpus\" means hastpus belongs to wactpus, so wactpus is a category containing hastpus.\n\nBut from x, we have nuwfpus is raxgpus, raxgpus is geklpus, so raxgpus belongs to geklpus, and geklpus belongs to hastpus, so raxgpus belongs to hastpus, and hastpus belongs to wactpus, so raxgpus belongs to wactpus.\n\nBut wactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus, so wactpus belongs to wadppus and hiwzpus? No, from \"wactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus\" means wactpus belongs to wadppus and also to hiwzpus? That seems odd, but according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so wactpus belongs to the category wadppus and also to hiwzpus.\n\nSo wactpus is a member of wadppus and hiwzpus.\n\nSimilarly, wadppus is qavwpus, so wadppus belongs to qavwpus.\n\nSo from raxgpus, it belongs to hastpus, which belongs to wactpus, which belongs to wadppus, which belongs to qavwpus.\n\nqavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus, so qavwpus belongs to tiqjpus and liycpus.\n\nSo ultimately, raxgpus belongs to tiqjpus and liycpus.\n\ntiqjpus is sopypus, so tiqjpus belongs to sopypus.\n\nsopypus is coykpus, so sopypus belongs to coykpus.\n\ncoykpus is wuyhpus, so coykpus belongs to wuyhpus.\n\nSo raxgpus belongs to wuyhpus through this chain.\n\nBut wuyhpus is not connected to babbpus, so this doesn't help.\n\nNow, I need to find another path from x to babbpus.\n\nx is also mirfpus, but no information on mirfpus, so that doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps from other relations.\n\nNotice that from guzbpus is babbpus, so if I can find if x is guzbpus or belongs to guzbpus.\n\nguzbpus is mentioned in hazrpus is guzbpus.\n\nAnd rakrpus is hazrpus.\n\nAnd suhnpus is rakrpus and hukppus.\n\nAnd komqpus is suhnpus.\n\nAnd xenmpus is komqpus and guyxpus.\n\nAnd lebwpus is xenmpus.\n\nAnd moggpus is lebwpus and qepypus.\n\nAnd zohypus is moggpus and tohqpus.\n\nAnd sacppus is zohypus.\n\nAnd kezjpus is sacppus and yahxpus.\n\nAnd mitrpus is kezjpus.\n\nAnd sigjpus is mitrpus and pevnpus.\n\nAnd vusspus is sigjpus and gagjpus.\n\nAnd fudjpus is vusspus and zumdpus.\n\nAnd kiybpus is fudjpus.\n\nAnd fizvpus is kiybpus.\n\nAnd barbpus is fizvpus and yoxspus.\n\nAnd kapbpus is barbpus and piwkpus.\n\nAnd pizdpus is kapbpus.\n\nAnd qonbpus is pizdpus and papfpus.\n\nAnd soscpus is qonbpus.\n\nAnd yodrpus is soscpus and gontpus.\n\nAnd ziwspus is yodrpus.\n\nAnd sifgpus is ziwspus.\n\nAnd covvpus is sifgpus.\n\nAnd luwxpus is covvpus and qidwpus.\n\nAnd vivbpus is luwxpus and wesxpus.\n\nAnd mukcpus is vivbpus.\n\nAnd barkpus is mukcpus and tejqpus.\n\nAnd yaxrpus is barkpus.\n\nAnd wapqpus is yaxrpus and cenhpus and kerfpus.\n\nAnd wuplpus is wapqpus.\n\nAnd gafdpus is wuplpus.\n\nAnd qamfpus is gafdpus and busspus.\n\nAnd biqmpus is qamfpus and qegppus.\n\nAnd qadlpus is biqmpus.\n\nAnd dacppus is qadlpus.\n\nAlso, dacppus is cabzpus.\n\nBut from x, we have nuwfpus, which is raxgpus, which is geklpus.\n\ngeklpus is hastpus.\n\nhastpus is wactpus.\n\nBut is there a connection from wactpus to this chain?\n\nwactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus.\n\nwadppus is qavwpus.\n\nqavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus.\n\ntiqjpus is sopypus.\n\nsopypus is coykpus.\n\ncoykpus is wuyhpus.\n\nBut wuyhpus is not in the chain above.\n\nPerhaps from other side.\n\nNotice that from barkpus is mukcpus and tejqpus, and yaxrpus is barkpus, and wapqpus is yaxrpus, etc., but that doesn't connect to x.\n\nx is nuwfpus and mirfpus.\n\nnuwfpus is raxgpus.\n\nraxgpus is geklpus.\n\ngeklpus is hastpus.\n\nIs hastpus connected to anything else? hastpus is wactpus, but that's it.\n\nBut from the given, there is: \"telqpus is geycpus\" and \"doympus is telqpus and hiwjpus\" and \"veyzpus is doympus and nocspus\" and \"bufmpus is veyzpus\" and \"tegxpus is bufmpus\" and \"puwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus\" but puwppus is also mentioned? coykpus is puwppus? No, from given, I don't see that.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"coykpus is wuyhpus\" only.\n\nBut in the question, we have x, and from x, we have to see if it is babbpus.\n\nPerhaps from mirfpus, but no information, so it might be unknown.\n\nBut let's see if there is a common category.\n\nAnother idea: from guzbpus is babbpus, and hazrpus is guzbpus, so if x is hazrpus or something.\n\nBut from x, it is nuwfpus, and nuwfpus is raxgpus, etc.\n\nIs there a connection between raxgpus and hazrpus?\n\nraxgpus is geklpus.\n\ngeklpus is hastpus.\n\nhastpus is wactpus.\n\nwactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus.\n\nwadppus is qavwpus.\n\nqavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus.\n\ntiqjpus is sopypus.\n\nsopypus is coykpus.\n\ncoykpus is wuyhpus.\n\nNo connection.\n\nPerhaps from levnpus or something.\n\nlevnpus is gelcpus? From \"levnpus is gelcpus\" but gelcpus not connected.\n\nFrom \"telqpus is levnpus\" and \"telqpus is geycpus\" and \"telqpus is dargpus\" so telqpus belongs to multiple categories.\n\nBut from x, how to reach telqpus?\n\nFrom doympus is telqpus and hiwjpus, and veyzpus is doympus and nocspus, and bufmpus is veyzpus, and tegxpus is bufmpus, and puwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus, but puwppus is not connected to x.\n\nFrom coykpus is puwppus? No, not stated.\n\nIn the given, there is \"coykpus is wuyhpus\" and that's it.\n\nBut earlier in the list, I see \"coykpus is puwppus\" is not there. Let's double-check the given information.\n\nI think I might have missed something. Let's read the given information again thoroughly.\n\n**Given Information**: \n- barkpus is mukcpus and tejqpus. \n- fizvpus is kiybpus. \n- doympus is telqpus and hiwjpus. \n- geycpus is cohspus. \n- levnpus is gelcpus. \n- bufmpus is veyzpus. \n- dargpus is sowcpus and ratppus. \n- soscpus is qonbpus. \n- komqpus is suhnpus. \n- guzbpus is babbpus and kuslpus and buckpus. \n- sacppus is zohypus. \n- rakrpus is hazrpus. \n- dacppus is cabzpus. \n- kapbpus is barbpus and piwkpus. \n- tiqjpus is sopypus. \n- ziwspus is yodrpus. \n- fudjpus is vusspus and zumdpus. \n- puwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus. \n- mukcpus is vivbpus. \n- geklpus is hastpus. \n- telqpus is geycpus. \n- vivbpus is luwxpus and wesxpus. \n- qavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus. \n- kezjpus is sacppus and yahxpus. \n- gafdpus is wuplpus. \n- dacppus is qadlpus. \n- coykpus is wuyhpus. \n- wuplpus is wapqpus. \n- xenmpus is komqpus and guyxpus. \n- nuwfpus is raxgpus. \n- raxgpus is geklpus. \n- luwxpus is covvpus and qidwpus. \n- wadppus is qavwpus. \n- biqmpus is qamfpus and qegppus. \n- zohypus is moggpus and tohqpus. \n- yodrpus is soscpus and gontpus. \n- qadlpus is biqmpus. \n- covvpus is sifgpus. \n- sowcpus is zaltpus. \n- cabzpus is fisxpus. \n- sopypus is coykpus. \n- veyzpus is doympus and nocspus. \n- fizvpus is lertpus. \n- wapqpus is yaxrpus and cenhpus and kerfpus. \n- sigjpus is mitrpus and pevnpus. \n- tegxpus is bufmpus. \n- coykpus is puwppus.  -- wait! here it is! \"coykpus is puwppus.\" \n- qonbpus is pizdpus and papfpus. \n- kiybpus is fudjpus. \n- wactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus. \n- telqpus is dargpus. \n- hastpus is wactpus. \n- barbpus is fizvpus and yoxspus. \n- vusspus is sigjpus and gagjpus. \n- moggpus is lebwpus and qepypus. \n- zaltpus is dacppus and lepjpus. \n- yaxrpus is barkpus. \n- x is nuwfpus and mirfpus. \n- pizdpus is kapbpus. \n- mitrpus is kezjpus. \n- suhnpus is rakrpus and hukppus. \n- telqpus is levnpus. \n- qamfpus is gafdpus and busspus. \n- sifgpus is ziwspus. \n- hazrpus is guzbpus. \n- lebwpus is xenmpus.\n\nAh! I missed \"coykpus is puwppus\" in my initial reading. So coykpus is both wuyhpus and puwppus? From the given, it says \"coykpus is wuyhpus\" and later \"coykpus is puwppus\", so coykpus belongs to both wuyhpus and puwppus.\n\nSo from sopypus is coykpus, so sopypus belongs to coykpus, which belongs to puwppus.\n\npuwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus.\n\ntegxpus is bufmpus.\n\nbufmpus is veyzpus.\n\nveyzpus is doympus and nocspus.\n\ndoympus is telqpus and hiwjpus.\n\ntelqpus is geycpus, and telqpus is dargpus, and telqpus is levnpus.\n\nBut also, from dargpus is sowcpus and ratppus.\n\nsowcpus is zaltpus.\n\nzaltpus is dacppus and lepjpus.\n\ndacppus is cabzpus and dacppus is qadlpus.\n\nqadlpus is biqmpus.\n\nbiqmpus is qamfpus and qegppus.\n\nqamfpus is gafdpus and busspus.\n\ngafdpus is wuplpus.\n\nwuplpus is wapqpus.\n\nwapqpus is yaxrpus and cenhpus and kerfpus.\n\nyaxrpus is barkpus.\n\nbarkpus is mukcpus and tejqpus.\n\nmukcpus is vivbpus.\n\nvivbpus is luwxpus and wesxpus.\n\nluwxpus is covvpus and qidwpus.\n\ncovvpus is sifgpus.\n\nsifgpus is ziwspus.\n\nziwspus is yodrpus.\n\nyodrpus is soscpus and gontpus.\n\nsoscpus is qonbpus.\n\nqonbpus is pizdpus and papfpus.\n\npizdpus is kapbpus.\n\nkapbpus is barbpus and piwkpus.\n\nbarbpus is fizvpus and yoxspus.\n\nfizvpus is kiybpus and fizvpus is lertpus.\n\nkiybpus is fudjpus.\n\nfudjpus is vusspus and zumdpus.\n\nvusspus is sigjpus and gagjpus.\n\nsigjpus is mitrpus and pevnpus.\n\nmitrpus is kezjpus.\n\nkezjpus is sacppus and yahxpus.\n\nsacppus is zohypus.\n\nzohypus is moggpus and tohqpus.\n\nmoggpus is lebwpus and qepypus.\n\nlebwpus is xenmpus.\n\nxenmpus is komqpus and guyxpus.\n\nkomqpus is suhnpus.\n\nsuhnpus is rakrpus and hukppus.\n\nrakrpus is hazrpus.\n\nhazrpus is guzbpus.\n\nguzbpus is babbpus and kuslpus and buckpus.\n\nSo ultimately, through this long chain, we can see that coykpus belongs to puwppus, and through multiple steps, it connects to guzbpus, which is babbpus.\n\nBut we have x is nuwfpus and mirfpus.\n\nnuwfpus is raxgpus.\n\nraxgpus is geklpus.\n\ngeklpus is hastpus.\n\nhastpus is wactpus.\n\nwactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus.\n\nwadppus is qavwpus.\n\nqavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus.\n\ntiqjpus is sopypus.\n\nsopypus is coykpus.\n\nSo from nuwfpus, we have a path to coykpus.\n\nAnd from coykpus, we have a path to babbpus as above.\n\nTherefore, since coykpus belongs to babbpus through the chain, and nuwfpus belongs to coykpus, so nuwfpus belongs to babbpus.\n\nx is nuwfpus and mirfpus, so x belongs to nuwfpus, so x also belongs to babbpus? But careful: \"x is nuwfpus and mirfpus\" means x belongs to nuwfpus and also to mirfpus. So since x belongs to nuwfpus, and nuwfpus belongs to babbpus, then x belongs to babbpus.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nBut let's confirm the chain from coykpus to babbpus.\n\nFrom coykpus is puwppus.\n\npuwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus. We need to go to tegxpus.\n\ntegxpus is bufmpus.\n\nbufmpus is veyzpus.\n\nveyzpus is doympus and nocspus. We need doympus.\n\ndoympus is telqpus and hiwjpus. We need telqpus.\n\nBut telqpus is also connected to other things, but we need to reach guzbpus.\n\nFrom telqpus, we have telqpus is dargpus? But from doympus is telqpus, so doympus belongs to telqpus, so from veyzpus is doympus, so veyzpus belongs to doympus, which belongs to telqpus.\n\nBut telqpus is also geycpus, levnpus, etc., but we need to go to dargpus? From telqpus is dargpus, so telqpus belongs to dargpus.\n\ndargpus is sowcpus and ratppus.\n\nsowcpus is zaltpus.\n\nzaltpus is dacppus and lepjpus.\n\ndacppus is qadlpus? From \"dacppus is qadlpus\" and also \"dacppus is cabzpus\", but we can go to qadlpus.\n\nqadlpus is biqmpus.\n\nbiqmpus is qamfpus and qegppus.\n\nqamfpus is gafdpus and busspus.\n\ngafdpus is wuplpus.\n\nwuplpus is wapqpus.\n\nwapqpus is yaxrpus and cenhpus and kerfpus.\n\nyaxrpus is barkpus.\n\nbarkpus is mukcpus and tejqpus.\n\nmukcpus is vivbpus.\n\nvivbpus is luwxpus and wesxpus.\n\nluwxpus is covvpus and qidwpus.\n\ncovvpus is sifgpus.\n\nsifgpus is ziwspus.\n\nziwspus is yodrpus.\n\nyodrpus is soscpus and gontpus.\n\nsoscpus is qonbpus.\n\nqonbpus is pizdpus and papfpus.\n\npizdpus is kapbpus.\n\nkapbpus is barbpus and piwkpus.\n\nbarbpus is fizvpus and yoxspus.\n\nfizvpus is kiybpus.\n\nkiybpus is fudjpus.\n\nfudjpus is vusspus and zumdpus.\n\nvusspus is sigjpus and gagjpus.\n\nsigjpus is mitrpus and pevnpus.\n\nmitrpus is kezjpus.\n\nkezjpus is sacppus and yahxpus.\n\nsacppus is zohypus.\n\nzohypus is moggpus and tohqpus.\n\nmoggpus is lebwpus and qepypus.\n\nlebwpus is xenmpus.\n\nxenmpus is komqpus and guyxpus.\n\nkomqpus is suhnpus.\n\nsuhnpus is rakrpus and hukppus.\n\nrakrpus is hazrpus.\n\nhazrpus is guzbpus.\n\nguzbpus is babbpus.\n\nSo yes, this chain connects from coykpus to babbpus.\n\nTherefore, since nuwfpus leads to coykpus, and coykpus leads to babbpus, so nuwfpus is babbpus.\n\nAnd since x is nuwfpus, so x is babbpus.\n\nThus, the statement is true.\n\nSo the answer should be true.",

I don't know hiwzpus, so I'll focus on wadppus.\n\nwadppus is qavwpus.\n\nqavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus. liycpus might not be known, so tiqjpus.\n\ntiqjpus is sopypus.\n\nsopypus is coykpus.\n\ncoykpus is puwppus. But also, coykpus is wuyhpus? No, from given: coykpus is wuyhpus and also coykpus is puwppus? That might be inconsistent, but let's see.\n\nFrom given: coykpus is wuyhpus. But also, sopypus is coykpus, and coykpus is puwppus? Wait, no: from \"coykpus is puwppus\" is stated? Let me check.\n\nLooking back: \"coykpus is wuyhpus.\" and \"sopypus is coykpus.\" but I don't see \"coykpus is puwppus\" directly. Wait, there is: \"puwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus.\" and \"coykpus is puwppus\"? No.\n\nI see: \"coykpus is wuyhpus.\" and then later \"coykpus is puwppus.\"? Let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the list: \"coykpus is wuyhpus.\" is given. Then later, \"sopypus is coykpus.\" and then \"puwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus.\" but no direct link that coykpus is puwppus.\n\nWait, I think I misread. Let's find all mentions of coykpus.\n\nFrom given: \"coykpus is wuyhpus.\" and \"sopypus is coykpus.\" and that's it? But then I have \"qavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus\" and \"tiqjpus is sopypus\" so sopypus is coykpus, so tiqjpus is sopypus is coykpus.\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus. This path doesn't seem to lead to babbpus yet.\n\nI have another path: from x is nuwfpus, and nuwfpus is raxgpus, raxgpus is geklpus, geklpus is hastpus, hastpus is wactpus, wactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus, wadppus is qavwpus, qavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus, tiqjpus is sopypus, sopypus is coykpus, coykpus is wuyhpus? But wuyhpus is not known to connect to babbpus.\n\nI need to find a connection to guzbpus since guzbpus is babbpus.\n\nguzbpus is babbpus and kuslpus and buckpus.\n\nAlso, hazrpus is guzbpus. And rakrpus is hazrpus. And suhnpus is rakrpus and hukppus. And komqpus is suhnpus. And xenmpus is komqpus and guyxpus. And lebwpus is xenmpus. And moggpus is lebwpus and qepypus. And zohypus is moggpus and tohqpus. And sacppus is zohypus. And kezjpus is sacppus and yahxpus. And mitrpus is kezjpus. And sigjpus is mitrpus and pevnpus. And vusspus is sigjpus and gagjpus. And fudjpus is vusspus and zumdpus. And kiybpus is fudjpus. And fizvpus is kiybpus. And barbpus is fizvpus and yoxspus. And kapbpus is barbpus and piwkpus. And pizdpus is kapbpus. And qonbpus is pizdpus and papfpus. And soscpus is qonbpus. And yodrpus is soscpus and gontpus. And ziwspus is yodrpus. And sifgpus is ziwspus. And covvpus is sifgpus. And luwxpus is covvpus and qidwpus. And vivbpus is luwxpus and wesxpus. And mukcpus is vivbpus. And barkpus is mukcpus and tejqpus. And yaxrpus is barkpus. And wapqpus is yaxrpus and cenhpus and kerfpus. And wuplpus is wapqpus. And gafdpus is wuplpus. And qamfpus is gafdpus and busspus. And biqmpus is qamfpus and qegppus. And qadlpus is biqmpus. And cabzpus is fisxpus? Wait, dacppus is cabzpus, and also dacppus is qadlpus? From given: \"dacppus is cabzpus.\" and \"dacppus is qadlpus.\" so dacppus is both cabzpus and qadlpus? But in the note, \"is\" means belongs to category, so dacppus belongs to cabzpus and also to qadlpus, so that might be possible.\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus from x.\n\nx is nuwfpus and mirfpus. I have no info on mirfpus, so I need to see if nuwfpus leads to babbpus.\n\nFrom nuwfpus is raxgpus.\n\nraxgpus is geklpus.\n\ngeklpus is hastpus.\n\nhastpus is wactpus.\n\nwactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus.\n\nwadppus is qavwpus.\n\nqavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus.\n\ntiqjpus is sopypus.\n\nsopypus is coykpus.\n\ncoykpus is wuyhpus? But wuyhpus is not connected further? Or is it?\n\nFrom coykpus is wuyhpus, but I also have coykpus is puwppus? No, from given, I don't see that. Let's list all \"is\" statements.\n\nFrom given: \"coykpus is wuyhpus.\" that's the only direct statement about coykpus.\n\nBut sopypus is coykpus, so sopypus belongs to coykpus, but coykpus is wuyhpus, so sopypus is also wuyhpus? But I need to see where wuyhpus goes.\n\nwuyhpus is not mentioned elsewhere, so this path might end.\n\nBut from wactpus, it is wadppus and hiwzpus. I have hiwzpus unknown, so only wadppus is known.\n\nBut from wadppus to qavwpus to tiqjpus to sopypus to coykpus to wuyhpus, and no further, so this doesn't lead to babbpus.\n\nBut I recall that from other parts, there might be a connection through telqpus or something.\n\nAnother thought: from hastpus is wactpus, but hastpus is also geklpus, and geklpus is hastpus? Wait, geklpus is hastpus, so hastpus is geklpus? No, from \"geklpus is hastpus\" means geklpus belongs to hastpus, so hastpus is a category containing geklpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"hastpus is wactpus\" means hastpus belongs to wactpus, so wactpus is a category containing hastpus.\n\nBut from x, we have nuwfpus is raxgpus, raxgpus is geklpus, so raxgpus belongs to geklpus, and geklpus belongs to hastpus, so raxgpus belongs to hastpus, and hastpus belongs to wactpus, so raxgpus belongs to wactpus.\n\nBut wactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus, so wactpus belongs to wadppus and hiwzpus? No, from \"wactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus\" means wactpus belongs to wadppus and also to hiwzpus? That seems odd, but according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so wactpus belongs to the category wadppus and also to hiwzpus.\n\nSo wactpus is a member of wadppus and hiwzpus.\n\nSimilarly, wadppus is qavwpus, so wadppus belongs to qavwpus.\n\nSo from raxgpus, it belongs to hastpus, which belongs to wactpus, which belongs to wadppus, which belongs to qavwpus.\n\nqavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus, so qavwpus belongs to tiqjpus and liycpus.\n\nSo ultimately, raxgpus belongs to tiqjpus and liycpus.\n\ntiqjpus is sopypus, so tiqjpus belongs to sopypus.\n\nsopypus is coykpus, so sopypus belongs to coykpus.\n\ncoykpus is wuyhpus, so coykpus belongs to wuyhpus.\n\nSo raxgpus belongs to wuyhpus through this chain.\n\nBut wuyhpus is not connected to babbpus, so this doesn't help.\n\nNow, I need to find another path from x to babbpus.\n\nx is also mirfpus, but no information on mirfpus, so that doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps from other relations.\n\nNotice that from guzbpus is babbpus, so if I can find if x is guzbpus or belongs to guzbpus.\n\nguzbpus is mentioned in hazrpus is guzbpus.\n\nAnd rakrpus is hazrpus.\n\nAnd suhnpus is rakrpus and hukppus.\n\nAnd komqpus is suhnpus.\n\nAnd xenmpus is komqpus and guyxpus.\n\nAnd lebwpus is xenmpus.\n\nAnd moggpus is lebwpus and qepypus.\n\nAnd zohypus is moggpus and tohqpus.\n\nAnd sacppus is zohypus.\n\nAnd kezjpus is sacppus and yahxpus.\n\nAnd mitrpus is kezjpus.\n\nAnd sigjpus is mitrpus and pevnpus.\n\nAnd vusspus is sigjpus and gagjpus.\n\nAnd fudjpus is vusspus and zumdpus.\n\nAnd kiybpus is fudjpus.\n\nAnd fizvpus is kiybpus.\n\nAnd barbpus is fizvpus and yoxspus.\n\nAnd kapbpus is barbpus and piwkpus.\n\nAnd pizdpus is kapbpus.\n\nAnd qonbpus is pizdpus and papfpus.\n\nAnd soscpus is qonbpus.\n\nAnd yodrpus is soscpus and gontpus.\n\nAnd ziwspus is yodrpus.\n\nAnd sifgpus is ziwspus.\n\nAnd covvpus is sifgpus.\n\nAnd luwxpus is covvpus and qidwpus.\n\nAnd vivbpus is luwxpus and wesxpus.\n\nAnd mukcpus is vivbpus.\n\nAnd barkpus is mukcpus and tejqpus.\n\nAnd yaxrpus is barkpus.\n\nAnd wapqpus is yaxrpus and cenhpus and kerfpus.\n\nAnd wuplpus is wapqpus.\n\nAnd gafdpus is wuplpus.\n\nAnd qamfpus is gafdpus and busspus.\n\nAnd biqmpus is qamfpus and qegppus.\n\nAnd qadlpus is biqmpus.\n\nAnd dacppus is qadlpus.\n\nAlso, dacppus is cabzpus.\n\nBut from x, we have nuwfpus, which is raxgpus, which is geklpus.\n\ngeklpus is hastpus.\n\nhastpus is wactpus.\n\nBut is there a connection from wactpus to this chain?\n\nwactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus.\n\nwadppus is qavwpus.\n\nqavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus.\n\ntiqjpus is sopypus.\n\nsopypus is coykpus.\n\ncoykpus is wuyhpus.\n\nBut wuyhpus is not in the chain above.\n\nPerhaps from other side.\n\nNotice that from barkpus is mukcpus and tejqpus, and yaxrpus is barkpus, and wapqpus is yaxrpus, etc., but that doesn't connect to x.\n\nx is nuwfpus and mirfpus.\n\nnuwfpus is raxgpus.\n\nraxgpus is geklpus.\n\ngeklpus is hastpus.\n\nIs hastpus connected to anything else? hastpus is wactpus, but that's it.\n\nBut from the given, there is: \"telqpus is geycpus\" and \"doympus is telqpus and hiwjpus\" and \"veyzpus is doympus and nocspus\" and \"bufmpus is veyzpus\" and \"tegxpus is bufmpus\" and \"puwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus\" but puwppus is also mentioned? coykpus is puwppus? No, from given, I don't see that.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"coykpus is wuyhpus\" only.\n\nBut in the question, we have x, and from x, we have to see if it is babbpus.\n\nPerhaps from mirfpus, but no information, so it might be unknown.\n\nBut let's see if there is a common category.\n\nAnother idea: from guzbpus is babbpus, and hazrpus is guzbpus, so if x is hazrpus or something.\n\nBut from x, it is nuwfpus, and nuwfpus is raxgpus, etc.\n\nIs there a connection between raxgpus and hazrpus?\n\nraxgpus is geklpus.\n\ngeklpus is hastpus.\n\nhastpus is wactpus.\n\nwactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus.\n\nwadppus is qavwpus.\n\nqavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus.\n\ntiqjpus is sopypus.\n\nsopypus is coykpus.\n\ncoykpus is wuyhpus.\n\nNo connection.\n\nPerhaps from levnpus or something.\n\nlevnpus is gelcpus? From \"levnpus is gelcpus\" but gelcpus not connected.\n\nFrom \"telqpus is levnpus\" and \"telqpus is geycpus\" and \"telqpus is dargpus\" so telqpus belongs to multiple categories.\n\nBut from x, how to reach telqpus?\n\nFrom doympus is telqpus and hiwjpus, and veyzpus is doympus and nocspus, and bufmpus is veyzpus, and tegxpus is bufmpus, and puwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus, but puwppus is not connected to x.\n\nFrom coykpus is puwppus? No, not stated.\n\nIn the given, there is \"coykpus is wuyhpus\" and that's it.\n\nBut earlier in the list, I see \"coykpus is puwppus\" is not there. Let's double-check the given information.\n\nI think I might have missed something. Let's read the given information again thoroughly.\n\n**Given Information**: \n- barkpus is mukcpus and tejqpus. \n- fizvpus is kiybpus. \n- doympus is telqpus and hiwjpus. \n- geycpus is cohspus. \n- levnpus is gelcpus. \n- bufmpus is veyzpus. \n- dargpus is sowcpus and ratppus. \n- soscpus is qonbpus. \n- komqpus is suhnpus. \n- guzbpus is babbpus and kuslpus and buckpus. \n- sacppus is zohypus. \n- rakrpus is hazrpus. \n- dacppus is cabzpus. \n- kapbpus is barbpus and piwkpus. \n- tiqjpus is sopypus. \n- ziwspus is yodrpus. \n- fudjpus is vusspus and zumdpus. \n- puwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus. \n- mukcpus is vivbpus. \n- geklpus is hastpus. \n- telqpus is geycpus. \n- vivbpus is luwxpus and wesxpus. \n- qavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus. \n- kezjpus is sacppus and yahxpus. \n- gafdpus is wuplpus. \n- dacppus is qadlpus. \n- coykpus is wuyhpus. \n- wuplpus is wapqpus. \n- xenmpus is komqpus and guyxpus. \n- nuwfpus is raxgpus. \n- raxgpus is geklpus. \n- luwxpus is covvpus and qidwpus. \n- wadppus is qavwpus. \n- biqmpus is qamfpus and qegppus. \n- zohypus is moggpus and tohqpus. \n- yodrpus is soscpus and gontpus. \n- qadlpus is biqmpus. \n- covvpus is sifgpus. \n- sowcpus is zaltpus. \n- cabzpus is fisxpus. \n- sopypus is coykpus. \n- veyzpus is doympus and nocspus. \n- fizvpus is lertpus. \n- wapqpus is yaxrpus and cenhpus and kerfpus. \n- sigjpus is mitrpus and pevnpus. \n- tegxpus is bufmpus. \n- coykpus is puwppus.  -- wait! here it is! \"coykpus is puwppus.\" \n- qonbpus is pizdpus and papfpus. \n- kiybpus is fudjpus. \n- wactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus. \n- telqpus is dargpus. \n- hastpus is wactpus. \n- barbpus is fizvpus and yoxspus. \n- vusspus is sigjpus and gagjpus. \n- moggpus is lebwpus and qepypus. \n- zaltpus is dacppus and lepjpus. \n- yaxrpus is barkpus. \n- x is nuwfpus and mirfpus. \n- pizdpus is kapbpus. \n- mitrpus is kezjpus. \n- suhnpus is rakrpus and hukppus. \n- telqpus is levnpus. \n- qamfpus is gafdpus and busspus. \n- sifgpus is ziwspus. \n- hazrpus is guzbpus. \n- lebwpus is xenmpus.\n\nAh! I missed \"coykpus is puwppus\" in my initial reading. So coykpus is both wuyhpus and puwppus? From the given, it says \"coykpus is wuyhpus\" and later \"coykpus is puwppus\", so coykpus belongs to both wuyhpus and puwppus.\n\nSo from sopypus is coykpus, so sopypus belongs to coykpus, which belongs to puwppus.\n\npuwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus.\n\ntegxpus is bufmpus.\n\nbufmpus is veyzpus.\n\nveyzpus is doympus and nocspus.\n\ndoympus is telqpus and hiwjpus.\n\ntelqpus is geycpus, and telqpus is dargpus, and telqpus is levnpus.\n\nBut also, from dargpus is sowcpus and ratppus.\n\nsowcpus is zaltpus.\n\nzaltpus is dacppus and lepjpus.\n\ndacppus is cabzpus and dacppus is qadlpus.\n\nqadlpus is biqmpus.\n\nbiqmpus is qamfpus and qegppus.\n\nqamfpus is gafdpus and busspus.\n\ngafdpus is wuplpus.\n\nwuplpus is wapqpus.\n\nwapqpus is yaxrpus and cenhpus and kerfpus.\n\nyaxrpus is barkpus.\n\nbarkpus is mukcpus and tejqpus.\n\nmukcpus is vivbpus.\n\nvivbpus is luwxpus and wesxpus.\n\nluwxpus is covvpus and qidwpus.\n\ncovvpus is sifgpus.\n\nsifgpus is ziwspus.\n\nziwspus is yodrpus.\n\nyodrpus is soscpus and gontpus.\n\nsoscpus is qonbpus.\n\nqonbpus is pizdpus and papfpus.\n\npizdpus is kapbpus.\n\nkapbpus is barbpus and piwkpus.\n\nbarbpus is fizvpus and yoxspus.\n\nfizvpus is kiybpus and fizvpus is lertpus.\n\nkiybpus is fudjpus.\n\nfudjpus is vusspus and zumdpus.\n\nvusspus is sigjpus and gagjpus.\n\nsigjpus is mitrpus and pevnpus.\n\nmitrpus is kezjpus.\n\nkezjpus is sacppus and yahxpus.\n\nsacppus is zohypus.\n\nzohypus is moggpus and tohqpus.\n\nmoggpus is lebwpus and qepypus.\n\nlebwpus is xenmpus.\n\nxenmpus is komqpus and guyxpus.\n\nkomqpus is suhnpus.\n\nsuhnpus is rakrpus and hukppus.\n\nrakrpus is hazrpus.\n\nhazrpus is guzbpus.\n\nguzbpus is babbpus and kuslpus and buckpus.\n\nSo ultimately, through this long chain, we can see that coykpus belongs to puwppus, and through multiple steps, it connects to guzbpus, which is babbpus.\n\nBut we have x is nuwfpus and mirfpus.\n\nnuwfpus is raxgpus.\n\nraxgpus is geklpus.\n\ngeklpus is hastpus.\n\nhastpus is wactpus.\n\nwactpus is wadppus and hiwzpus.\n\nwadppus is qavwpus.\n\nqavwpus is tiqjpus and liycpus.\n\ntiqjpus is sopypus.\n\nsopypus is coykpus.\n\nSo from nuwfpus, we have a path to coykpus.\n\nAnd from coykpus, we have a path to babbpus as above.\n\nTherefore, since coykpus belongs to babbpus through the chain, and nuwfpus belongs to coykpus, so nuwfpus belongs to babbpus.\n\nx is nuwfpus and mirfpus, so x belongs to nuwfpus, so x also belongs to babbpus? But careful: \"x is nuwfpus and mirfpus\" means x belongs to nuwfpus and also to mirfpus. So since x belongs to nuwfpus, and nuwfpus belongs to babbpus, then x belongs to babbpus.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nBut let's confirm the chain from coykpus to babbpus.\n\nFrom coykpus is puwppus.\n\npuwppus is tegxpus and duwmpus. We need to go to tegxpus.\n\ntegxpus is bufmpus.\n\nbufmpus is veyzpus.\n\nveyzpus is doympus and nocspus. We need doympus.\n\ndoympus is telqpus and hiwjpus. We need telqpus.\n\nBut telqpus is also connected to other things, but we need to reach guzbpus.\n\nFrom telqpus, we have telqpus is dargpus? But from doympus is telqpus, so doympus belongs to telqpus, so from veyzpus is doympus, so veyzpus belongs to doympus, which belongs to telqpus.\n\nBut telqpus is also geycpus, levnpus, etc., but we need to go to dargpus? From telqpus is dargpus, so telqpus belongs to dargpus.\n\ndargpus is sowcpus and ratppus.\n\nsowcpus is zaltpus.\n\nzaltpus is dacppus and lepjpus.\n\ndacppus is qadlpus? From \"dacppus is qadlpus\" and also \"dacppus is cabzpus\", but we can go to qadlpus.\n\nqadlpus is biqmpus.\n\nbiqmpus is qamfpus and qegppus.\n\nqamfpus is gafdpus and busspus.\n\ngafdpus is wuplpus.\n\nwuplpus is wapqpus.\n\nwapqpus is yaxrpus and cenhpus and kerfpus.\n\nyaxrpus is barkpus.\n\nbarkpus is mukcpus and tejqpus.\n\nmukcpus is vivbpus.\n\nvivbpus is luwxpus and wesxpus.\n\nluwxpus is covvpus and qidwpus.\n\ncovvpus is sifgpus.\n\nsifgpus is ziwspus.\n\nziwspus is yodrpus.\n\nyodrpus is soscpus and gontpus.\n\nsoscpus is qonbpus.\n\nqonbpus is pizdpus and papfpus.\n\npizdpus is kapbpus.\n\nkapbpus is barbpus and piwkpus.\n\nbarbpus is fizvpus and yoxspus.\n\nfizvpus is kiybpus.\n\nkiybpus is fudjpus.\n\nfudjpus is vusspus and zumdpus.\n\nvusspus is sigjpus and gagjpus.\n\nsigjpus is mitrpus and pevnpus.\n\nmitrpus is kezjpus.\n\nkezjpus is sacppus and yahxpus.\n\nsacppus is zohypus.\n\nzohypus is moggpus and tohqpus.\n\nmoggpus is lebwpus and qepypus.\n\nlebwpus is xenmpus.\n\nxenmpus is komqpus and guyxpus.\n\nkomqpus is suhnpus.\n\nsuhnpus is rakrpus and hukppus.\n\nrakrpus is hazrpus.\n\nhazrpus is guzbpus.\n\nguzbpus is babbpus.\n\nSo yes, this chain connects from coykpus to babbpus.\n\nTherefore, since nuwfpus leads to coykpus, and coykpus leads to babbpus, so nuwfpus is babbpus.\n\nAnd since x is nuwfpus, so x is babbpus.\n\nThus, the statement is true.\n\nSo the answer should be true.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

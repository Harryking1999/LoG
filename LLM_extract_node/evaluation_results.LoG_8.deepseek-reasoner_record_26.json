  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the relationships given. The statements are of the form \"A is B\", which means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, it's about set membership or categorization.\n\nI have the following information:\n\n- howzpus is lotzpus.\n\n- jiprpus is kepqpus and raznpus.\n\n- yephpus is niykpus.\n\n- vamkpus is babbpus and cibdpus.\n\n- vamkpus is howzpus.\n\n- vamkpus is rehkpus and xubppus.\n\n- niykpus is vamkpus and zeqdpus.\n\n- x is jiprpus.\n\n- narypus is yephpus and yodcpus and hadnpus.\n\n- kepqpus is narypus and yovvpus.\n\nThe question is: Is it true or false or unknown that x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\n\nI need to find out if x belongs to babbpus, babcpus, or babppus. But note that babcpus and babppus are not mentioned in the given information. Only babbpus is mentioned. So, I might not have information about babcpus or babppus.\n\nLet me list out all the categories and entities mentioned.\n\nEntities: howzpus, jiprpus, yephpus, vamkpus, niykpus, x, narypus, kepqpus\n\nCategories: lotzpus, kepqpus, raznpus, niykpus, babbpus, cibdpus, howzpus, rehkpus, xubppus, zeqdpus, yephpus, yodcpus, hadnpus, narypus, yovvpus\n\nFrom the statements, some words are both entities and categories. For example, howzpus is an entity in \"howzpus is lotzpus\" but a category in \"vamkpus is howzpus\". Similarly, niykpus is a category in \"yephpus is niykpus\" but an entity in \"niykpus is vamkpus and zeqdpus\".\n\nI need to trace the relationships for x.\n\nWe know: x is jiprpus.\n\nAnd jiprpus is kepqpus and raznpus.\n\nSo, x is kepqpus and raznpus.\n\nNow, kepqpus is narypus and yovvpus.\n\nSo, since x is kepqpus, and kepqpus is narypus, so x is narypus? But let's be careful. \"jiprpus is kepqpus\" means jiprpus belongs to kepqpus, so jiprpus is a member of kepqpus. Similarly, \"kepqpus is narypus\" means kepqpus belongs to narypus, so kepqpus is a member of narypus. Therefore, since jiprpus is in kepqpus and kepqpus is in narypus, it implies that jiprpus is in narypus? But is that necessarily true? In set terms, if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C. But here, \"is\" might indicate membership, not subset. This is ambiguous.\n\nLet's read the note: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \". The phrase \"contained in\" could mean subset or membership. But in common usage in such puzzles, \"is\" often means membership, but sometimes it might imply hierarchy.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should think in terms of sets. Let me denote that \"A is B\" means that A is an element of set B. So, B is a category containing A.\n\nBut when we say \"A is B and C\", it means A is in B and A is in C, so A is a member of both sets B and C.\n\nSimilarly, if \"B is D\", it means B is a member of D.\n\nSo, for example, from \"jiprpus is kepqpus and raznpus\", jiprpus ∈ kepqpus and jiprpus ∈ raznpus.\n\nFrom \"kepqpus is narypus and yovvpus\", kepqpus ∈ narypus and kepqpus ∈ yovvpus.\n\nNow, since jiprpus ∈ kepqpus and kepqpus ∈ narypus, does this imply jiprpus ∈ narypus? Not necessarily. Because kepqpus is a member of narypus, meaning narypus is a set that contains kepqpus as an element, but jiprpus is an element of kepqpus, which is itself an element of narypus, so jiprpus is not directly an element of narypus unless narypus contains all elements of kepqpus, but that would require that kepqpus is a subset of narypus, which is not stated. Here, \"kepqpus is narypus\" means membership, not subset.\n\nSo, in standard set theory, if a ∈ B and B ∈ C, it does not mean that a ∈ C. For example, if B is a set and C is a set of sets, B ∈ C, but a ∈ B does not imply a ∈ C.\n\nTherefore, I cannot assume transitivity for membership.\n\nI need to find if x is in babbpus or babcpus or babppus.\n\nbabbpus is mentioned: vamkpus is babbpus and cibdpus, so vamkpus ∈ babbpus.\n\nBut x is jiprpus, and I need to see if x is related to vamkpus or directly to babbpus.\n\nAlso, babcpus and babppus are not mentioned, so unless there is a chain, I might not know about them.\n\nNow, let's list all statements:\n\n1. howzpus is lotzpus. → howzpus ∈ lotzpus\n\n2. jiprpus is kepqpus and raznpus. → jiprpus ∈ kepqpus and jiprpus ∈ raznpus\n\n3. yephpus is niykpus. → yephpus ∈ niykpus\n\n4. vamkpus is babbpus and cibdpus. → vamkpus ∈ babbpus and vamkpus ∈ cibdpus\n\n5. vamkpus is howzpus. → vamkpus ∈ howzpus\n\n6. vamkpus is rehkpus and xubppus. → vamkpus ∈ rehkpus and vamkpus ∈ xubppus\n\n7. niykpus is vamkpus and zeqdpus. → niykpus ∈ vamkpus and niykpus ∈ zeqdpus\n\n8. x is jiprpus. → x ∈ jiprpus\n\n9. narypus is yephpus and yodcpus and hadnpus. → narypus ∈ yephpus and narypus ∈ yodcpus and narypus ∈ hadnpus\n\n10. kepqpus is narypus and yovvpus. → kepqpus ∈ narypus and kepqpus ∈ yovvpus\n\nFrom 8, x is jiprpus, so x ∈ jiprpus.\n\nFrom 2, jiprpus ∈ kepqpus and jiprpus ∈ raznpus.\n\nFrom 10, kepqpus ∈ narypus and kepqpus ∈ yovvpus.\n\nBut as I thought, since jiprpus ∈ kepqpus and kepqpus ∈ narypus, it does not mean jiprpus ∈ narypus. Similarly, I don't have direct link from jiprpus to narypus.\n\nNow, from 9, narypus ∈ yephpus and narypus ∈ yodcpus and narypus ∈ hadnpus.\n\nFrom 3, yephpus ∈ niykpus.\n\nFrom 7, niykpus ∈ vamkpus and niykpus ∈ zeqdpus.\n\nFrom 4, vamkpus ∈ babbpus.\n\nFrom 5, vamkpus ∈ howzpus.\n\nFrom 1, howzpus ∈ lotzpus.\n\nBut I need to connect x to babbpus.\n\nx is jiprpus, which is in kepqpus, but kepqpus is in narypus, and narypus is in yephpus, yephpus is in niykpus, niykpus is in vamkpus, and vamkpus is in babbpus.\n\nBut again, this chain involves membership, not subset, so I cannot conclude that x is in babbpus because each step is membership, and membership is not transitive.\n\nFor example, from niykpus ∈ vamkpus and vamkpus ∈ babbpus, it does not mean niykpus ∈ babbpus. Similarly, yephpus ∈ niykpus and niykpus ∈ vamkpus does not mean yephpus ∈ vamkpus.\n\nSo, for x, which is in jiprpus, and jiprpus is in kepqpus, but kepqpus is in narypus, so x is not necessarily in narypus.\n\nTherefore, I cannot trace a path from x to babbpus through these membership chains.\n\nI need to see if there is any direct statement that links x to babbpus or to something that is in babbpus.\n\nBut from the information, x is jiprpus, and jiprpus is only said to be in kepqpus and raznpus. There is no mention of jiprpus being in anything else.\n\nvamkpus is in babbpus, but vamkpus is also howzpus, and howzpus is lotzpus, but no link to jiprpus.\n\nniykpus is vamkpus, but niykpus is also a category for yephpus, but yephpus is related to narypus, and narypus is related to kepqpus, but kepqpus is related to jiprpus only through membership, but since membership isn't transitive, jiprpus is not in kepqpus's categories? Let's think.\n\nkepqpus is a category that contains jiprpus, but kepqpus itself is a member of narypus, but that doesn't mean that jiprpus is a member of narypus.\n\nSimilarly, narypus is a member of yephpus, so narypus is in yephpus, but yephpus is in niykpus, so narypus is in niykpus? From narypus ∈ yephpus and yephpus ∈ niykpus, does it mean narypus ∈ niykpus? No, because yephpus ∈ niykpus means yephpus is a member of niykpus, so niykpus contains yephpus, but narypus is a member of yephpus, so narypus is inside yephpus, but yephpus is inside niykpus, so narypus is inside niykpus only if yephpus is a subset of niykpus, which is not stated. Since \"is\" means membership, yephpus is an element of niykpus, so niykpus is a set that has yephpus as an element, but yephpus itself is a set that has narypus as an element, so narypus is not necessarily an element of niykpus.\n\nThis is like sets within sets.\n\nSo, for x to be in babbpus, x must be directly stated to be in babbpus or in something that is in babbpus, but since membership isn't transitive, I need a direct chain of membership where each step implies that the element is in the set, but that requires that the sets are subsets, which isn't given.\n\nPerhaps in this context, \"A is B\" might imply that A is a subset of B or that B contains A? But the note says \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\", which could be interpreted as A is a subset of B or A is an element of B? The word \"contained in\" is ambiguous.\n\nLet's look at the note: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \"\n\nIn common usage, \"belongs to\" usually means membership, while \"contained in\" might mean subset.\n\nBut the note says \"or\", so it might be either interpretation.\n\nHowever, in the context of the statements, we have multiple categories, so it might be that \"is\" indicates membership.\n\nBut let's see the statements: \"vamkpus is babbpus and cibdpus\" which means vamkpus is in babbpus and in cibdpus.\n\n\"vamkpus is howzpus\" which means vamkpus is in howzpus.\n\nBut also \"niykpus is vamkpus\" which means niykpus is in vamkpus.\n\nAnd \"yephpus is niykpus\" so yephpus is in niykpus.\n\nBut from niykpus in vamkpus and yephpus in niykpus, if \"in\" means membership, then yephpus is not necessarily in vamkpus.\n\nHowever, if \"is\" means subset, then from niykpus is vamkpus, meaning niykpus subset of vamkpus, and yephpus is niykpus, meaning yephpus subset of niykpus, so yephpus subset of vamkpus, so yephpus is in vamkpus? But if \"is\" means subset, then \"yephpus is niykpus\" means yephpus ⊆ niykpus, and \"niykpus is vamkpus\" means niykpus ⊆ vamkpus, so indeed yephpus ⊆ vamkpus, so yephpus is contained in vamkpus, which might mean that every element of yephpus is in vamkpus, but since yephpus is a category, it might have elements, so if A is in yephpus, then A is in vamkpus.\n\nBut the note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B, so it might be that for categories, \"is\" could mean subset.\n\nBut let's see the first statement: \"howzpus is lotzpus\" – if howzpus is a category, then howzpus belongs to lotzpus, or howzpus is contained in lotzpus? Similarly, \"jiprpus is kepqpus\" – jiprpus might be an instance of kepqpus.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I need to see the question about x.\n\nx is jiprpus, and we want to know if x is babbpus or etc.\n\nbabbpus is a category that contains vamkpus.\n\nBut is there any way that jiprpus is in babbpus?\n\nFrom the information, jiprpus is in kepqpus, and kepqpus is in narypus, and narypus is in yephpus, and yephpus is in niykpus, and niykpus is in vamkpus, and vamkpus is in babbpus.\n\nIf \"is\" means membership, then this chain doesn't imply that jiprpus is in babbpus.\n\nBut if \"is\" means subset, then from kepqpus is narypus, if that means kepqpus ⊆ narypus, and since jiprpus is in kepqpus, so jiprpus is in narypus? But \"jiprpus is kepqpus\" means jiprpus ∈ kepqpus or jiprpus ⊆ kepqpus? The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B, so for \"jiprpus is kepqpus\", it could mean jiprpus ∈ kepqpus or jiprpus ⊆ kepqpus.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps in this context, since all things are called \"pus\", maybe they are all categories or all entities, but from the statements, some are used as entities and some as categories.\n\nLet's list all unique words: howzpus, lotzpus, jiprpus, kepqpus, raznpus, yephpus, niykpus, vamkpus, babbpus, cibdpus, rehkpus, xubppus, zeqdpus, x, narypus, yodcpus, hadnpus, yovvpus.\n\nx is probably an entity, and others might be categories.\n\nBut in \"x is jiprpus\", so jiprpus is a category that x belongs to.\n\nSimilarly, \"jiprpus is kepqpus\" so jiprpus belongs to kepqpus, so kepqpus is a category containing jiprpus.\n\nBut then \"kepqpus is narypus\" so kepqpus belongs to narypus, so narypus is a category containing kepqpus.\n\nSo, narypus is a category of categories? This is getting complex.\n\nFor the purpose of this question, I need to see if x is in babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is a category that contains vamkpus.\n\nvamkpus is also a category that contains niykpus, since niykpus is vamkpus.\n\nAnd niykpus contains yephpus, and yephpus contains narypus? From \"narypus is yephpus\" so narypus belongs to yephpus, so yephpus contains narypus.\n\nBut from \"yephpus is niykpus\" so yephpus belongs to niykpus, so niykpus contains yephpus.\n\nSimilarly, from \"niykpus is vamkpus\" so niykpus belongs to vamkpus, so vamkpus contains niykpus.\n\nAnd from \"vamkpus is babbpus\" so vamkpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus contains vamkpus.\n\nNow, x is jiprpus, and jiprpus belongs to kepqpus, and kepqpus belongs to narypus, and narypus belongs to yephpus, so from this, since narypus belongs to yephpus, and yephpus belongs to niykpus, but does that mean that narypus belongs to niykpus? Not directly, because belonging is not transitive.\n\nHowever, if we consider that categories might have elements, and if A belongs to B and B belongs to C, then A is an element of B, and B is an element of C, but A is not necessarily an element of C.\n\nSo for x, x is an element of jiprpus, and jiprpus is an element of kepqpus, so x is not an element of kepqpus unless jiprpus is a set that contains x, which it is, so x is in jiprpus, and jiprpus is in kepqpus, so x is in kepqpus? No: if jiprpus is a set and x is an element of jiprpus, and jiprpus is an element of kepqpus, then kepqpus is a set that contains jiprpus as an element, but does it contain x? Only if kepqpus also contains all elements of jiprpus, which is not stated. So, unless kepqpus is a superset of jiprpus, but from \"jiprpus is kepqpus\", it means jiprpus is an element of kepqpus, not that jiprpus is a subset of kepqpus.\n\nSo, in standard set theory, if x ∈ A and A ∈ B, then x may not be in B.\n\nTherefore, from x ∈ jiprpus and jiprpus ∈ kepqpus, we cannot conclude x ∈ kepqpus.\n\nSimilarly, for all other chains, we cannot conclude that x is in babbpus.\n\nSo, for x to be in babbpus, there must be a direct statement that x is in babbpus, or that something that contains x is in babbpus, but since membership isn't transitive, it doesn't work.\n\nMoreover, babcpus and babppus are not mentioned at all, so there is no information about them. Therefore, we cannot say that x is in them.\n\nSo, the answer should be unknown.\n\nBut let's see if there is any direct link.\n\nFrom the statements, we have vamkpus is howzpus, and howzpus is lotzpus, but no link to jiprpus.\n\nAlso, niykpus is vamkpus, but niykpus is also a category for yephpus, but yephpus is for narypus, and narypus is for kepqpus, but kepqpus is for jiprpus, but again, not direct.\n\nSo, I think it is unknown.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" so since babcpus and babppus are not mentioned, definitely unknown for them, and for babbpus, no link, so unknown.\n\nSo, final answer should be unknown.",

Let's think.\n\nkepqpus is a category that contains jiprpus, but kepqpus itself is a member of narypus, but that doesn't mean that jiprpus is a member of narypus.\n\nSimilarly, narypus is a member of yephpus, so narypus is in yephpus, but yephpus is in niykpus, so narypus is in niykpus? From narypus ∈ yephpus and yephpus ∈ niykpus, does it mean narypus ∈ niykpus? No, because yephpus ∈ niykpus means yephpus is a member of niykpus, so niykpus contains yephpus, but narypus is a member of yephpus, so narypus is inside yephpus, but yephpus is inside niykpus, so narypus is inside niykpus only if yephpus is a subset of niykpus, which is not stated.

The word \"contained in\" is ambiguous.\n\nLet's look at the note: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \"\n\nIn common usage, \"belongs to\" usually means membership, while \"contained in\" might mean subset.\n\nBut the note says \"or\", so it might be either interpretation.\n\nHowever, in the context of the statements, we have multiple categories, so it might be that \"is\" indicates membership.\n\nBut let's see the statements: \"vamkpus is babbpus and cibdpus\" which means vamkpus is in babbpus and in cibdpus.\n\n\"vamkpus is howzpus\" which means vamkpus is in howzpus.\n\nBut also \"niykpus is vamkpus\" which means niykpus is in vamkpus.\n\nAnd \"yephpus is niykpus\" so yephpus is in niykpus.\n\nBut from niykpus in vamkpus and yephpus in niykpus, if \"in\" means membership, then yephpus is not necessarily in vamkpus.\n\nHowever, if \"is\" means subset, then from niykpus is vamkpus, meaning niykpus subset of vamkpus, and yephpus is niykpus, meaning yephpus subset of niykpus, so yephpus subset of vamkpus, so yephpus is in vamkpus? But if \"is\" means subset, then \"yephpus is niykpus\" means yephpus ⊆ niykpus, and \"niykpus is vamkpus\" means niykpus ⊆ vamkpus, so indeed yephpus ⊆ vamkpus, so yephpus is contained in vamkpus, which might mean that every element of yephpus is in vamkpus, but since yephpus is a category, it might have elements, so if A is in yephpus, then A is in vamkpus.\n\nBut the note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B, so it might be that for categories, \"is\" could mean subset.\n\nBut let's see the first statement: \"howzpus is lotzpus\" – if howzpus is a category, then howzpus belongs to lotzpus, or howzpus is contained in lotzpus? Similarly, \"jiprpus is kepqpus\" – jiprpus might be an instance of kepqpus.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I need to see the question about x.\n\nx is jiprpus, and we want to know if x is babbpus or etc.\n\nbabbpus is a category that contains vamkpus.\n\nBut is there any way that jiprpus is in babbpus?\n\nFrom the information, jiprpus is in kepqpus, and kepqpus is in narypus, and narypus is in yephpus, and yephpus is in niykpus, and niykpus is in vamkpus, and vamkpus is in babbpus.\n\nIf \"is\" means membership, then this chain doesn't imply that jiprpus is in babbpus.\n\nBut if \"is\" means subset, then from kepqpus is narypus, if that means kepqpus ⊆ narypus, and since jiprpus is in kepqpus, so jiprpus is in narypus? But \"jiprpus is kepqpus\" means jiprpus ∈ kepqpus or jiprpus ⊆ kepqpus? The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B, so for \"jiprpus is kepqpus\", it could mean jiprpus ∈ kepqpus or jiprpus ⊆ kepqpus.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps in this context, since all things are called \"pus\", maybe they are all categories or all entities, but from the statements, some are used as entities and some as categories.\n\nLet's list all unique words: howzpus, lotzpus, jiprpus, kepqpus, raznpus, yephpus, niykpus, vamkpus, babbpus, cibdpus, rehkpus, xubppus, zeqdpus, x, narypus, yodcpus, hadnpus, yovvpus.\n\nx is probably an entity, and others might be categories.\n\nBut in \"x is jiprpus\", so jiprpus is a category that x belongs to.\n\nSimilarly, \"jiprpus is kepqpus\" so jiprpus belongs to kepqpus, so kepqpus is a category containing jiprpus.\n\nBut then \"kepqpus is narypus\" so kepqpus belongs to narypus, so narypus is a category containing kepqpus.\n\nSo, narypus is a category of categories? This is getting complex.\n\nFor the purpose of this question, I need to see if x is in babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is a category that contains vamkpus.\n\nvamkpus is also a category that contains niykpus, since niykpus is vamkpus.\n\nAnd niykpus contains yephpus, and yephpus contains narypus? From \"narypus is yephpus\" so narypus belongs to yephpus, so yephpus contains narypus.\n\nBut from \"yephpus is niykpus\" so yephpus belongs to niykpus, so niykpus contains yephpus.\n\nSimilarly, from \"niykpus is vamkpus\" so niykpus belongs to vamkpus, so vamkpus contains niykpus.\n\nAnd from \"vamkpus is babbpus\" so vamkpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus contains vamkpus.\n\nNow, x is jiprpus, and jiprpus belongs to kepqpus, and kepqpus belongs to narypus, and narypus belongs to yephpus, so from this, since narypus belongs to yephpus, and yephpus belongs to niykpus, but does that mean that narypus belongs to niykpus? Not directly, because belonging is not transitive.\n\nHowever, if we consider that categories might have elements, and if A belongs to B and B belongs to C, then A is an element of B, and B is an element of C, but A is not necessarily an element of C.\n\nSo for x, x is an element of jiprpus, and jiprpus is an element of kepqpus, so x is not an element of kepqpus unless jiprpus is a set that contains x, which it is, so x is in jiprpus, and jiprpus is in kepqpus, so x is in kepqpus? No: if jiprpus is a set and x is an element of jiprpus, and jiprpus is an element of kepqpus, then kepqpus is a set that contains jiprpus as an element, but does it contain x? Only if kepqpus also contains all elements of jiprpus, which is not stated. So, unless kepqpus is a superset of jiprpus, but from \"jiprpus is kepqpus\", it means jiprpus is an element of kepqpus, not that jiprpus is a subset of kepqpus.\n\nSo, in standard set theory, if x ∈ A and A ∈ B, then x may not be in B.\n\nTherefore, from x ∈ jiprpus and jiprpus ∈ kepqpus, we cannot conclude x ∈ kepqpus.\n\nSimilarly, for all other chains, we cannot conclude that x is in babbpus.\n\nSo, for x to be in babbpus, there must be a direct statement that x is in babbpus, or that something that contains x is in babbpus, but since membership isn't transitive, it doesn't work.\n\nMoreover, babcpus and babppus are not mentioned at all, so there is no information about them. Therefore, we cannot say that x is in them.\n\nSo, the answer should be unknown.\n\nBut let's see if there is any direct link.\n\nFrom the statements, we have vamkpus is howzpus, and howzpus is lotzpus, but no link to jiprpus.\n\nAlso, niykpus is vamkpus, but niykpus is also a category for yephpus, but yephpus is for narypus, and narypus is for kepqpus, but kepqpus is for jiprpus, but again, not direct.\n\nSo, I think it is unknown.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" so since babcpus and babppus are not mentioned, definitely unknown for them, and for babbpus, no link, so unknown.\n\nSo, final answer should be unknown.",

Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8.

If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

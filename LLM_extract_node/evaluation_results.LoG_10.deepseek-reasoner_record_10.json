  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus. The given information says that x is bimfpus. So, I have to find out if bimfpus is related to babgpus through the chain of \"is\" statements.\n\nI recall that \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, I need to trace the connections from x to babgpus.\n\nStart with x: x is bimfpus.\n\nNow, I need to see where bimfpus leads. Looking at the information, bimfpus is mentioned only once: \"x is bimfpus.\" But I need to know what bimfpus is. I see that \"bimfpus is hoxppus\". Let me find that.\n\nScanning through the information, I find: \"bimfpus is hoxppus\". Yes, it's there: \"bimfpus is hoxppus\". So, x is bimfpus, and bimfpus is hoxppus, so x is hoxppus.\n\nNow, what is hoxppus? From the information: \"hoxppus is zaswpus\". So, hoxppus is zaswpus, so x is zaswpus.\n\nNext, what is zaswpus? \"zaswpus is nidvpus and lotxpus\". But since it's \"is\", it might mean that zaswpus belongs to nidvpus and lotxpus, or it contains them? The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B. So, if zaswpus is nidvpus and lotxpus, it could mean that zaswpus is a subset of nidvpus and lotxpus, or that it is composed of them. But for the purpose of this question, I think we need to see if x is babgpus, so we need to see if babgpus is ever connected to x through these chains.\n\nPerhaps I should look for babgpus directly. Where is babgpus mentioned? I see \"wujjpus is babgpus and zeskpus\". So, babgpus is part of wujjpus? Or wujjpus belongs to babgpus? The statement is \"wujjpus is babgpus and zeskpus\", which means wujjpus is contained in babgpus and zeskpus, or wujjpus belongs to babgpus and zeskpus. But based on the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so wujjpus belongs to babgpus and zeskpus. That means babgpus is a category that contains wujjpus.\n\nBut I need to know if x is babgpus, meaning x belongs to babgpus.\n\nSo, from x, I have x is zaswpus. Now, zaswpus is nidvpus and lotxpus. But I need to connect to babgpus.\n\nI also have \"nidvpus is yewjpus\" and \"nidvpus is qufypus\". From \"zaswpus is nidvpus\", so zaswpus belongs to nidvpus, so x belongs to nidvpus.\n\nBut nidvpus is yewjpus? Let's see: \"nidvpus is yewjpus\" and also \"nidvpus is qufypus\". So nidvpus belongs to yewjpus and to qufypus.\n\nBut I need babgpus. babgpus is related to wujjpus.\n\nWhere is wujjpus? I see \"wujjpus is nenmpus and jiljpus\" and also \"wujjpus is sewbpus and nixwpus\" and \"wujjpus is babgpus and zeskpus\". So wujjpus belongs to babgpus.\n\nBut for x to be babgpus, x must belong to babgpus, meaning that babgpus must contain x. But from above, babgpus contains wujjpus, so if x is wujjpus or if x is contained in wujjpus, then x might belong to babgpus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is wujjpus or related.\n\nFrom x, I have x is nidvpus (since zaswpus is nidvpus).\n\nnidvpus is yewjpus: \"nidvpus is yewjpus\". So x is yewjpus.\n\nyewjpus is jopfpus: \"yewjpus is jopfpus\". So x is jopfpus.\n\njopfpus is hiwjpus: \"jopfpus is hiwjpus\". So x is hiwjpus.\n\nhiwjpus is tobfpus: \"hiwjpus is tobfpus\". But I don't know what tobfpus is yet. I need to connect to wujjpus.\n\nI also have nidvpus is qufypus: \"nidvpus is qufypus\". So x is qufypus.\n\nqufypus is nejqpus and gabkpus: \"qufypus is nejqpus and gabkpus\". So x is nejqpus and gabkpus.\n\nnejqpus is faqmpus: \"nejqpus is faqmpus\". So x is faqmpus.\n\nfaqmpus is nurqpus: \"faqmpus is nurqpus\". So x is nurqpus.\n\nnurqpus is vokvpus: \"nurqpus is vokvpus\". So x is vokvpus.\n\nvokvpus is zezqpus: \"vokvpus is zezqpus\". So x is zezqpus.\n\nzezqpus is xuwvpus: \"zezqpus is xuwvpus\". So x is xuwvpus.\n\nxuwvpus is joqfpus and qijspus and fehlpus: \"xuwvpus is joqfpus and qijspus and fehlpus\". So x is joqfpus, etc.\n\njoqfpus is nejwpus: \"joqfpus is nejwpus\". So x is nejwpus.\n\nnejwpus is xescpus and suchpus: \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\". So x is xescpus and suchpus.\n\nxescpus is vaqhpus and cemvpus and muwxpus: but also, from earlier, \"xescpus is ladxpus and gepypus\". So x is ladxpus.\n\nladxpus is rubrpus and bexmpus: \"ladxpus is rubrpus and bexmpus\". So x is rubrpus.\n\nrubrpus is woqppus: \"rubrpus is woqppus\". So x is woqppus.\n\nwoqppus is xebbpus: \"woqppus is xebbpus\". So x is xebbpus.\n\nxebbpus is tomspus: \"xebbpus is tomspus\". So x is tomspus.\n\ntomspus is puzjpus and vaxspus: \"tomspus is puzjpus and vaxspus\". So x is puzjpus.\n\npuzjpus is liqqpus: \"puzjpus is liqqpus\". So x is liqqpus.\n\nliqqpus is yacypus: \"liqqpus is yacypus\". So x is yacypus.\n\nyacypus is xujdpus: \"yacypus is xujdpus\". So x is xujdpus.\n\nxujdpus is tiqxpus: \"xujdpus is tiqxpus\". So x is tiqxpus.\n\ntiqxpus is cowxpus: \"tiqxpus is cowxpus\". So x is cowxpus.\n\ncowxpus is rupppus: \"cowxpus is rupppus\". So x is rupppus.\n\nBut I don't see any connection to wujjpus or babgpus yet. This seems like a long chain, but I need to find babgpus.\n\nI also have suchpus from nejwpus: x is suchpus.\n\nsuchpus is vadlpus and gamqpus: \"suchpus is vadlpus and gamqpus\"? Wait, no, \"muchpus is vadlpus and gamqpus\", but I have suchpus from nejwpus: \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\", and suchpus is not directly defined here. Let's see the information.\n\nI see \"muchpus is vadlpus and gamqpus\", but I have suchpus, which might be a typo or I misread. From \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\", but in the information, I think it's \"suchpus\" but let's check the original.\n\nLooking back: \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\" â€“ but in the given information, I don't see \"suchpus\" defined separately. I see \"muchpus\" which is different. Perhaps I confused muchpus with suchpus.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\" â€“ but in the list, I have \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\" from the statement? No, let's find where nejwpus is defined.\n\nFrom earlier: \"joqfpus is nejwpus\" and then \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\" â€“ but I need to see if \"suchpus\" is mentioned elsewhere.\n\nActually, in the given information, I see \"muchpus is vadlpus and gamqpus\" but not \"suchpus\". Perhaps it's a mistake. Let's look at the original text.\n\nThe given information has: \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\" â€“ but I think \"suchpus\" might be \"muchpus\" or something else. Let's read the entire given information string.\n\nI see: \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\" â€“ but in the list, there is no \"suchpus\" defined. I see \"muchpus\" which is defined as \"muchpus is vadlpus and gamqpus\". But \"suchpus\" is not listed. Perhaps it's a typo, and it should be \"muchpus\"? But let's see the context.\n\nAnother thought: from \"xescpus is ladxpus and gepypus\" and \"ladxpus is rubrpus and bexmpus\" etc., but for suchpus, I need to find what it is.\n\nPerhaps I have to consider that \"suchpus\" is part of the chain, but since it's not defined, I might need to ignore this path for now.\n\nI recall that I also have another path from x. Since x is nidvpus, and nidvpus is qufypus, but I also have nidvpus is yewjpus, which I followed to jopfpus, etc., but that didn't lead to babgpus.\n\nI need to find where babgpus is mentioned. babgpus is associated with wujjpus: \"wujjpus is babgpus and zeskpus\" meaning wujjpus belongs to babgpus.\n\nSo, if I can find if x is wujjpus, then x belongs to babgpus.\n\nBut is x wujjpus? From my current chains, I don't see x being wujjpus.\n\nI also have \"woybpus is wujjpus and gefdpus\" from \"yahqpus is woybpus\" and \"modnpus is yahqpus and rutppus and wijfpus\" but let's see if I can connect to modnpus.\n\nFrom earlier, I had x is tiqxpus, and tiqxpus is huhkpus: \"tiqxpus is huhkpus\" so x is huhkpus.\n\nhuhkpus is jemppus: \"huhkpus is jemppus\" so x is jemppus.\n\njemppus

But since it's \"is\", it might mean that zaswpus belongs to nidvpus and lotxpus, or it contains them? The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B. So, if zaswpus is nidvpus and lotxpus, it could mean that zaswpus is a subset of nidvpus and lotxpus, or that it is composed of them. But for the purpose of this question, I think we need to see if x is babgpus, so we need to see if babgpus is ever connected to x through these chains.\n\nPerhaps I should look for babgpus directly. Where is babgpus mentioned? I see \"wujjpus is babgpus and zeskpus\". So, babgpus is part of wujjpus? Or wujjpus belongs to babgpus? The statement is \"wujjpus is babgpus and zeskpus\", which means wujjpus is contained in babgpus and zeskpus, or wujjpus belongs to babgpus and zeskpus. But based on the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so wujjpus belongs to babgpus and zeskpus. That means babgpus is a category that contains wujjpus.\n\nBut I need to know if x is babgpus, meaning x belongs to babgpus.\n\nSo, from x, I have x is zaswpus. Now, zaswpus is nidvpus and lotxpus. But I need to connect to babgpus.\n\nI also have \"nidvpus is yewjpus\" and \"nidvpus is qufypus\". From \"zaswpus is nidvpus\", so zaswpus belongs to nidvpus, so x belongs to nidvpus.\n\nBut nidvpus is yewjpus? Let's see: \"nidvpus is yewjpus\" and also \"nidvpus is qufypus\". So nidvpus belongs to yewjpus and to qufypus.\n\nBut I need babgpus. babgpus is related to wujjpus.\n\nWhere is wujjpus? I see \"wujjpus is nenmpus and jiljpus\" and also \"wujjpus is sewbpus and nixwpus\" and \"wujjpus is babgpus and zeskpus\". So wujjpus belongs to babgpus.\n\nBut for x to be babgpus, x must belong to babgpus, meaning that babgpus must contain x. But from above, babgpus contains wujjpus, so if x is wujjpus or if x is contained in wujjpus, then x might belong to babgpus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is wujjpus or related.\n\nFrom x, I have x is nidvpus (since zaswpus is nidvpus).\n\nnidvpus is yewjpus: \"nidvpus is yewjpus\". So x is yewjpus.\n\nyewjpus is jopfpus: \"yewjpus is jopfpus\". So x is jopfpus.\n\njopfpus is hiwjpus: \"jopfpus is hiwjpus\". So x is hiwjpus.\n\nhiwjpus is tobfpus: \"hiwjpus is tobfpus\". But I don't know what tobfpus is yet. I need to connect to wujjpus.\n\nI also have nidvpus is qufypus: \"nidvpus is qufypus\". So x is qufypus.\n\nqufypus is nejqpus and gabkpus: \"qufypus is nejqpus and gabkpus\". So x is nejqpus and gabkpus.\n\nnejqpus is faqmpus: \"nejqpus is faqmpus\". So x is faqmpus.\n\nfaqmpus is nurqpus: \"faqmpus is nurqpus\". So x is nurqpus.\n\nnurqpus is vokvpus: \"nurqpus is vokvpus\". So x is vokvpus.\n\nvokvpus is zezqpus: \"vokvpus is zezqpus\". So x is zezqpus.\n\nzezqpus is xuwvpus: \"zezqpus is xuwvpus\". So x is xuwvpus.\n\nxuwvpus is joqfpus and qijspus and fehlpus: \"xuwvpus is joqfpus and qijspus and fehlpus\". So x is joqfpus, etc.\n\njoqfpus is nejwpus: \"joqfpus is nejwpus\". So x is nejwpus.\n\nnejwpus is xescpus and suchpus: \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\". So x is xescpus and suchpus.\n\nxescpus is vaqhpus and cemvpus and muwxpus: but also, from earlier, \"xescpus is ladxpus and gepypus\". So x is ladxpus.\n\nladxpus is rubrpus and bexmpus: \"ladxpus is rubrpus and bexmpus\". So x is rubrpus.\n\nrubrpus is woqppus: \"rubrpus is woqppus\". So x is woqppus.\n\nwoqppus is xebbpus: \"woqppus is xebbpus\". So x is xebbpus.\n\nxebbpus is tomspus: \"xebbpus is tomspus\". So x is tomspus.\n\ntomspus is puzjpus and vaxspus: \"tomspus is puzjpus and vaxspus\". So x is puzjpus.\n\npuzjpus is liqqpus: \"puzjpus is liqqpus\". So x is liqqpus.\n\nliqqpus is yacypus: \"liqqpus is yacypus\". So x is yacypus.\n\nyacypus is xujdpus: \"yacypus is xujdpus\". So x is xujdpus.\n\nxujdpus is tiqxpus: \"xujdpus is tiqxpus\". So x is tiqxpus.\n\ntiqxpus is cowxpus: \"tiqxpus is cowxpus\". So x is cowxpus.\n\ncowxpus is rupppus: \"cowxpus is rupppus\". So x is rupppus.\n\nBut I don't see any connection to wujjpus or babgpus yet. This seems like a long chain, but I need to find babgpus.\n\nI also have suchpus from nejwpus: x is suchpus.\n\nsuchpus is vadlpus and gamqpus: \"suchpus is vadlpus and gamqpus\"? Wait, no, \"muchpus is vadlpus and gamqpus\", but I have suchpus from nejwpus: \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\", and suchpus is not directly defined here. Let's see the information.\n\nI see \"muchpus is vadlpus and gamqpus\", but I have suchpus, which might be a typo or I misread. From \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\", but in the information, I think it's \"suchpus\" but let's check the original.\n\nLooking back: \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\" â€“ but in the given information, I don't see \"suchpus\" defined separately. I see \"muchpus\" which is different. Perhaps I confused muchpus with suchpus.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\" â€“ but in the list, I have \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\" from the statement? No, let's find where nejwpus is defined.\n\nFrom earlier: \"joqfpus is nejwpus\" and then \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\" â€“ but I need to see if \"suchpus\" is mentioned elsewhere.\n\nActually, in the given information, I see \"muchpus is vadlpus and gamqpus\" but not \"suchpus\". Perhaps it's a mistake. Let's look at the original text.\n\nThe given information has: \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\" â€“ but I think \"suchpus\" might be \"muchpus\" or something else. Let's read the entire given information string.\n\nI see: \"nejwpus is xescpus and suchpus\" â€“ but in the list, there is no \"suchpus\" defined. I see \"muchpus\" which is defined as \"muchpus is vadlpus and gamqpus\". But \"suchpus\" is not listed. Perhaps it's a typo, and it should be \"muchpus\"? But let's see the context.\n\nAnother thought: from \"xescpus is ladxpus and gepypus\" and \"ladxpus is rubrpus and bexmpus\" etc., but for suchpus, I need to find what it is.\n\nPerhaps I have to consider that \"suchpus\" is part of the chain, but since it's not defined, I might need to ignore this path for now.\n\nI recall that I also have another path from x. Since x is nidvpus, and nidvpus is qufypus, but I also have nidvpus is yewjpus, which I followed to jopfpus, etc., but that didn't lead to babgpus.\n\nI need to find where babgpus is mentioned. babgpus is associated with wujjpus: \"wujjpus is babgpus and zeskpus\" meaning wujjpus belongs to babgpus.\n\nSo, if I can find if x is wujjpus, then x belongs to babgpus.\n\nBut is x wujjpus? From my current chains, I don't see x being wujjpus.\n\nI also have \"woybpus is wujjpus and gefdpus\" from \"yahqpus is woybpus\" and \"modnpus is yahqpus and rutppus and wijfpus\" but let's see if I can connect to modnpus.\n\nFrom earlier, I had x is tiqxpus, and tiqxpus is huhkpus: \"tiqxpus is huhkpus\" so x is huhkpus.\n\nhuhkpus is jemppus: \"huhkpus is jemppus\" so x is jemppus.\n\njemppus

Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" â†’ \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" â†’ \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" â†’ \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (â†’), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"Aâ†’Bâ†’Câ†’D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x â†’ A â†’ B â†’ C\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"xâ†’Aâ†’Bâ†’C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" â†’ Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" â†’ Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" â†’ Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" â†’ Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

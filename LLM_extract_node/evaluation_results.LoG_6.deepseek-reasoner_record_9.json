  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is in the categories babgpus, babrpus, and babspus. The question is whether x belongs to all three of these categories.\n\nFrom the given information, I know that x is yujkpus. So, x = yujkpus.\n\nNow, I need to trace what yujkpus is connected to. From the information: yujkpus is gajnpus and sefxpus.\n\nSo, yujkpus is gajnpus and sefxpus, meaning yujkpus belongs to gajnpus and sefxpus categories.\n\nNext, gajnpus is hizspus. So, gajnpus belongs to hizspus.\n\nThen, hizspus is fikvpus and yaltpus. So, hizspus belongs to fikvpus and yaltpus.\n\nNow, fikvpus is ferypus and xewtpus. So, fikvpus belongs to ferypus and xewtpus.\n\nAlso, ferypus is ceslpus and zihdpus. So, ferypus belongs to ceslpus and zihdpus.\n\nBut I need to get to babgpus, babrpus, and babspus. So, I should look for connections to these categories.\n\nLet me list out what I know about these bab categories.\n\nFirst, babgpus: from the information, nalgpus is pittpus and also nalgpus is babgpus. So, nalgpus belongs to babgpus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is connected to nalgpus or babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, babrpus: leztpus is babrpus. And leztpus is also pervpus, but that might not help directly.\n\nbabspus: buffpus is babspus and tuvkpus. So, buffpus belongs to babspus.\n\nSo, I need to see if x is connected to buffpus or leztpus or nalgpus.\n\nSince x is yujkpus, and yujkpus is gajnpus, and gajnpus is hizspus, and hizspus is fikvpus, and fikvpus is ferypus, and ferypus is ceslpus.\n\nSo, ultimately, yujkpus is connected to ceslpus through this chain.\n\nBut let's confirm: yujkpus -> gajnpus -> hizspus -> fikvpus -> ferypus -> ceslpus.\n\nSo, yujkpus belongs to ceslpus? Not directly, but through the categories. Since each \"is\" means belonging, if A is B, and B is C, then A is C, meaning A belongs to C.\n\nIn this context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so it should be transitive. If A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nSimilarly, if A is B and B is C and D, then A is C and D.\n\nSo, from above, yujkpus is gajnpus, and gajnpus is hizspus, so yujkpus is hizspus.\n\nThen hizspus is fikvpus, so yujkpus is fikvpus.\n\nThen fikvpus is ferypus, so yujkpus is ferypus.\n\nThen ferypus is ceslpus, so yujkpus is ceslpus.\n\nThus, x is ceslpus.\n\nNow, from the information, ceslpus is gahxpus. Also, ceslpus is serlpus and nehhpus.\n\nBut we need babgpus, etc.\n\nNow, ceslpus is also wenfpus and vuhlpus? From: ceslpus is wenfpus and vuhlpus. But that might mean ceslpus belongs to wenfpus and vuhlpus, or does it mean ceslpus has categories wenfpus and vuhlpus? I think based on the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if ceslpus is wenfpus, that means ceslpus belongs to wenfpus, so wenfpus is a category that contains ceslpus.\n\nBut let's read carefully: \"ceslpus is wenfpus and vuhlpus\" – this means ceslpus belongs to wenfpus and also to vuhlpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"ceslpus is serlpus and nehhpus\" – so ceslpus belongs to serlpus and nehhpus.\n\nBut serlpus is a category, and ceslpus belongs to it.\n\nNow, we also have that serlpus is qojjpus and kuhrpus.\n\nBut let's go back to babgpus.\n\nnalgpus is babgpus. And kuhrpus is nalgpus and pasgpus. So kuhrpus belongs to nalgpus and pasgpus.\n\nBut serlpus is kuhrpus, so serlpus belongs to kuhrpus.\n\nAnd since ceslpus is serlpus, so ceslpus belongs to serlpus, which belongs to kuhrpus, which belongs to nalgpus, which belongs to babgpus.\n\nSo, let's trace this chain.\n\nceslpus is serlpus (so ceslpus belongs to serlpus).\n\nserlpus is kuhrpus (so serlpus belongs to kuhrpus).\n\nkuhrpus is nalgpus and pasgpus (so kuhrpus belongs to nalgpus).\n\nnalgpus is babgpus (so nalgpus belongs to babgpus).\n\nTherefore, since ceslpus belongs to serlpus, which belongs to kuhrpus, which belongs to nalgpus, which belongs to babgpus, so ceslpus belongs to babgpus.\n\nThus, x is ceslpus, so x belongs to babgpus.\n\nSo, x is babgpus.\n\nNow, we need x to be babrpus and babspus.\n\nNext, babrpus: leztpus is babrpus.\n\nWe need to see if x is connected to leztpus.\n\nFrom above, x is ceslpus, and ceslpus is also gahxpus? ceslpus is gahxpus, meaning ceslpus belongs to gahxpus.\n\nBut gahxpus is pezgpus and wedtpus.\n\npezgpus is doscpus.\n\ndoscpus is gafcpus and colqpus.\n\ngafcpus is lotrpus.\n\nlotrpus is nudjpus.\n\nnudjpus is hunzpus.\n\nhunzpus is gacqpus.\n\ngacqpus is buffpus.\n\nbuffpus is babspus and tuvkpus.\n\nSo, this chain might lead to babspus, but we need babrpus first.\n\nFor babrpus, we have leztpus is babrpus.\n\nAnd from the information, sopbpus is leztpus and veytpus.\n\nBut sopbpus is related to dildpus? dildpus is sopbpus.\n\nAnd tophpus is dildpus.\n\nAlso, wudtpus is tophpus and luwlpus.\n\nAnd wenfpus is pixvpus.\n\nBut ceslpus is wenfpus and vuhlpus, so ceslpus belongs to wenfpus.\n\nwenfpus is pixvpus, so wenfpus belongs to pixvpus.\n\npixvpus is wudtpus, so pixvpus belongs to wudtpus.\n\nwudtpus is tophpus and luwlpus, so wudtpus belongs to tophpus.\n\ntophpus is dildpus, so tophpus belongs to dildpus.\n\ndildpus is sopbpus, so dildpus belongs to sopbpus.\n\nsopbpus is leztpus and veytpus, so sopbpus belongs to leztpus.\n\nleztpus is babrpus, so leztpus belongs to babrpus.\n\nTherefore, since ceslpus belongs to wenfpus, which belongs to pixvpus, which belongs to wudtpus, which belongs to tophpus, which belongs to dildpus, which belongs to sopbpus, which belongs to leztpus, which belongs to babrpus, so ceslpus belongs to babrpus.\n\nThus, x is ceslpus, so x belongs to babrpus.\n\nSo, x is babrpus.\n\nNow, we need x to be babspus.\n\nbabspus: buffpus is babspus and tuvkpus.\n\nSo, we need to see if x is connected to buffpus.\n\nFrom earlier, we have hunzpus is gacqpus.\n\ngacqpus is buffpus.\n\nAnd from the chain above, we have lotrpus is nudjpus.\n\nnudjpus is hunzpus.\n\nhunzpus is gacqpus.\n\ngacqpus is buffpus.\n\nBut we need to connect to ceslpus.\n\nceslpus is gahxpus.\n\ngahxpus is pezgpus and wedtpus.\n\npezgpus is doscpus.\n\ndoscpus is gafcpus and colqpus.\n\ngafcpus is lotrpus.\n\nSo, let's see: ceslpus belongs to gahxpus.\n\ngahxpus belongs to pezgpus? No: gahxpus is pezgpus and wedtpus, meaning gahxpus belongs to pezgpus and wedtpus.\n\nSo, gahxpus belongs to pezgpus.\n\npezgpus is doscpus, so pezgpus belongs to doscpus.\n\ndoscpus is gafcpus and colqpus, so doscpus belongs to gafcpus.\n\ngafcpus is lotrpus, so gafcpus belongs to lotrpus.\n\nlotrpus is nudjpus, so lotrpus belongs to nudjpus.\n\nnudjpus is hunzpus, so nudjpus belongs to hunzpus.\n\nhunzpus is gacqpus, so hunzpus belongs to gacqpus.\n\ngacqpus is buffpus, so gacqpus belongs to buffpus.\n\nbuffpus is babspus, so buffpus belongs to babspus.\n\nTherefore, since ceslpus belongs to gahxpus, which belongs to pezgpus, which belongs to doscpus, which belongs to gafcpus, which belongs to lotrpus, which belongs to nudjpus, which belongs to hunzpus, which belongs to gacqpus, which belongs to buffpus, which belongs to babspus, so ceslpus belongs to babspus.\n\nThus, x is ceslpus, so x belongs to babspus.\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus, babrpus, and babspus.\n\nSo, the statement is true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any missing links or contradictions.\n\nWe have x is yujkpus, and we derived that yujkpus is ceslpus through the chain: yujkpus -> gajnpus -> hizspus -> fikvpus -> ferypus -> ceslpus.\n\nIs this chain correct? Let's see:\n\nyujkpus is gajnpus and sefxpus. So yujkpus belongs to gajnpus.\n\ngajnpus is hizspus. So gajnpus belongs to hizspus, thus yujkpus belongs to hizspus.\n\nhizspus is fikvpus and yaltpus. So hizspus belongs to fikvpus, thus yujkpus belongs to fikvpus.\n\nfikvpus is ferypus and xewtpus. So fikvpus belongs to ferypus, thus yujkpus belongs to ferypus.\n\nferypus is ceslpus and zihdpus. So ferypus belongs to ceslpus, thus yujkpus belongs to ceslpus.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nThen for babgpus: ceslpus is serlpus (belongs to serlpus).\n\nserlpus is kuhrpus (belongs to kuhrpus).\n\nkuhrpus is nalgpus and pasgpus (belongs to nalgpus).\n\nnalgpus is babgpus (belongs to babgpus).\n\nSo ceslpus belongs to babgpus.\n\nFor babrpus: ceslpus is wenfpus and vuhlpus (belongs to wenfpus).\n\nwenfpus is pixvpus (belongs to pixvpus).\n\npixvpus is wudtpus (belongs to wudtpus).\n\nwudtpus is tophpus and luwlpus (belongs to tophpus).\n\ntophpus is dildpus (belongs to dildpus).\n\ndildpus is sopbpus (belongs to sopbpus).\n\nsopbpus is leztpus and veytpus (belongs to leztpus).\n\nleztpus is babrpus (belongs to babrpus).\n\nSo ceslpus belongs to babrpus.\n\nFor babspus: ceslpus is gahxpus (belongs to gahxpus).\n\ngahxpus is pezgpus and wedtpus (belongs to pezgpus).\n\npezgpus is doscpus (belongs to doscpus).\n\ndoscpus is gafcpus and colqpus (belongs to gafcpus).\n\ngafcpus is lotrpus (belongs to lotrpus).\n\nlotrpus is nudjpus (belongs to nudjpus).\n\nnudjpus is hunzpus (belongs to hunzpus).\n\nhunzpus is gacqpus (belongs to gacqpus).\n\ngacqpus is buffpus (belongs to buffpus).\n\nbuffpus is babspus and tuvkpus (belongs to babspus).\n\nSo ceslpus belongs to babspus.\n\nTherefore, x is all three.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.",

    "Also, ceslpus is serlpus and nehhpus.",
    "But we need babgpus, etc.",
    "Now, ceslpus is also wenfpus and vuhlpus?",
    "From: ceslpus is wenfpus and vuhlpus.",
    "But that might mean ceslpus belongs to wenfpus and vuhlpus, or does it mean ceslpus has categories wenfpus and vuhlpus?",
    "I think based on the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if ceslpus is wenfpus, that means ceslpus belongs to wenfpus, so wenfpus is a category that contains ceslpus.",
    "But let's read carefully: \"ceslpus is wenfpus and vuhlpus\" – this means ceslpus belongs to wenfpus and also to vuhlpus.",
    "Similarly, \"ceslpus is serlpus and nehhpus\" – so ceslpus belongs to serlpus and nehhpus.",
    "But serlpus is a category, and ceslpus belongs to it.",
    "Now, we also have that serlpus is qojjpus and kuhrpus.",
    "But let's go back to babgpus.",
    "nalgpus is babgpus.",
    "And kuhrpus is nalgpus and pasgpus.",
    "So kuhrpus belongs to nalgpus and pasgpus.",
    "But serlpus is kuhrpus, so serlpus belongs to kuhrpus.",
    "And since ceslpus is serlpus, so ceslpus belongs to serlpus, which belongs to kuhrpus, which belongs to nalgpus, which belongs to babgpus.",

    "Therefore, since ceslpus belongs to serlpus, which belongs to kuhrpus, which belongs to nalgpus, which belongs to babgpus, so ceslpus belongs to babgpus.",
    "Thus, x is ceslpus, so x belongs to babgpus.",
    "So, x is babgpus.",

    "Next, babrpus: leztpus is babrpus.",
    "We need to see if x is connected to leztpus.",
    "From above, x is ceslpus, and ceslpus is also gahxpus?",

    "For babrpus, we have leztpus is babrpus.",
    "And from the information, sopbpus is leztpus and veytpus.",
    "But sopbpus is related to dildpus?",
    "dildpus is sopbpus.",
    "And tophpus is dildpus.",
    "Also, wudtpus is tophpus and luwlpus.",

    "gahxpus belongs to pezgpus?",
    "No: gahxpus is pezgpus and wedtpus, meaning gahxpus belongs to pezgpus and wedtpus.",

    "Thus, x is ceslpus, so x belongs to babspus.",
    "Therefore, x is babgpus, babrpus, and babspus.",
    "So, the statement is true.",
    "But let me double-check if there are any missing links or contradictions.",

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

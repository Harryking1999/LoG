So, I'll start by tracing what pitxpus is connected to.\n\nGiven: x is pitxpus.\n\nAlso, pitxpus is wuwcpus. So, x is wuwcpus indirectly.\n\nNow, wuwcpus is pedkpus and qidspus. So, x belongs to pedkpus and qidspus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is connected to babbpus or babcpus. babbpus is mentioned in: seccpus is babbpus and wumjpus. So, babbpus is a subcategory of seccpus.\n\nI need to find a path from x to babbpus or babcpus. babcpus isn't mentioned anywhere in the given information, so it might be unknown, but I need to check if x is babbpus.\n\nSince x is pitxpus, and pitxpus is wuwcpus, and wuwcpus is pedkpus and qidspus, I need to see where pedkpus and qidspus lead.\n\nFrom the given, pedkpus is gipqpus.

So, cinypus is a type of kaqkpus.\n\nkaqkpus is zikcpus. So, kaqkpus is a type of zikcpus.\n\nzikcpus is diwvpus and callpus. So, zikcpus has subcategories diwvpus and callpus.\n\ndiwvpus is niqtpus.

So, tejmpus is a type of seccpus.\n\nAnd seccpus is babbpus and wumjpus. So, finally, seccpus has babbpus as a subcategory.\n\nTherefore, through this long chain, we can see that x is ultimately connected to babbpus.\n\nBut let's confirm the path. We have x is pitxpus, which is wuwcpus, which is pedkpus, and so on. But in the chain above, I started from pedkpus and went through gipqpus, cacypus, jigdpus, damrpus, biqmpus, hinxpus, yivhpus, relcpus, jodtpus, teczpus, yufcpus, yesqpus, kusgpus, hismpus, nizkpus, gagfpus, vixppus, wegrpus, goxnpus, jajzpus, zuxrpus, normpus, hodspus, xapgpus, xirspus, hetjpus, sufcpus, ninvpus, vardpus, gambpus, tuhtpus, hanypus, daclpus, cinypus, kaqkpus, zikcpus, diwvpus, niqtpus, vawdpus, bibwpus, gavwpus, borhpus, tejmpus, seccpus, and then babbpus.\n\nThis seems convoluted, but it should be correct. However, I need to ensure that this path is valid and that there are no contradictions.\n\nAlso, note that x is pitxpus, and pitxpus is wuwcpus, and wuwcpus is pedkpus and qidspus. I used pedkpus in the chain, but I also have qidspus. I don't know what qidspus is, but since I have a path through pedkpus to babbpus, it should be sufficient for x to be babbpus because x is pedkpus through wuwcpus.\n\nBut the question is whether x is babbpus or babcpus. babcpus is not mentioned, so probably not, but since x is babbpus, it should be true that x is babbpus.\n\nI should double-check if there is a shorter path or if I missed something.\n\nFrom the given, we have seccpus is babbpus and wumjpus, and tejmpus is seccpus, and so on.\n\nBut in the chain, I have tejmpus from borhpus, etc.\n\nNow, is there a direct connection? No, but through the hierarchy, x belongs to babbpus eventually.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', so it's a hierarchical relationship. So, if A is B, and B is C, then A is C, meaning A belongs to C.\n\nSo, transitively, x should belong to babbpus.\n\nBut let's see the question: \"is it true or false or unknown: x is babbpus or babcpus?\"\n\nSince babcpus is not mentioned, we don't know about babcpus, but for babbpus, it should be true.\n\nBut I need to make sure that x is indeed babbpus through the chain.\n\nI recall that in the beginning, I have x is pitxpus, and pitxpus is wuwcpus, and wuwcpus is pedkpus, so x is pedkpus.\n\nThen pedkpus is gipqpus, so x is gipqpus.\n\ngipqpus is cacypus and maxcpus, so x is cacypus (since it belongs to gipqpus, which has cacypus as a subcategory, so x is contained in cacypus? No.\n\nThe relationship: if A is B, it means A is a subset of B or A is contained in B. But in terms of instances, if x is A, and A is B, then x is B.\n\nBut when B has multiple parts, like B is C and D, then if A is B, and B is C and D, then A is C and A is D? Not necessarily. Because if B is the category that contains C and D, then A being B means A is contained in B, which contains C and D, so A might not be directly C or D, but since A is in B, and B consists of C and D, then A should be part of C or D or both? This is ambiguous.\n\nI need to clarify the semantics.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, it seems that B is a category, and A is a member or subset of that category.\n\nBut when it says \"B is C and D\", it means that category B consists of subcategories C and D, meaning that anything in B is either in C or in D or both? Or does it mean that B is defined as the union of C and D?\n\nIn logic, if B is C and D, it might mean that B is equivalent to C ∪ D.\n\nBut in this context, since it's about categories, probably \"B is C and D\" means that C and D are subcategories of B, so if A is B, then A is contained in B, which contains C and D, so A might be in C or in D or in both.\n\nBut for the purpose of \"is A in E?\", we need to see if A is contained in E through the hierarchy.\n\nIn this case, for x to be babbpus, we need that babbpus is a category that x belongs to, meaning that through the chain, x is contained in a category that has babbpus as a subcategory, but since babbpus is a subcategory, x might not be directly babbpus unless we trace to the leaf.\n\nBut in the chain, when we have seccpus is babbpus and wumjpus, it means that seccpus consists of babbpus and wumjpus, so if something is seccpus, it is either babbpus or wumjpus.\n\nThen, if x is seccpus, then x is babbpus or wumjpus.\n\nBut in my chain, I have x eventually being seccpus, so if x is seccpus, then since seccpus is babbpus or wumjpus, x could be babbpus or wumjpus, so it might not necessarily be babbpus; it could be wumjpus.\n\nBut the question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus?\", so if x is babbpus, it true, or if x is babcpus, but babcpus is not mentioned, so if x is wumjpus, then it is not babbpus, so it might be false for babbpus, but since it is or babcpus, and babcpus is unknown, we need to see if x is babbpus.\n\nBut from the chain, x is seccpus, so x is either babbpus or wumjpus. So, it is possible that x is babbpus, but it is not guaranteed; it could be wumjpus.\n\nTherefore, we cannot say for sure that x is babbpus; it might be wumjpus.\n\nSo, for the statement \"x is babbpus or babcpus\", since babcpus is not in the hierarchy, and x might not be babbpus, it could be false if x is wumjpus.\n\nBut we need to determine if it is true or false or unknown.\n\nSince x is seccpus, and seccpus has two subcategories, we don't know which one x belongs to, so we cannot say that x is babbpus; it might be wumjpus.\n\nTherefore, it is unknown whether x is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, babcpus is not mentioned, so definitely not babcpus.\n\nSo, the OR statement: if x is babbpus, it true, else if not, but since we don't know if x is babbpus, it is unknown.\n\nBut let's confirm the chain to see if x must be babbpus or not.\n\nFrom the chain, x is pitxpus, pitxpus is wuwcpus, wuwcpus is pedkpus and qidspus. So, x is pedkpus and x is qidspus? Since wuwcpus is pedkpus and qidspus, it means that wuwcpus consists of pedkpus and qidspus, so x, which is pitxpus, which is wuwcpus, so x is contained in wuwcpus, which contains pedkpus and qidspus, so x is either pedkpus or qidspus or both? But since x is an instance, probably x is one of them, but we don't know which.\n\nSimilarly, when we say A is B and C, it means that A is composed of B and C, so for a member x of A, it belongs to B or C.\n\nSo, for x, since it is wuwcpus, and wuwcpus is pedkpus and qidspus, then x is either pedkpus or qidspus.\n\nNow, from pedkpus, we have a path to seccpus, but from qidspus, we don't have any information? What is qidspus? It is not defined anywhere else. So, if x is qidspus, then we don't know what qidspus is, so it might not lead to babbpus.\n\nBut in the chain, I assumed x is pedkpus, but x could be qidspus, which is unknown.\n\nTherefore, even from wuwcpus, x might be pedkpus or qidspus.\n\nIf x is pedkpus, then from pedkpus, we can go to gipqpus, etc., eventually to seccpus, and then to babbpus or wumjpus.\n\nBut since seccpus is babbpus and wumjpus, if x is seccpus, then x is either babbpus or wumjpus.\n\nSo, if x is pedkpus, then x is seccpus, but then x could be babbpus or wumjpus.\n\nIf x is qidspus, then we don't know, so x might not be babbpus.\n\nTherefore, overall, we cannot guarantee that x is babbpus.\n\nHence, for the statement \"x is babbpus\", it is unknown.\n\nAnd for babcpus, it is not in the hierarchy, so false for babcpus.\n\nBut the question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus?\", which is true only if x is babbpus or x is babcpus.\n\nSince x is not babcpus (as it is not mentioned), and we don't know if x is babbpus, the OR statement is unknown.\n\nBut let's see if there is any other path.\n\nPerhaps from other parts, but since x is pitxpus, and pitxpus is wuwcpus, and that's the only definition, we have to go through that.\n\nAnother thing: in the given, there is yesqpus is kusgpus, etc., but that seems part of the chain.\n\nBut in my chain, I went from pedkpus to gipqpus to cacypus to jigdpus to damrpus to biqmpus to hinxpus to yivhpus to relcpus to jodtpus to teczpus to yufcpus to yesqpus to kusgpus to hismpus to nizkpus to gagfpus to vixppus to wegrpus to goxnpus to jajzpus to zuxrpus to normpus to hodspus to xapgpus to xirspus to hetjpus to sufcpus to ninvpus to vardpus to gambpus to tuhtpus to hanypus to daclpus to cinypus to kaqkpus to zikcpus to diwvpus to niqtpus to vawdpus to bibwpus to gavwpus to borhpus to tejmpus to seccpus to babbpus.\n\nThis chain is very long, and at each step, when there are multiple subcategories, we don't know which one x belongs to.\n\nFor example, when we have biqmpus is hinxpus and mockpus and filhpus, then if x is biqmpus, it could be hinxpus or mockpus or filhpus. In my chain, I used hinxpus, but x could be mockpus or filhpus, which might not lead to seccpus? Let's see.\n\nIf x is mockpus or filhpus, what are they? mockpus and filhpus are not defined further, so if x is mockpus, then it might not go to seccpus, so x might not be seccpus.\n\nSimilarly, in other points, there are branches.\n\nSo, actually, from pedkpus, there are multiple paths, and only some paths lead to seccpus.\n\nIn my chain, I followed hinxpus, but if x is mockpus or filhpus, it stops.\n\nSimilarly, at other points.\n\nSo, for x to be seccpus, it must follow the specific path that I took, but since there are branches, it is not certain that x is seccpus; it might be on another branch that doesn't lead to seccpus.\n\nTherefore, it is even more uncertain that x is babbpus.\n\nSo, definitely, we cannot say that x is babbpus.\n\nThus, for the question, \"x is babbpus or babcpus?\" since babcpus is not defined, and x may not be babbpus, it is unknown.\n\nBut let's see if there is any way that x must be babbpus.\n\nPerhaps from the chain, all paths eventually lead to seccpus? But from the given, not all paths do; for example, if x is maxcpus from gipqpus, what is maxcpus? It is not defined, so if x is maxcpus, it stops there.\n\nSimilarly, if x is qidspus from wuwcpus, it stops.\n\nSo, no, x may not be seccpus at all.\n\nTherefore, it is unknown whether x is babbpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be unknown.\n\nBut the question is \"or babcpus\", and since babcpus is not mentioned, it is false that x is babcpus, but for the OR, since one is unknown and one is false, the OR is unknown.\n\nIn logic, if A is unknown and B is false, then A OR B is unknown.\n\nSo, yes.\n\nTherefore, for the statement, it is unknown.\n\nSo, I think the answer is unknown.\n\nBut let's make sure about babcpus. Is babcpus anywhere? No, from the given, only babbpus is mentioned, so babcpus is not a category in the hierarchy, so x cannot be babcpus.\n\nThus, false for babcpus.\n\nBut for babbpus, unknown.\n\nSo, overall unknown.",

Because if B is the category that contains C and D, then A being B means A is contained in B, which contains C and D, so A might not be directly C or D, but since A is in B, and B consists of C and D, then A should be part of C or D or both? This is ambiguous.\n\nI need to clarify the semantics.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, it seems that B is a category, and A is a member or subset of that category.\n\nBut when it says \"B is C and D\", it means that category B consists of subcategories C and D, meaning that anything in B is either in C or in D or both? Or does it mean that B is defined as the union of C and D?\n\nIn logic, if B is C and D, it might mean that B is equivalent to C ∪ D.\n\nBut in this context, since it's about categories, probably \"B is C and D\" means that C and D are subcategories of B, so if A is B, then A is contained in B, which contains C and D, so A might be in C or in D or in both.\n\nBut for the purpose of \"is A in E?\", we need to see if A is contained in E through the hierarchy.\n\nIn this case, for x to be babbpus, we need that babbpus is a category that x belongs to, meaning that through the chain, x is contained in a category that has babbpus as a subcategory, but since babbpus is a subcategory, x might not be directly babbpus unless we trace to the leaf.\n\nBut in the chain, when we have seccpus is babbpus and wumjpus, it means that seccpus consists of babbpus and wumjpus, so if something is seccpus, it is either babbpus or wumjpus.\n\nThen, if x is seccpus, then x is babbpus or wumjpus.\n\nBut in my chain, I have x eventually being seccpus, so if x is seccpus, then since seccpus is babbpus or wumjpus, x could be babbpus or wumjpus, so it might not necessarily be babbpus; it could be wumjpus.\n\nBut the question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus?\", so if x is babbpus, it true, or if x is babcpus, but babcpus is not mentioned, so if x is wumjpus, then it is not babbpus, so it might be false for babbpus, but since it is or babcpus, and babcpus is unknown, we need to see if x is babbpus.\n\nBut from the chain, x is seccpus, so x is either babbpus or wumjpus. So, it is possible that x is babbpus, but it is not guaranteed; it could be wumjpus.\n\nTherefore, we cannot say for sure that x is babbpus; it might be wumjpus.\n\nSo, for the statement \"x is babbpus or babcpus\", since babcpus is not in the hierarchy, and x might not be babbpus, it could be false if x is wumjpus.\n\nBut we need to determine if it is true or false or unknown.\n\nSince x is seccpus, and seccpus has two subcategories, we don't know which one x belongs to, so we cannot say that x is babbpus; it might be wumjpus.\n\nTherefore, it is unknown whether x is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, babcpus is not mentioned, so definitely not babcpus.\n\nSo, the OR statement: if x is babbpus, it true, else if not, but since we don't know if x is babbpus, it is unknown.\n\nBut let's confirm the chain to see if x must be babbpus or not.\n\nFrom the chain, x is pitxpus, pitxpus is wuwcpus, wuwcpus is pedkpus and qidspus. So, x is pedkpus and x is qidspus? Since wuwcpus is pedkpus and qidspus, it means that wuwcpus consists of pedkpus and qidspus, so x, which is pitxpus, which is wuwcpus, so x is contained in wuwcpus, which contains pedkpus and qidspus, so x is either pedkpus or qidspus or both? But since x is an instance, probably x is one of them, but we don't know which.\n\nSimilarly, when we say A is B and C, it means that A is composed of B and C, so for a member x of A, it belongs to B or C.\n\nSo, for x, since it is wuwcpus, and wuwcpus is pedkpus and qidspus, then x is either pedkpus or qidspus.\n\nNow, from pedkpus, we have a path to seccpus, but from qidspus, we don't have any information? What is qidspus? It is not defined anywhere else. So, if x is qidspus, then we don't know what qidspus is, so it might not lead to babbpus.\n\nBut in the chain, I assumed x is pedkpus, but x could be qidspus, which is unknown.\n\nTherefore, even from wuwcpus, x might be pedkpus or qidspus.\n\nIf x is pedkpus, then from pedkpus, we can go to gipqpus, etc., eventually to seccpus, and then to babbpus or wumjpus.\n\nBut since seccpus is babbpus and wumjpus, if x is seccpus, then x is either babbpus or wumjpus.\n\nSo, if x is pedkpus, then x is seccpus, but then x could be babbpus or wumjpus.\n\nIf x is qidspus, then we don't know, so x might not be babbpus.\n\nTherefore, overall, we cannot guarantee that x is babbpus.\n\nHence, for the statement \"x is babbpus\", it is unknown.\n\nAnd for babcpus, it is not in the hierarchy, so false for babcpus.\n\nBut the question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus?\", which is true only if x is babbpus or x is babcpus.\n\nSince x is not babcpus (as it is not mentioned), and we don't know if x is babbpus, the OR statement is unknown.\n\nBut let's see if there is any other path.\n\nPerhaps from other parts, but since x is pitxpus, and pitxpus is wuwcpus, and that's the only definition, we have to go through that.\n\nAnother thing: in the given, there is yesqpus is kusgpus, etc., but that seems part of the chain.\n\nBut in my chain, I went from pedkpus to gipqpus to cacypus to jigdpus to damrpus to biqmpus to hinxpus to yivhpus to relcpus to jodtpus to teczpus to yufcpus to yesqpus to kusgpus to hismpus to nizkpus to gagfpus to vixppus to wegrpus to goxnpus to jajzpus to zuxrpus to normpus to hodspus to xapgpus to xirspus to hetjpus to sufcpus to ninvpus to vardpus to gambpus to tuhtpus to hanypus to daclpus to cinypus to kaqkpus to zikcpus to diwvpus to niqtpus to vawdpus to bibwpus to gavwpus to borhpus to tejmpus to seccpus to babbpus.\n\nThis chain is very long, and at each step, when there are multiple subcategories, we don't know which one x belongs to.\n\nFor example, when we have biqmpus is hinxpus and mockpus and filhpus, then if x is biqmpus, it could be hinxpus or mockpus or filhpus. In my chain, I used hinxpus, but x could be mockpus or filhpus, which might not lead to seccpus? Let's see.\n\nIf x is mockpus or filhpus, what are they? mockpus and filhpus are not defined further, so if x is mockpus, then it might not go to seccpus, so x might not be seccpus.\n\nSimilarly, in other points, there are branches.\n\nSo, actually, from pedkpus, there are multiple paths, and only some paths lead to seccpus.\n\nIn my chain, I followed hinxpus, but if x is mockpus or filhpus, it stops.\n\nSimilarly, at other points.\n\nSo, for x to be seccpus, it must follow the specific path that I took, but since there are branches, it is not certain that x is seccpus; it might be on another branch that doesn't lead to seccpus.\n\nTherefore, it is even more uncertain that x is babbpus.\n\nSo, definitely, we cannot say that x is babbpus.\n\nThus, for the question, \"x is babbpus or babcpus?\" since babcpus is not defined, and x may not be babbpus, it is unknown.\n\nBut let's see if there is any way that x must be babbpus.\n\nPerhaps from the chain, all paths eventually lead to seccpus? But from the given, not all paths do; for example, if x is maxcpus from gipqpus, what is maxcpus? It is not defined, so if x is maxcpus, it stops there.\n\nSimilarly, if x is qidspus from wuwcpus, it stops.\n\nSo, no, x may not be seccpus at all.\n\nTherefore, it is unknown whether x is babbpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be unknown.\n\nBut the question is \"or babcpus\", and since babcpus is not mentioned, it is false that x is babcpus, but for the OR, since one is unknown and one is false, the OR is unknown.\n\nIn logic, if A is unknown and B is false, then A OR B is unknown.\n\nSo, yes.\n\nTherefore, for the statement, it is unknown.\n\nSo, I think the answer is unknown.\n\nBut let's make sure about babcpus. Is babcpus anywhere? No, from the given, only babbpus is mentioned, so babcpus is not a category in the hierarchy, so x cannot be babcpus.\n\nThus, false for babcpus.\n\nBut for babbpus, unknown.\n\nSo, overall unknown.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, overall unknown.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

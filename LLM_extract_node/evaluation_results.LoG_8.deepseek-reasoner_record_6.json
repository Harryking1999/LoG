So x belongs to jewdpus and wokrpus.\n\njewdpus is xapmpus, so x belongs to xapmpus through jewdpus.\n\nxapmpus is vorppus and tihppus, so x belongs to vorppus and tihppus.\n\nvorppus is vodkpus, so x belongs to vodkpus.\n\nvodkpus is hilxpus, so x belongs to hilxpus.\n\nhilxpus is voympus, so x belongs to voympus.\n\nvoympus is tuqhpus and kahxpus and pottpus, so x belongs to tuqhpus, etc.\n\ntuqhpus is fukdpus and turppus, so x belongs to fukdpus.\n\nfukdpus is cisxpus and tamgpus, so x belongs to cisxpus.\n\ncisxpus is jelbpus, so x belongs to jelbpus.\n\njelbpus is bozxpus and jarfpus, so x belongs to bozxpus.\n\nbozxpus is guqrpus and ginkpus, so x belongs to guqrpus.\n\nguqrpus is huszpus, so x belongs to huszpus.\n\nhuszpus is faxwpus and fulzpus and yucwpus and dajdpus, so x belongs to faxwpus.\n\nfaxwpus is nufspus, so x belongs to nufspus.\n\nnufspus is sallpus and tuzcpus, so x belongs to sallpus.\n\nsallpus is pomdpus, so x belongs to pomdpus.\n\npomdpus is fejtpus and dotgpus and hehgpus, so x belongs to fejtpus.\n\nfejtpus is vuflpus, so x belongs to vuflpus.

From the statements, qotppus is jewdpus and wokrpus, but I don't have any definition for wokrpus. So wokrpus might not be defined, so I can't use that path.\n\nSimilarly, from jewdpus, I went to xapmpus, etc.\n\nBut in the chain, I have voympus which has tuqhpus, and tuqhpus is fukdpus, which I used, but fukdpus is cisxpus, which leads to jelbpus, etc., but that doesn't lead to kufhpus.\n\nIs there a connection from jelbpus to kufhpus?

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

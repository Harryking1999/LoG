  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is both babbpus and babmpus. From the given information, x is bikzpus. So, I have to trace what bikzpus is and see if it leads to babbpus and babmpus.\n\nLet me list out the relevant statements:\n\n- x is bikzpus. (given)\n\n- mifkpus is babbpus. (given)\n\n- buldpus is babmpus. (given)\n\nI need to see if bikzpus is connected to babbpus and babmpus.\n\nAlso, from the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so it might be transitive or hierarchical. I need to follow the chains.\n\nLet me start with babbpus. We have mifkpus is babbpus. But I need to see if bikzpus is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly for babmpus, buldpus is babmpus, but I need bikzpus to be babmpus.\n\nNow, I should look for connections between bikzpus and these categories.\n\nFrom the given:\n\n- fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus. (but fotbpus is part of bikzpus? Let's see)\n\n- bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus. (so bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus)\n\nBut I need to know what fotbpus is, and so on.\n\nI also have femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus. And since mifkpus is babbpus, if femfpus is mifkpus, then femfpus is also babbpus? But according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if femfpus is mifkpus, and mifkpus is babbpus, then femfpus should be babbpus as well? But let's see the meaning.\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\", not that A equals B. So, it seems that if A is B, and B is C, then A is C? I think we can assume transitivity here because if A belongs to B and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C.\n\nSimilarly, if A is contained in B and B is contained in C, then A is contained in C.\n\nSo, I think we can use transitivity for \"is\" in this context.\n\nTherefore, if I can find that bikzpus is connected to mifkpus or directly to babbpus, then it might be true.\n\nSimilarly for babmpus.\n\nNow, let's list all statements that might be relevant.\n\nFirst, find what bikzpus is: bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus.\n\nNow, what is fotbpus? fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus.\n\nWhat is sucbpus? sucbpus is wefwpus.\n\nWhat is wefwpus? wefwpus is disjpus and bubjpus.\n\nWhat is disjpus? disjpus is posjpus. Also, disjpus is fewfpus. But from above, disjpus is posjpus, and disjpus is fewfpus? That might mean disjpus belongs to both, but we need to see.\n\nActually, from the statements: disjpus is posjpus. and disjpus is fewfpus. So disjpus is contained in posjpus and also in fewfpus? But that might not be consistent if posjpus and fewfpus are different categories. But since it's containment, it could be that disjpus is in multiple categories.\n\nBut for transitivity, we need to see the chains.\n\nAlso, from wefwpus is disjpus and bubjpus, so wefwpus contains disjpus.\n\nBut wefwpus is sucbpus, so sucbpus contains wefwpus, which contains disjpus.\n\nNow, fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus, so fotbpus contains sucbpus, which contains wefwpus, which contains disjpus.\n\nBut I need to connect to babbpus.\n\nI have femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus, and mifkpus is babbpus, so femfpus is babbpus.\n\nNow, is there a connection between bikzpus and femfpus?\n\nbikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus.\n\nfotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus.\n\nsucbpus is wefwpus.\n\nwefwpus is disjpus and bubjpus.\n\ndisjpus is fewfpus? disjpus is posjpus and also disjpus is fewfpus? Let's see the statements.\n\nFrom given: disjpus is posjpus. and disjpus is fewfpus. So disjpus is contained in fewfpus.\n\nAlso, fewfpus is qiwrpus and zonqpus.\n\nAnd qiwrpus is hezqpus.\n\nhezqpus is pofhpus.\n\npofhpus is bokhpus and leghpus.\n\nbokhpus is gozppus.\n\ngozppus is kimcpus and nipdpus.\n\nkimcpus is jadypus.\n\njadypus is hankpus and kaqgpus and qacvpus.\n\nhankpus is sadhpus. and hankpus is cedspus and sucxpus.\n\nsadhpus is japvpus.\n\njapvpus is tagkpus and bepnpus and beyzpus.\n\ntagkpus is coxvpus and camppus.\n\ncoxvpus is yuzgpus.\n\nyuzgpus is kewqpus and qivppus.\n\nkewqpus is dubwpus.\n\ndubwpus is zeffpus.\n\nzeffpus is fiqrpus.\n\nfiqrpus is maxhpus and qifbpus.\n\nmaxhpus is rufppus and webgpus.\n\nrufppus is katkpus.\n\nkatkpus is dusgpus.\n\ndusgpus is qonlpus and misppus.\n\nqonlpus is xadrpus.\n\nxadrpus is jifspus.\n\nThis seems messy, and I don't see a connection to femfpus yet.\n\nI also have jebypus is femfpus.\n\nAnd fozjpus is jebypus.\n\nAnd miwjpus is fozjpus and ficppus.\n\nAnd yilzpus is miwjpus and hukgpus.\n\nAnd jaczpus is yilzpus.\n\nAnd sanfpus is jaczpus and gesqpus and dimmpus.\n\nAnd jipwpus is sanfpus.\n\nAnd maxhpus is jipwpus? maxhpus is rufppus and webgpus, but also from fiqrpus is maxhpus and qifbpus, and maxhpus is jipwpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom given: maxhpus is jipwpus. Yes, it says \"maxhpus is jipwpus\" but also \"maxhpus is rufppus and webgpus\" – so maxhpus contains rufppus and webgpus, and also is jipwpus? That might mean maxhpus belongs to jipwpus? But from the statement, \"maxhpus is jipwpus\" means maxhpus belongs to jipwpus category.\n\nSimilarly, \"maxhpus is rufppus and webgpus\" means maxhpus contains rufppus and webgpus? No, let's read the note: \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B. So when we say \"A is B\", it could mean A is a subset of B or A is an element of B? The note says \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\", which is ambiguous.\n\nLet's read the note carefully: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\"\n\nSo, \"A is B\" can mean either that A is a member of category B, or that A is a subset of category B. But in set theory, if A is contained in B, it means A is a subset of B, but if A belongs to B, it means A is an element of B.\n\nThis is confusing because in the statements, we have both types.\n\nFor example, \"mifkpus is babbpus\" likely means mifkpus is a type of babbpus, so mifkpus belongs to babbpus category.\n\nBut \"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" likely means bikzpus consists of fotbpus and jutypus, so bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus, meaning fotbpus and jutypus are parts of bikzpus.\n\nSo, the direction matters.\n\nIn the note, it says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B. So for example, if A is B and it means A belongs to B, then B is a category, and A is an instance. If A is B and it means A is contained in B, then A is a subset of B.\n\nBut in the statements, we need to interpret each \"is\" based on context.\n\nLook at the statements: \"mifkpus is babbpus\" – here, mifkpus is likely an instance, so it belongs to babbpus.\n\n\"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" – here, bikzpus is composed of fotbpus and jutypus, so bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus, so for this, \"is\" means \"contains\" or \"is made of\", so A is B means A has parts B, so A is contained in B? No, if A contains B, then B is contained in A, so \"A is B\" would mean A contains B, which is the opposite of belonging.\n\nI think there is inconsistency in the interpretation.\n\nLet's read the note again: \"A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'\"\n\nSo, if A belongs to B, then A is an element of B.\n\nIf A is contained in B, then A is a subset of B.\n\nBut in the statement \"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\", if we interpret \"is\" as \"contains\", then it would be that bikzpus contains fotbpus, so fotbpus is contained in bikzpus, so for A is B, if B is fotbpus, then A is B means A contains B, so A is the container, so B is contained in A, so \"A is B\" means that B is contained in A? That doesn't match the note.\n\nPerhaps for this statement, \"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" means that bikzpus is composed of fotbpus and jutypus, so fotbpus and jutypus are parts of bikzpus, so bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus, so from the perspective of categories, bikzpus is a category that includes fotbpus and jutypus, so fotbpus belongs to bikzpus? But the statement says \"bikzpus is fotbpus\" which would mean bikzpus belongs to fotbpus, which is not right.\n\nI think there is a problem with the notation.\n\nLet's look at other statements: \"sucbpus is wefwpus\" – likely means sucbpus contains wefwpus or something.\n\nFrom \"fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus\" and \"sucbpus is wefwpus\", so if fotbpus contains sucbpus, and sucbpus contains wefwpus, then fotbpus contains wefwpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"wefwpus is disjpus and bubjpus\" so wefwpus contains disjpus and bubjpus.\n\nSo, in general, when \"A is B\" appears with multiple things, it seems that A is composed of B, so A contains B.\n\nBut when \"A is B\" appears with a single thing, it might mean A belongs to B.\n\nFor example, \"x is bikzpus\" – x is a single entity, so x belongs to bikzpus category.\n\n\"mifkpus is babbpus\" – mifkpus belongs to babbpus category.\n\n\"buldpus is babmpus\" – buldpus belongs to babmpus category.\n\n\"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" – here, bikzpus is composed of fotbpus and jutypus, so fotbpus and jutypus are parts of bikzpus, so fotbpus belongs to bikzpus category? But the statement says \"bikzpus is fotbpus\" which would imply bikzpus belongs to fotbpus, but that doesn't make sense. So perhaps for this case, \"is\" means \"consists of\" or \"includes\", so it's that bikzpus contains fotbpus.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I need to interpret each statement based on the context.\n\nLet's list the statements where \"A is B\" with multiple Bs, it likely means A contains B or A is made up of B.\n\nWhere \"A is B\" with a single B, it likely means A belongs to B.\n\nBut in the note, it says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B, so for A belongs to B, B is the category, for A contained in B, A is the category and B is the item? No.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of sets.\n\nSuppose each pus is a set or an element.\n\nWhen we say \"A is B\", it means that A is a subset of B or A is an element of B.\n\nBut from the statements, when we have \"A is B and C\", it means that A = B ∪ C or something.\n\nLet's look at the statement: \"japvpus is tagkpus and bepnpus and beyzpus\" – this likely means that japvpus consists of tagkpus, bepnpus, and beyzpus, so tagkpus, bepnpus, and beyzpus are subsets of japvpus or elements? Probably, japvpus is a category that contains tagkpus, bepnpus, and beyzpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"sanjpus is jaczpus and gesqpus and dimmpus\" so sanjpus contains jaczpus, gesqpus, and dimmpus.\n\nSo, in general, if \"A is B and C\" then A contains B and C, so B and C are contained in A.\n\nTherefore, for \"A is B\", if B is a single item, it means A belongs to B, so B contains A.\n\nIf \"A is B and C\" then A contains B and C, so B and C belong to A.\n\nThis seems consistent with the note: \"A is B\" means A belongs to B (so B contains A) or A is contained in B (so A contains B)? The note says \"A is contained in B\" which means A is a subset of B, so B contains A.\n\nBut in the case where \"A is B and C\", it means A contains B and C, so B is contained in A, so for A is B, if B is multiple, it means B is contained in A, which is the opposite of A is contained in B.\n\nSo to clarify, let's define:\n\nWhen we say \"A is B\", it can mean:\n\n- A belongs to B, so A is an element of B, or\n\n- A is contained in B, so A is a subset of B.\n\nBut in the statements, when B is a list, it means that A contains those things, so A is a set that contains B, so for each B_i, B_i is contained in A, so A is the container.\n\nSo for \"A is B and C\", it means that B is contained in A and C is contained in A, so A contains B and C.\n\nFor \"A is B\" where B is single, it usually means A belongs to B, so B contains A.\n\nSo in summary, for a statement \"A is B\":\n\n- If B is a single entity, then A belongs to B, so B contains A.\n\n- If B is multiple entities connected with \"and\", then A contains B, so A contains each of those entities.\n\nThis seems to be the pattern in the given information.\n\nFor example, \"x is bikzpus\" - B is single, so x belongs to bikzpus, so bikzpus contains x.\n\n\"mifkpus is babbpus\" - B is single, so mifkpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus contains mifkpus.\n\n\"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" - B is multiple, so bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus.\n\n\"fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus\" - fotbpus contains sucbpus and xetvpus.\n\n\"sucbpus is wefwpus\" - here, wefwpus is single, so sucbpus belongs to wefwpus? But from earlier, fotbpus contains sucbpus, and if sucbpus belongs to wefwpus, then wefwpus contains sucbpus, but then fotbpus contains sucbpus, which is contained in wefwpus, so fotbpus contains wefwpus? Let's see the statement: \"sucbpus is wefwpus\" - since wefwpus is single, this should mean that sucbpus belongs to wefwpus, so wefwpus contains sucbpus.\n\nBut from \"fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus\", so fotbpus contains sucbpus, so sucbpus is contained in fotbpus and also sucbpus belongs to wefwpus, so wefwpus contains sucbpus. So sucbpus is in both fotbpus and wefwpus, which is possible if fotbpus and wefwpus have overlap.\n\nBut then \"wefwpus is disjpus and bubjpus\" - so wefwpus contains disjpus and bubjpus.\n\nSo for \"sucbpus is wefwpus\", it means sucbpus is an element of wefwpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"disjpus is posjpus\" - disjpus belongs to posjpus.\n\n\"disjpus is fewfpus\" - disjpus belongs to fewfpus.\n\nSo let's adopt this interpretation.\n\nFor any statement \"A is B\":\n\n- If B is a single word, then A belongs to B, so B contains A.\n\n- If B is multiple words with \"and\", then A contains B, so A contains each of the B items.\n\nNow, back to the question: Is x is babbpus and babmpus?\n\nx is bikzpus, so x belongs to bikzpus.\n\nWe need to know if bikzpus is contained in babbpus and babmpus? Or since x belongs to bikzpus, if bikzpus is a subset of babbpus, then x belongs to babbpus.\n\nSimilarly for babmpus.\n\nSo, we need to find if bikzpus is a subset of babbpus and bikzpus is a subset of babmpus.\n\nSince bikzpus is a category, we need to see if all elements of bikzpus are in babbpus and in babmpus.\n\nBut from the statements, we might find that bikzpus is related to other categories that are related to babbpus.\n\nAlternatively, we might find that some element of bikzpus is in babbpus, but that doesn't mean all elements are.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus and babmpus\" which means x belongs to babbpus and x belongs to babmpus.\n\nSince x belongs to bikzpus, if we can show that bikzpus is a subset of babbpus, then x is in babbpus. Similarly for babmpus.\n\nBut if bikzpus is not a subset, but x might be in babbpus through other means, but since we don't know what x is specifically, only that it is in bikzpus, we need to know if all of bikzpus is in babbpus, or if there is a chain that puts x in babbpus.\n\nFrom the statements, we have relationships between categories.\n\nLet's list all statements that might help.\n\nFirst, babbpus: we have mifkpus is babbpus, so mifkpus belongs to babbpus.\n\nAlso, femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus, so femfpus contains mifkpus and vixypus, so since mifkpus belongs to babbpus, and femfpus contains mifkpus, but femfpus itself may not belong to babbpus unless stated.\n\nBut from \"jebypus is femfpus\" - jebypus belongs to femfpus? Or since femfpus is a container, jebypus is an element of femfpus?\n\nLet's see: \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" so femfpus contains mifkpus and vixypus, so mifkpus is in femfpus, and vixypus is in femfpus.\n\nThen \"jebypus is femfpus\" - here femfpus is single, so jebypus belongs to femfpus, so femfpus contains jebypus? But already femfpus contains mifkpus and vixypus, so now femfpus also contains jebypus? But from the statement \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\", it means that femfpus consists of mifkpus and vixypus, so perhaps femfpus has only these two elements, but then \"jebypus is femfpus\" would mean jebypus is femfpus, which contradicts because femfpus is a set with elements, so jebypus cannot be the set itself.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps when we say \"A is B\" with multiple B, it means that A is exactly the set of B, so A = {B1, B2, ...}.\n\nThen when we say \"C is A\" with single A, it means C is an element of A.\n\nSo for \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\", it means femfpus = {mifkpus, vixypus}.\n\nThen \"jebypus is femfpus\" means jebypus is an element of femfpus, so jebypus is either mifkpus or vixypus, but from other statements, jebypus is likely different, so this might be inconsistency.\n\nLet's look at another statement: \"hankpus is sadhpus\" and \"hankpus is cedspus and sucxpus\" – so if \"hankpus is cedspus and sucxpus\" means hankpus = {cedspus, sucxpus}, then \"hankpus is sadhpus\" means hankpus is an element of sadhpus, so sadhpus contains hankpus, but hankpus is a set, so it's possible.\n\nBut then \"sadhpus is japvpus\" so sadhpus belongs to japvpus? Or sadhpus contains japvpus? From \"sadhpus is japvpus\" since japvpus is single, sadhpus belongs to japvpus, so japvpus contains sadhpus.\n\nBut from \"hankpus is sadhpus\" so sadhpus contains hankpus, so japvpus contains sadhpus contains hankpus.\n\nAlso from \"hankpus is cedspus and sucxpus\" so hankpus contains cedspus and sucxpus.\n\nSo for \"A is B\" with single B, A belongs to B.\n\nWith multiple B, A contains B.\n\nSo for the statement \"jebypus is femfpus\", since femfpus is single, jebypus belongs to femfpus, so femfpus contains jebypus.\n\nBut from \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\", femfpus contains mifkpus and vixypus, so femfpus has at least mifkpus, vixypus, and jebypus? But the statement \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" might mean that femfpus consists of only mifkpus and vixypus, so if jebypus is added, it contradicts.\n\nPerhaps the statement \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" means that mifkpus and vixypus are the components of femfpus, but femfpus may have other elements, but typically in such puzzles, \"A is B and C\" means that A is composed of B and C, so A contains B and C, and possibly other things, but from the way it's written, it might be that A is exactly the set {B,C} or the collection.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's assume that when \"A is B and C\" it means that A contains B and C, so B and C are subsets of A or elements of A, but since B and C are individuals, they are elements of A.\n\nSo for \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\", it means that mifkpus and vixypus are elements of femfpus.\n\nThen \"jebypus is femfpus\" means that jebypus is an element of femfpus, so femfpus has elements mifkpus, vixypus, and jebypus.\n\nSimilarly, \" fozyus is jebypus\" means fozyus belongs to jebypus? But let's see: \"fozjpus is jebypus\" so since jebypus is single, fozjpus belongs to jebypus, so jebypus contains fozjpus.\n\nBut from above, jebypus is an element of femfpus, so jebypus is a set that contains fozjpus.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but for the purpose of this problem, we might only need to find connections between categories.\n\nFor the question, we need to see if x is in babbpus and in babmpus.\n\nx is in bikzpus.\n\nSo let's find what bikzpus is related to.\n\nFrom \"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" so bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus. So fotbpus is an element of bikzpus, and jutypus is an element of bikzpus.\n\nNow, fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus, so fotbpus contains sucbpus and xetvpus.\n\nsucbpus is wefwpus, so sucbpus belongs to wefwpus, so wefwpus contains sucbpus.\n\nwefwpus is disjpus and bubjpus, so wefwpus contains disjpus and bubjpus.\n\ndisjpus is posjpus, so disjpus belongs to posjpus, so posjpus contains disjpus.\n\ndisjpus is fewfpus, so disjpus belongs to fewfpus, so fewfpus contains disjpus.\n\nfewfpus is qiwrpus and zonqpus, so fewfpus contains qiwrpus and zonqpus.\n\nqiwrpus is hezqpus, so qiwrpus belongs to hezqpus, so hezqpus contains qiwrpus.\n\nhezqpus is pofhpus, so hezqpus belongs to pofhpus, so pofhpus contains hezqpus.\n\npofhpus is bokhpus and leghpus, so pofhpus contains bokhpus and leghpus.\n\nbokhpus is gozppus, so bokhpus belongs to gozppus, so gozppus contains bokhpus.\n\ngozppus is kimcpus and nipdpus, so gozppus contains kimcpus and nipdpus.\n\nkimcpus is jadypus, so kimcpus belongs to jadypus, so jadypus contains kimcpus.\n\njadypus is hankpus and kaqgpus and qacvpus, so jadypus contains hankpus, kaqgpus, and qacvpus.\n\nhankpus is sadhpus, so hankpus belongs to sadhpus, so sadhpus contains hankpus.\n\nhankpus is cedspus and sucxpus, so hankpus contains cedspus and sucxpus.\n\nsadhpus is japvpus, so sadhpus belongs to japvpus, so japvpus contains sadhpus.\n\njapvpus is tagkpus and bepnpus and beyzpus, so japvpus contains tagkpus, bepnpus, and beyzpus.\n\ntagkpus is coxvpus and camppus, so tagkpus contains coxvpus and camppus.\n\ncoxvpus is yuzgpus, so coxvpus belongs to yuzgpus, so yuzgpus contains coxvpus.\n\nyuzgpus is kewqpus and qivppus, so yuzgpus contains kewqpus and qivppus.\n\nkewqpus is dubwpus, so kewqpus belongs to dubwpus, so dubwpus contains kewqpus.\n\ndubwpus is zeffpus, so dubwpus belongs to zeffpus, so zeffpus contains dubwpus.\n\nzeffpus is fiqrpus, so zeffpus belongs to fiqrpus, so fiqrpus contains zeffpus.\n\nfiqrpus is maxhpus and qifbpus, so fiqrpus contains maxhpus and qifbpus.\n\nmaxhpus is rufppus and webgpus, so maxhpus contains rufppus and webgpus.\n\nmaxhpus is jipwpus, so maxhpus

so xadrpus belongs to jifspus, so jifspus contains xadrpus.\n\nThis is a long chain, and it doesn't seem to connect to babbpus.\n\nNow, we also have other statements.\n\nFrom above, we have femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus, so femfpus contains mifkpus and vixypus.\n\nmifkpus is babbpus, so mifkpus belongs to babbpus.\n\nSo since mifkpus is in femfpus, and mifkpus is in babbpus, but that doesn't mean femfpus is in babbpus.\n\nAlso, jebypus is femfpus, so jebypus belongs to femfpus.\n\nfozjpus is jebypus, so fozjpus belongs to jebypus.\n\nmiwjpus is fozjpus and ficppus, so miwjpus contains fozjpus and ficppus.\n\nyilzpus is miwjpus and hukgpus, so yilzpus contains miwjpus and hukgpus.\n\njaczpus is yilzpus, so jaczpus belongs to yilzpus, so yilzpus contains jaczpus.\n\njaczpus is wefjpus and

xadrpus.\n\nThis doesn't connect to yivtpus.\n\nFrom other side, we have yivtpus is in vatlpus, and vatlpus is in hudzpus, and hudzpus is in wefjpus, and wefjpus is in jaczpus, and jaczpus is in yilzpus, and yilzpus is in miwjpus, and miwjpus is in fozjpus, and fozjpus is in jebypus, and jebypus is in femfpus, and femfpus is in mifkpus? No, femfpus contains mifkpus, so mifkpus is in femfpus.\n\nBut we need to connect to bikzpus.\n\nbikzpus contains fotbpus, which contains sucbpus, etc., but no connection to femfpus or jebypus.\n\nPerhaps from jutypus? But we have no information about jutypus.\n\nFrom the statements, we have \"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" so we have fotbpus and jutypus, but no other mentions of jutypus, so we don't know what jutypus is.\n\nSimilarly, for fotbpus, we have its components, but they don't seem to connect to babbpus or babmpus.\n\nNow, for babbpus, we have mifkpus is babbpus, so anything in mifkpus might be in babbpus, but mifkpus is contained in femfpus, so femfpus contains mifkpus, but femfpus may not be in babbpus.\n\nFrom \" femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" so femfpus has mifkpus, which is in babbpus, but femfpus itself is not necessarily in babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, for x, since x is in bikzpus, and bikzpus doesn't seem related to mifkpus, so x is not in babbpus.\n\nBut let's see if there is any indirect connection.\n\nFrom \" femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" and \"jebypus is femfpus\" so jebypus is in femfpus.\n\n\" fozjpus is jebypus\" so fozjpus is in jebypus.\n\n\" miwjpus is fozjpus and ficppus\" so miwjpus has fozjpus.\n\n\" yilzpus is miwjpus and hukgpus\" so yilzpus has miwjpus.\n\n\" jaczpus is yilzpus\" so jaczpus is in yilzpus.\n\n\" jaczpus is wefjpus and hisnpus\" so jaczpus has wefjpus and hisnpus.\n\n\" wefjpus is hudzpus\" so wefjpus is in hudzpus.\n\n\" hudzpus is vatlpus\" so hudzpus is in vatlpus.\n\n\" vatlpus is yivtpus and vugfpus\" so vatlpus has yivtpus and vugfpus.\n\n\" yivtpus is buldpus\" so yivtpus is in buldpus.\n\n\" buldpus is babmpus\" so buldpus is in babmpus.\n\nSo from this, we have a chain from femfpus to babmpus: femfpus contains jebypus, which contains fozjpus, which is in miwjpus, which is in yilzpus, which contains jaczpus, which contains wefjpus, which is in hudzpus, which is in vatlpus, which contains yivtpus, which is in buldpus, which is in babmpus.\n\nSo anything in femfpus is eventually in babmpus? Not necessarily, because the chain is about containment, but for example, jebypus is in femfpus, so jebypus is in babmpus through the chain? Let's see.\n\njebypus is in femfpus, and from the chain, since jebypus is in femfpus, and then fozjpus is in jebypus, so fozjpus is in jebypus which is in femfpus, but for jebypus itself, is it in babmpus? From the chain, we have that yivtpus is in babmpus, but jebypus is not directly related to yivtpus.\n\nFrom the chain, we have vatlpus contains yivtpus, and vatlpus contains hudzpus, which contains wefjpus, which is in jaczpus, which is in yilzpus, which contains miwjpus, which contains fozjpus, which is in jebypus, so indeed, jebypus is contained in this chain, so since jebypus is in femfpus, and from the chain, jebypus is contained in systems that lead to babmpus, but does that mean that jebypus is in babmpus?\n\nLet's think about sets.\n\nIf A is in B, and B is in C, then A is in C only if the containment is transitive for elements. But here, when we say \"A is in B\" it means A belongs to B, so B is a set containing A.\n\nThen if B is in C, it means B belongs to C, so C is a set containing B, so since A is in B and B is in C, then A is in C only if C contains all elements of B, which it does because B is an element of C, but C may not contain elements of B unless B is a subset of C, but since B is an element of C, C contains B as an element, not necessarily as a subset, so A may not be in C.\n\nFor example, if B = {A}, and C = {B}, then C contains B, but A is not in C because C has only B, not A.\n\nSo in set terms, if A ∈ B and B ∈ C, then A may not be in C.\n\nSo in this case, for jebypus to be in babmpus, we need that babmpus contains jebypus, but from the chain, we have that buldpus contains yivtpus, and buldpus is in babmpus, so babmpus contains buldpus, but buldpus contains yivtpus, so yivtpus is in buldpus, and since buldpus is in babmpus, yivtpus is in babmpus? Similarly, if buldpus contains yivtpus, and babmpus contains buldpus, then since buldpus is a set, and babmpus contains buldpus as an element, then yivtpus is an element of buldpus, but not necessarily an element of babmpus unless babmpus also contains all elements of buldpus, which is not stated.\n\nSo for example, if babmpus = { buldpus }, then buldpus = { yivtpus }, so yivtpus is in buldpus but not in babmpus.\n\nSo to have yivtpus in babmpus, we need that babmpus contains yivtpus, which requires that buldpus is a subset of babmpus or that babmpus contains yivtpus directly.\n\nBut from \"buldpus is babmpus\", it means buldpus belongs to babmpus, so babmpus contains buldpus, but不一定包含 buldpus的元素.\n\nSo in this context, since \" buldpus is babmpus\" means buldpus is an instance of babmpus, so babmpus is a category that includes buldpus, but may not include elements of buldpus.\n\nTherefore, for x to be in babmpus, x must be an instance of babmpus, so x must be buldpus or another instance, but from the information, we have only buldpus as babmpus, so unless x is buldpus, x may not be in babmpus.\n\nSimilarly for babbpus, only mifkpus is babbpus, so unless x is mifkpus, x may not be in babbpus.\n\nNow, x is bikzpus, and from the chains, bikzpus doesn't appear to be mifkpus or buldpus.\n\nSo likely, x is not babbpus and not babmpus.\n\nBut let's see if there is any statement that directly says bikzpus is related to mifkpus or buldpus.\n\nFrom the given, we have \" femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" so mifkpus is in femfpus.\n\nAnd \" jebypus is femfpus\" so jebypus is in femfpus.\n\nAnd \" fozjpus is jebypus\" so fozjpus is in jebypus.\n\nAnd \" miwjpus is fozjpus and ficppus\" so fozjpus is in miwjpus.\n\nAnd \" yilzpus is miwjpus and hukgpus\" so miwjpus is in yilzpus.\n\nAnd \" jaczpus is yilzpus\" so jaczpus is in yilzpus.\n\nAnd \" wefjpus is jaczpus\" from \" jaczpus is wefjpus and hisnpus\" so jaczpus contains wefjpus, so wefjpus is in jaczpus.\n\nAnd \" wefjpus is hudzpus\" so wefjpus is in hudzpus.\n\nAnd \" hudzpus is vatlpus\" so hudzpus is in vatlpus.\n\nAnd \" vatlpus is yivtpus and vugfpus\" so yivtpus is in vatlpus.\n\nAnd \" yivtpus is buldpus\" so yivtpus is in buldpus.\n\nBut from this, we have that fozjpus is in miwjpus, etc., but no connection to bikzpus.\n\nbikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus, and fotbpus contains sucbpus, etc., but no mention of femfpus or jebypus in that chain.\n\nSo bikzpus is not connected to mifkpus or buldpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is in bikzpus, and bikzpus is not in babbpus or babmpus, x is not in babbpus and not in babmpus.\n\nSo the statement \"x is babbpus and babmpus\" is false.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any other statement.\n\nWe have \"x is bikzpus\" and that's all.\n\nAlso, from \"yivtpus is buldpus\" and \"buldpus is babmpus\", but yivtpus is not x.\n\nSimilarly, \"mifkpus is babbpus\" but mifkpus is not x.\n\nSo indeed, x is not babbpus and not babmpus.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be false.\n\nSo for the question: Is it true or false or unknown: x is babbpus and babmpus?\n\nIt is false.",
  "thinking_text": "First, I need to determine if x is both babbpus and babmpus. From the given information, x is bikzpus. So, I have to trace what bikzpus is and see if it leads to babbpus and babmpus.\n\nLet me list out the relevant statements:\n\n- x is bikzpus. (given)\n\n- mifkpus is babbpus. (given)\n\n- buldpus is babmpus. (given)\n\nI need to see if bikzpus is connected to babbpus and babmpus.\n\nAlso, from the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so it might be transitive or hierarchical. I need to follow the chains.\n\nLet me start with babbpus. We have mifkpus is babbpus. But I need to see if bikzpus is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly for babmpus, buldpus is babmpus, but I need bikzpus to be babmpus.\n\nNow, I should look for connections between bikzpus and these categories.\n\nFrom the given:\n\n- fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus. (but fotbpus is part of bikzpus? Let's see)\n\n- bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus. (so bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus)\n\nBut I need to know what fotbpus is, and so on.\n\nI also have femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus. And since mifkpus is babbpus, if femfpus is mifkpus, then femfpus is also babbpus? But according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if femfpus is mifkpus, and mifkpus is babbpus, then femfpus should be babbpus as well? But let's see the meaning.\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\", not that A equals B. So, it seems that if A is B, and B is C, then A is C? I think we can assume transitivity here because if A belongs to B and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C.\n\nSimilarly, if A is contained in B and B is contained in C, then A is contained in C.\n\nSo, I think we can use transitivity for \"is\" in this context.\n\nTherefore, if I can find that bikzpus is connected to mifkpus or directly to babbpus, then it might be true.\n\nSimilarly for babmpus.\n\nNow, let's list all statements that might be relevant.\n\nFirst, find what bikzpus is: bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus.\n\nNow, what is fotbpus? fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus.\n\nWhat is sucbpus? sucbpus is wefwpus.\n\nWhat is wefwpus? wefwpus is disjpus and bubjpus.\n\nWhat is disjpus? disjpus is posjpus. Also, disjpus is fewfpus. But from above, disjpus is posjpus, and disjpus is fewfpus? That might mean disjpus belongs to both, but we need to see.\n\nActually, from the statements: disjpus is posjpus. and disjpus is fewfpus. So disjpus is contained in posjpus and also in fewfpus? But that might not be consistent if posjpus and fewfpus are different categories. But since it's containment, it could be that disjpus is in multiple categories.\n\nBut for transitivity, we need to see the chains.\n\nAlso, from wefwpus is disjpus and bubjpus, so wefwpus contains disjpus.\n\nBut wefwpus is sucbpus, so sucbpus contains wefwpus, which contains disjpus.\n\nNow, fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus, so fotbpus contains sucbpus, which contains wefwpus, which contains disjpus.\n\nBut I need to connect to babbpus.\n\nI have femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus, and mifkpus is babbpus, so femfpus is babbpus.\n\nNow, is there a connection between bikzpus and femfpus?\n\nbikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus.\n\nfotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus.\n\nsucbpus is wefwpus.\n\nwefwpus is disjpus and bubjpus.\n\ndisjpus is fewfpus? disjpus is posjpus and also disjpus is fewfpus? Let's see the statements.\n\nFrom given: disjpus is posjpus. and disjpus is fewfpus. So disjpus is contained in fewfpus.\n\nAlso, fewfpus is qiwrpus and zonqpus.\n\nAnd qiwrpus is hezqpus.\n\nhezqpus is pofhpus.\n\npofhpus is bokhpus and leghpus.\n\nbokhpus is gozppus.\n\ngozppus is kimcpus and nipdpus.\n\nkimcpus is jadypus.\n\njadypus is hankpus and kaqgpus and qacvpus.\n\nhankpus is sadhpus. and hankpus is cedspus and sucxpus.\n\nsadhpus is japvpus.\n\njapvpus is tagkpus and bepnpus and beyzpus.\n\ntagkpus is coxvpus and camppus.\n\ncoxvpus is yuzgpus.\n\nyuzgpus is kewqpus and qivppus.\n\nkewqpus is dubwpus.\n\ndubwpus is zeffpus.\n\nzeffpus is fiqrpus.\n\nfiqrpus is maxhpus and qifbpus.\n\nmaxhpus is rufppus and webgpus.\n\nrufppus is katkpus.\n\nkatkpus is dusgpus.\n\ndusgpus is qonlpus and misppus.\n\nqonlpus is xadrpus.\n\nxadrpus is jifspus.\n\nThis seems messy, and I don't see a connection to femfpus yet.\n\nI also have jebypus is femfpus.\n\nAnd fozjpus is jebypus.\n\nAnd miwjpus is fozjpus and ficppus.\n\nAnd yilzpus is miwjpus and hukgpus.\n\nAnd jaczpus is yilzpus.\n\nAnd sanfpus is jaczpus and gesqpus and dimmpus.\n\nAnd jipwpus is sanfpus.\n\nAnd maxhpus is jipwpus? maxhpus is rufppus and webgpus, but also from fiqrpus is maxhpus and qifbpus, and maxhpus is jipwpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom given: maxhpus is jipwpus. Yes, it says \"maxhpus is jipwpus\" but also \"maxhpus is rufppus and webgpus\" – so maxhpus contains rufppus and webgpus, and also is jipwpus? That might mean maxhpus belongs to jipwpus? But from the statement, \"maxhpus is jipwpus\" means maxhpus belongs to jipwpus category.\n\nSimilarly, \"maxhpus is rufppus and webgpus\" means maxhpus contains rufppus and webgpus? No, let's read the note: \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B. So when we say \"A is B\", it could mean A is a subset of B or A is an element of B? The note says \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\", which is ambiguous.\n\nLet's read the note carefully: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\"\n\nSo, \"A is B\" can mean either that A is a member of category B, or that A is a subset of category B. But in set theory, if A is contained in B, it means A is a subset of B, but if A belongs to B, it means A is an element of B.\n\nThis is confusing because in the statements, we have both types.\n\nFor example, \"mifkpus is babbpus\" likely means mifkpus is a type of babbpus, so mifkpus belongs to babbpus category.\n\nBut \"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" likely means bikzpus consists of fotbpus and jutypus, so bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus, meaning fotbpus and jutypus are parts of bikzpus.\n\nSo, the direction matters.\n\nIn the note, it says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B. So for example, if A is B and it means A belongs to B, then B is a category, and A is an instance. If A is B and it means A is contained in B, then A is a subset of B.\n\nBut in the statements, we need to interpret each \"is\" based on context.\n\nLook at the statements: \"mifkpus is babbpus\" – here, mifkpus is likely an instance, so it belongs to babbpus.\n\n\"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" – here, bikzpus is composed of fotbpus and jutypus, so bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus, so for this, \"is\" means \"contains\" or \"is made of\", so A is B means A has parts B, so A is contained in B? No, if A contains B, then B is contained in A, so \"A is B\" would mean A contains B, which is the opposite of belonging.\n\nI think there is inconsistency in the interpretation.\n\nLet's read the note again: \"A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'\"\n\nSo, if A belongs to B, then A is an element of B.\n\nIf A is contained in B, then A is a subset of B.\n\nBut in the statement \"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\", if we interpret \"is\" as \"contains\", then it would be that bikzpus contains fotbpus, so fotbpus is contained in bikzpus, so for A is B, if B is fotbpus, then A is B means A contains B, so A is the container, so B is contained in A, so \"A is B\" means that B is contained in A? That doesn't match the note.\n\nPerhaps for this statement, \"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" means that bikzpus is composed of fotbpus and jutypus, so fotbpus and jutypus are parts of bikzpus, so bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus, so from the perspective of categories, bikzpus is a category that includes fotbpus and jutypus, so fotbpus belongs to bikzpus? But the statement says \"bikzpus is fotbpus\" which would mean bikzpus belongs to fotbpus, which is not right.\n\nI think there is a problem with the notation.\n\nLet's look at other statements: \"sucbpus is wefwpus\" – likely means sucbpus contains wefwpus or something.\n\nFrom \"fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus\" and \"sucbpus is wefwpus\", so if fotbpus contains sucbpus, and sucbpus contains wefwpus, then fotbpus contains wefwpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"wefwpus is disjpus and bubjpus\" so wefwpus contains disjpus and bubjpus.\n\nSo, in general, when \"A is B\" appears with multiple things, it seems that A is composed of B, so A contains B.\n\nBut when \"A is B\" appears with a single thing, it might mean A belongs to B.\n\nFor example, \"x is bikzpus\" – x is a single entity, so x belongs to bikzpus category.\n\n\"mifkpus is babbpus\" – mifkpus belongs to babbpus category.\n\n\"buldpus is babmpus\" – buldpus belongs to babmpus category.\n\n\"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" – here, bikzpus is composed of fotbpus and jutypus, so fotbpus and jutypus are parts of bikzpus, so fotbpus belongs to bikzpus category? But the statement says \"bikzpus is fotbpus\" which would imply bikzpus belongs to fotbpus, but that doesn't make sense. So perhaps for this case, \"is\" means \"consists of\" or \"includes\", so it's that bikzpus contains fotbpus.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I need to interpret each statement based on the context.\n\nLet's list the statements where \"A is B\" with multiple Bs, it likely means A contains B or A is made up of B.\n\nWhere \"A is B\" with a single B, it likely means A belongs to B.\n\nBut in the note, it says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B, so for A belongs to B, B is the category, for A contained in B, A is the category and B is the item? No.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of sets.\n\nSuppose each pus is a set or an element.\n\nWhen we say \"A is B\", it means that A is a subset of B or A is an element of B.\n\nBut from the statements, when we have \"A is B and C\", it means that A = B ∪ C or something.\n\nLet's look at the statement: \"japvpus is tagkpus and bepnpus and beyzpus\" – this likely means that japvpus consists of tagkpus, bepnpus, and beyzpus, so tagkpus, bepnpus, and beyzpus are subsets of japvpus or elements? Probably, japvpus is a category that contains tagkpus, bepnpus, and beyzpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"sanjpus is jaczpus and gesqpus and dimmpus\" so sanjpus contains jaczpus, gesqpus, and dimmpus.\n\nSo, in general, if \"A is B and C\" then A contains B and C, so B and C are contained in A.\n\nTherefore, for \"A is B\", if B is a single item, it means A belongs to B, so B contains A.\n\nIf \"A is B and C\" then A contains B and C, so B and C belong to A.\n\nThis seems consistent with the note: \"A is B\" means A belongs to B (so B contains A) or A is contained in B (so A contains B)? The note says \"A is contained in B\" which means A is a subset of B, so B contains A.\n\nBut in the case where \"A is B and C\", it means A contains B and C, so B is contained in A, so for A is B, if B is multiple, it means B is contained in A, which is the opposite of A is contained in B.\n\nSo to clarify, let's define:\n\nWhen we say \"A is B\", it can mean:\n\n- A belongs to B, so A is an element of B, or\n\n- A is contained in B, so A is a subset of B.\n\nBut in the statements, when B is a list, it means that A contains those things, so A is a set that contains B, so for each B_i, B_i is contained in A, so A is the container.\n\nSo for \"A is B and C\", it means that B is contained in A and C is contained in A, so A contains B and C.\n\nFor \"A is B\" where B is single, it usually means A belongs to B, so B contains A.\n\nSo in summary, for a statement \"A is B\":\n\n- If B is a single entity, then A belongs to B, so B contains A.\n\n- If B is multiple entities connected with \"and\", then A contains B, so A contains each of those entities.\n\nThis seems to be the pattern in the given information.\n\nFor example, \"x is bikzpus\" - B is single, so x belongs to bikzpus, so bikzpus contains x.\n\n\"mifkpus is babbpus\" - B is single, so mifkpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus contains mifkpus.\n\n\"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" - B is multiple, so bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus.\n\n\"fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus\" - fotbpus contains sucbpus and xetvpus.\n\n\"sucbpus is wefwpus\" - here, wefwpus is single, so sucbpus belongs to wefwpus? But from earlier, fotbpus contains sucbpus, and if sucbpus belongs to wefwpus, then wefwpus contains sucbpus, but then fotbpus contains sucbpus, which is contained in wefwpus, so fotbpus contains wefwpus? Let's see the statement: \"sucbpus is wefwpus\" - since wefwpus is single, this should mean that sucbpus belongs to wefwpus, so wefwpus contains sucbpus.\n\nBut from \"fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus\", so fotbpus contains sucbpus, so sucbpus is contained in fotbpus and also sucbpus belongs to wefwpus, so wefwpus contains sucbpus. So sucbpus is in both fotbpus and wefwpus, which is possible if fotbpus and wefwpus have overlap.\n\nBut then \"wefwpus is disjpus and bubjpus\" - so wefwpus contains disjpus and bubjpus.\n\nSo for \"sucbpus is wefwpus\", it means sucbpus is an element of wefwpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"disjpus is posjpus\" - disjpus belongs to posjpus.\n\n\"disjpus is fewfpus\" - disjpus belongs to fewfpus.\n\nSo let's adopt this interpretation.\n\nFor any statement \"A is B\":\n\n- If B is a single word, then A belongs to B, so B contains A.\n\n- If B is multiple words with \"and\", then A contains B, so A contains each of the B items.\n\nNow, back to the question: Is x is babbpus and babmpus?\n\nx is bikzpus, so x belongs to bikzpus.\n\nWe need to know if bikzpus is contained in babbpus and babmpus? Or since x belongs to bikzpus, if bikzpus is a subset of babbpus, then x belongs to babbpus.\n\nSimilarly for babmpus.\n\nSo, we need to find if bikzpus is a subset of babbpus and bikzpus is a subset of babmpus.\n\nSince bikzpus is a category, we need to see if all elements of bikzpus are in babbpus and in babmpus.\n\nBut from the statements, we might find that bikzpus is related to other categories that are related to babbpus.\n\nAlternatively, we might find that some element of bikzpus is in babbpus, but that doesn't mean all elements are.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus and babmpus\" which means x belongs to babbpus and x belongs to babmpus.\n\nSince x belongs to bikzpus, if we can show that bikzpus is a subset of babbpus, then x is in babbpus. Similarly for babmpus.\n\nBut if bikzpus is not a subset, but x might be in babbpus through other means, but since we don't know what x is specifically, only that it is in bikzpus, we need to know if all of bikzpus is in babbpus, or if there is a chain that puts x in babbpus.\n\nFrom the statements, we have relationships between categories.\n\nLet's list all statements that might help.\n\nFirst, babbpus: we have mifkpus is babbpus, so mifkpus belongs to babbpus.\n\nAlso, femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus, so femfpus contains mifkpus and vixypus, so since mifkpus belongs to babbpus, and femfpus contains mifkpus, but femfpus itself may not belong to babbpus unless stated.\n\nBut from \"jebypus is femfpus\" - jebypus belongs to femfpus? Or since femfpus is a container, jebypus is an element of femfpus?\n\nLet's see: \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" so femfpus contains mifkpus and vixypus, so mifkpus is in femfpus, and vixypus is in femfpus.\n\nThen \"jebypus is femfpus\" - here femfpus is single, so jebypus belongs to femfpus, so femfpus contains jebypus? But already femfpus contains mifkpus and vixypus, so now femfpus also contains jebypus? But from the statement \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\", it means that femfpus consists of mifkpus and vixypus, so perhaps femfpus has only these two elements, but then \"jebypus is femfpus\" would mean jebypus is femfpus, which contradicts because femfpus is a set with elements, so jebypus cannot be the set itself.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps when we say \"A is B\" with multiple B, it means that A is exactly the set of B, so A = {B1, B2, ...}.\n\nThen when we say \"C is A\" with single A, it means C is an element of A.\n\nSo for \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\", it means femfpus = {mifkpus, vixypus}.\n\nThen \"jebypus is femfpus\" means jebypus is an element of femfpus, so jebypus is either mifkpus or vixypus, but from other statements, jebypus is likely different, so this might be inconsistency.\n\nLet's look at another statement: \"hankpus is sadhpus\" and \"hankpus is cedspus and sucxpus\" – so if \"hankpus is cedspus and sucxpus\" means hankpus = {cedspus, sucxpus}, then \"hankpus is sadhpus\" means hankpus is an element of sadhpus, so sadhpus contains hankpus, but hankpus is a set, so it's possible.\n\nBut then \"sadhpus is japvpus\" so sadhpus belongs to japvpus? Or sadhpus contains japvpus? From \"sadhpus is japvpus\" since japvpus is single, sadhpus belongs to japvpus, so japvpus contains sadhpus.\n\nBut from \"hankpus is sadhpus\" so sadhpus contains hankpus, so japvpus contains sadhpus contains hankpus.\n\nAlso from \"hankpus is cedspus and sucxpus\" so hankpus contains cedspus and sucxpus.\n\nSo for \"A is B\" with single B, A belongs to B.\n\nWith multiple B, A contains B.\n\nSo for the statement \"jebypus is femfpus\", since femfpus is single, jebypus belongs to femfpus, so femfpus contains jebypus.\n\nBut from \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\", femfpus contains mifkpus and vixypus, so femfpus has at least mifkpus, vixypus, and jebypus? But the statement \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" might mean that femfpus consists of only mifkpus and vixypus, so if jebypus is added, it contradicts.\n\nPerhaps the statement \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" means that mifkpus and vixypus are the components of femfpus, but femfpus may have other elements, but typically in such puzzles, \"A is B and C\" means that A is composed of B and C, so A contains B and C, and possibly other things, but from the way it's written, it might be that A is exactly the set {B,C} or the collection.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's assume that when \"A is B and C\" it means that A contains B and C, so B and C are subsets of A or elements of A, but since B and C are individuals, they are elements of A.\n\nSo for \"femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\", it means that mifkpus and vixypus are elements of femfpus.\n\nThen \"jebypus is femfpus\" means that jebypus is an element of femfpus, so femfpus has elements mifkpus, vixypus, and jebypus.\n\nSimilarly, \" fozyus is jebypus\" means fozyus belongs to jebypus? But let's see: \"fozjpus is jebypus\" so since jebypus is single, fozjpus belongs to jebypus, so jebypus contains fozjpus.\n\nBut from above, jebypus is an element of femfpus, so jebypus is a set that contains fozjpus.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but for the purpose of this problem, we might only need to find connections between categories.\n\nFor the question, we need to see if x is in babbpus and in babmpus.\n\nx is in bikzpus.\n\nSo let's find what bikzpus is related to.\n\nFrom \"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" so bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus. So fotbpus is an element of bikzpus, and jutypus is an element of bikzpus.\n\nNow, fotbpus is sucbpus and xetvpus, so fotbpus contains sucbpus and xetvpus.\n\nsucbpus is wefwpus, so sucbpus belongs to wefwpus, so wefwpus contains sucbpus.\n\nwefwpus is disjpus and bubjpus, so wefwpus contains disjpus and bubjpus.\n\ndisjpus is posjpus, so disjpus belongs to posjpus, so posjpus contains disjpus.\n\ndisjpus is fewfpus, so disjpus belongs to fewfpus, so fewfpus contains disjpus.\n\nfewfpus is qiwrpus and zonqpus, so fewfpus contains qiwrpus and zonqpus.\n\nqiwrpus is hezqpus, so qiwrpus belongs to hezqpus, so hezqpus contains qiwrpus.\n\nhezqpus is pofhpus, so hezqpus belongs to pofhpus, so pofhpus contains hezqpus.\n\npofhpus is bokhpus and leghpus, so pofhpus contains bokhpus and leghpus.\n\nbokhpus is gozppus, so bokhpus belongs to gozppus, so gozppus contains bokhpus.\n\ngozppus is kimcpus and nipdpus, so gozppus contains kimcpus and nipdpus.\n\nkimcpus is jadypus, so kimcpus belongs to jadypus, so jadypus contains kimcpus.\n\njadypus is hankpus and kaqgpus and qacvpus, so jadypus contains hankpus, kaqgpus, and qacvpus.\n\nhankpus is sadhpus, so hankpus belongs to sadhpus, so sadhpus contains hankpus.\n\nhankpus is cedspus and sucxpus, so hankpus contains cedspus and sucxpus.\n\nsadhpus is japvpus, so sadhpus belongs to japvpus, so japvpus contains sadhpus.\n\njapvpus is tagkpus and bepnpus and beyzpus, so japvpus contains tagkpus, bepnpus, and beyzpus.\n\ntagkpus is coxvpus and camppus, so tagkpus contains coxvpus and camppus.\n\ncoxvpus is yuzgpus, so coxvpus belongs to yuzgpus, so yuzgpus contains coxvpus.\n\nyuzgpus is kewqpus and qivppus, so yuzgpus contains kewqpus and qivppus.\n\nkewqpus is dubwpus, so kewqpus belongs to dubwpus, so dubwpus contains kewqpus.\n\ndubwpus is zeffpus, so dubwpus belongs to zeffpus, so zeffpus contains dubwpus.\n\nzeffpus is fiqrpus, so zeffpus belongs to fiqrpus, so fiqrpus contains zeffpus.\n\nfiqrpus is maxhpus and qifbpus, so fiqrpus contains maxhpus and qifbpus.\n\nmaxhpus is rufppus and webgpus, so maxhpus contains rufppus and webgpus.\n\nmaxhpus is jipwpus, so maxhpus belongs to jipwpus, so jipwpus contains maxhpus.\n\nrufppus is katkpus, so rufppus belongs to katkpus, so katkpus contains rufppus.\n\nkatkpus is dusgpus, so katkpus belongs to dusgpus, so dusgpus contains katkpus.\n\ndusgpus is qonlpus and misppus, so dusgpus contains qonlpus and misppus.\n\nqonlpus is xadrpus, so qonlpus belongs to xadrpus, so xadrpus contains qonlpus.\n\nxadrpus is jifspus, so xadrpus belongs to jifspus, so jifspus contains xadrpus.\n\nThis is a long chain, and it doesn't seem to connect to babbpus.\n\nNow, we also have other statements.\n\nFrom above, we have femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus, so femfpus contains mifkpus and vixypus.\n\nmifkpus is babbpus, so mifkpus belongs to babbpus.\n\nSo since mifkpus is in femfpus, and mifkpus is in babbpus, but that doesn't mean femfpus is in babbpus.\n\nAlso, jebypus is femfpus, so jebypus belongs to femfpus.\n\nfozjpus is jebypus, so fozjpus belongs to jebypus.\n\nmiwjpus is fozjpus and ficppus, so miwjpus contains fozjpus and ficppus.\n\nyilzpus is miwjpus and hukgpus, so yilzpus contains miwjpus and hukgpus.\n\njaczpus is yilzpus, so jaczpus belongs to yilzpus, so yilzpus contains jaczpus.\n\njaczpus is wefjpus and hisnpus, so jaczpus contains wefjpus and hisnpus.\n\nwefjpus is rapnpus, so wefjpus belongs to rapnpus, so rapnpus contains wefjpus.\n\nwefjpus is hudzpus, so wefjpus belongs to hudzpus, so hudzpus contains wefjpus.\n\nhudzpus is vatlpus, so hudzpus belongs to vatlpus, so vatlpus contains hudzpus.\n\nvatlpus is yivtpus and vugfpus, so vatlpus contains yivtpus and vugfpus.\n\nyivtpus is wudlpus and sowzpus, so yivtpus contains wudlpus and sowzpus.\n\nyivtpus is vuqnpus, so yivtpus belongs to vuqnpus, so vuqnpus contains yivtpus.\n\nyivtpus is buldpus, so yivtpus belongs to buldpus, so buldpus contains yivtpus.\n\nbuldpus is babmpus, so buldpus belongs to babmpus, so babmpus contains buldpus.\n\nSo from above, yivtpus is in buldpus, and buldpus is in babmpus, so yivtpus is in babmpus.\n\nBut we need x to be in babmpus.\n\nx is in bikzpus.\n\nIs there a connection between bikzpus and yivtpus?\n\nFrom bikzpus, we have fotbpus and jutypus.\n\nfotbpus contains sucbpus and xetvpus.\n\nsucbpus is wefwpus, so wefwpus contains sucbpus.\n\nwefwpus contains disjpus and bubjpus.\n\ndisjpus is fewfpus, so fewfpus contains disjpus.\n\nfewfpus contains qiwrpus and zonqpus.\n\nqiwrpus is hezqpus, so hezqpus contains qiwrpus.\n\nhezqpus is pofhpus, so pofhpus contains hezqpus.\n\npofhpus contains bokhpus and leghpus.\n\nbokhpus is gozppus, so gozppus contains bokhpus.\n\ngozppus contains kimcpus and nipdpus.\n\nkimcpus is jadypus, so jadypus contains kimcpus.\n\njadypus contains hankpus, kaqgpus, and qacvpus.\n\nhankpus is sadhpus, so sadhpus contains hankpus.\n\nsadhpus is japvpus, so japvpus contains sadhpus.\n\njapvpus contains tagkpus, bepnpus, and beyzpus.\n\ntagkpus contains coxvpus and camppus.\n\ncoxvpus is yuzgpus, so yuzgpus contains coxvpus.\n\nyuzgpus contains kewqpus and qivppus.\n\nkewqpus is dubwpus, so dubwpus contains kewqpus.\n\ndubwpus is zeffpus, so zeffpus contains dubwpus.\n\nzeffpus is fiqrpus, so fiqrpus contains zeffpus.\n\nfiqrpus contains maxhpus and qifbpus.\n\nmaxhpus contains rufppus and webgpus.\n\nmaxhpus is jipwpus, so jipwpus contains maxhpus.\n\nrufppus is katkpus, so katkpus contains rufppus.\n\nkatkpus is dusgpus, so dusgpus contains katkpus.\n\ndusgpus contains qonlpus and misppus.\n\nqonlpus is xadrpus, so xadrpus contains qonlpus.\n\nxadrpus is jifspus, so jifspus contains xadrpus.\n\nThis doesn't connect to yivtpus.\n\nFrom other side, we have yivtpus is in vatlpus, and vatlpus is in hudzpus, and hudzpus is in wefjpus, and wefjpus is in jaczpus, and jaczpus is in yilzpus, and yilzpus is in miwjpus, and miwjpus is in fozjpus, and fozjpus is in jebypus, and jebypus is in femfpus, and femfpus is in mifkpus? No, femfpus contains mifkpus, so mifkpus is in femfpus.\n\nBut we need to connect to bikzpus.\n\nbikzpus contains fotbpus, which contains sucbpus, etc., but no connection to femfpus or jebypus.\n\nPerhaps from jutypus? But we have no information about jutypus.\n\nFrom the statements, we have \"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" so we have fotbpus and jutypus, but no other mentions of jutypus, so we don't know what jutypus is.\n\nSimilarly, for fotbpus, we have its components, but they don't seem to connect to babbpus or babmpus.\n\nNow, for babbpus, we have mifkpus is babbpus, so anything in mifkpus might be in babbpus, but mifkpus is contained in femfpus, so femfpus contains mifkpus, but femfpus may not be in babbpus.\n\nFrom \" femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" so femfpus has mifkpus, which is in babbpus, but femfpus itself is not necessarily in babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, for x, since x is in bikzpus, and bikzpus doesn't seem related to mifkpus, so x is not in babbpus.\n\nBut let's see if there is any indirect connection.\n\nFrom \" femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" and \"jebypus is femfpus\" so jebypus is in femfpus.\n\n\" fozjpus is jebypus\" so fozjpus is in jebypus.\n\n\" miwjpus is fozjpus and ficppus\" so miwjpus has fozjpus.\n\n\" yilzpus is miwjpus and hukgpus\" so yilzpus has miwjpus.\n\n\" jaczpus is yilzpus\" so jaczpus is in yilzpus.\n\n\" jaczpus is wefjpus and hisnpus\" so jaczpus has wefjpus and hisnpus.\n\n\" wefjpus is hudzpus\" so wefjpus is in hudzpus.\n\n\" hudzpus is vatlpus\" so hudzpus is in vatlpus.\n\n\" vatlpus is yivtpus and vugfpus\" so vatlpus has yivtpus and vugfpus.\n\n\" yivtpus is buldpus\" so yivtpus is in buldpus.\n\n\" buldpus is babmpus\" so buldpus is in babmpus.\n\nSo from this, we have a chain from femfpus to babmpus: femfpus contains jebypus, which contains fozjpus, which is in miwjpus, which is in yilzpus, which contains jaczpus, which contains wefjpus, which is in hudzpus, which is in vatlpus, which contains yivtpus, which is in buldpus, which is in babmpus.\n\nSo anything in femfpus is eventually in babmpus? Not necessarily, because the chain is about containment, but for example, jebypus is in femfpus, so jebypus is in babmpus through the chain? Let's see.\n\njebypus is in femfpus, and from the chain, since jebypus is in femfpus, and then fozjpus is in jebypus, so fozjpus is in jebypus which is in femfpus, but for jebypus itself, is it in babmpus? From the chain, we have that yivtpus is in babmpus, but jebypus is not directly related to yivtpus.\n\nFrom the chain, we have vatlpus contains yivtpus, and vatlpus contains hudzpus, which contains wefjpus, which is in jaczpus, which is in yilzpus, which contains miwjpus, which contains fozjpus, which is in jebypus, so indeed, jebypus is contained in this chain, so since jebypus is in femfpus, and from the chain, jebypus is contained in systems that lead to babmpus, but does that mean that jebypus is in babmpus?\n\nLet's think about sets.\n\nIf A is in B, and B is in C, then A is in C only if the containment is transitive for elements. But here, when we say \"A is in B\" it means A belongs to B, so B is a set containing A.\n\nThen if B is in C, it means B belongs to C, so C is a set containing B, so since A is in B and B is in C, then A is in C only if C contains all elements of B, which it does because B is an element of C, but C may not contain elements of B unless B is a subset of C, but since B is an element of C, C contains B as an element, not necessarily as a subset, so A may not be in C.\n\nFor example, if B = {A}, and C = {B}, then C contains B, but A is not in C because C has only B, not A.\n\nSo in set terms, if A ∈ B and B ∈ C, then A may not be in C.\n\nSo in this case, for jebypus to be in babmpus, we need that babmpus contains jebypus, but from the chain, we have that buldpus contains yivtpus, and buldpus is in babmpus, so babmpus contains buldpus, but buldpus contains yivtpus, so yivtpus is in buldpus, and since buldpus is in babmpus, yivtpus is in babmpus? Similarly, if buldpus contains yivtpus, and babmpus contains buldpus, then since buldpus is a set, and babmpus contains buldpus as an element, then yivtpus is an element of buldpus, but not necessarily an element of babmpus unless babmpus also contains all elements of buldpus, which is not stated.\n\nSo for example, if babmpus = { buldpus }, then buldpus = { yivtpus }, so yivtpus is in buldpus but not in babmpus.\n\nSo to have yivtpus in babmpus, we need that babmpus contains yivtpus, which requires that buldpus is a subset of babmpus or that babmpus contains yivtpus directly.\n\nBut from \"buldpus is babmpus\", it means buldpus belongs to babmpus, so babmpus contains buldpus, but不一定包含 buldpus的元素.\n\nSo in this context, since \" buldpus is babmpus\" means buldpus is an instance of babmpus, so babmpus is a category that includes buldpus, but may not include elements of buldpus.\n\nTherefore, for x to be in babmpus, x must be an instance of babmpus, so x must be buldpus or another instance, but from the information, we have only buldpus as babmpus, so unless x is buldpus, x may not be in babmpus.\n\nSimilarly for babbpus, only mifkpus is babbpus, so unless x is mifkpus, x may not be in babbpus.\n\nNow, x is bikzpus, and from the chains, bikzpus doesn't appear to be mifkpus or buldpus.\n\nSo likely, x is not babbpus and not babmpus.\n\nBut let's see if there is any statement that directly says bikzpus is related to mifkpus or buldpus.\n\nFrom the given, we have \" femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" so mifkpus is in femfpus.\n\nAnd \" jebypus is femfpus\" so jebypus is in femfpus.\n\nAnd \" fozjpus is jebypus\" so fozjpus is in jebypus.\n\nAnd \" miwjpus is fozjpus and ficppus\" so fozjpus is in miwjpus.\n\nAnd \" yilzpus is miwjpus and hukgpus\" so miwjpus is in yilzpus.\n\nAnd \" jaczpus is yilzpus\" so jaczpus is in yilzpus.\n\nAnd \" wefjpus is jaczpus\" from \" jaczpus is wefjpus and hisnpus\" so jaczpus contains wefjpus, so wefjpus is in jaczpus.\n\nAnd \" wefjpus is hudzpus\" so wefjpus is in hudzpus.\n\nAnd \" hudzpus is vatlpus\" so hudzpus is in vatlpus.\n\nAnd \" vatlpus is yivtpus and vugfpus\" so yivtpus is in vatlpus.\n\nAnd \" yivtpus is buldpus\" so yivtpus is in buldpus.\n\nBut from this, we have that fozjpus is in miwjpus, etc., but no connection to bikzpus.\n\nbikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus, and fotbpus contains sucbpus, etc., but no mention of femfpus or jebypus in that chain.\n\nSo bikzpus is not connected to mifkpus or buldpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is in bikzpus, and bikzpus is not in babbpus or babmpus, x is not in babbpus and not in babmpus.\n\nSo the statement \"x is babbpus and babmpus\" is false.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any other statement.\n\nWe have \"x is bikzpus\" and that's all.\n\nAlso, from \"yivtpus is buldpus\" and \"buldpus is babmpus\", but yivtpus is not x.\n\nSimilarly, \"mifkpus is babbpus\" but mifkpus is not x.\n\nSo indeed, x is not babbpus and not babmpus.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be false.\n\nSo for the question: Is it true or false or unknown: x is babbpus and babmpus?\n\nIt is false.",

    "From the statements, we have \"bikzpus is fotbpus and jutypus\" so we have fotbpus and jutypus, but no other mentions of jutypus, so we don't know what jutypus is.",
    "Similarly, for fotbpus, we have its components, but they don't seem to connect to babbpus or babmpus.",
    "Now, for babbpus, we have mifkpus is babbpus, so anything in mifkpus might be in babbpus, but mifkpus is contained in femfpus, so femfpus contains mifkpus, but femfpus may not be in babbpus.",
    "From \" femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" so femfpus has mifkpus, which is in babbpus, but femfpus itself is not necessarily in babbpus.",
    "Similarly, for x, since x is in bikzpus, and bikzpus doesn't seem related to mifkpus, so x is not in babbpus.",
    "But let's see if there is any indirect connection.",
    "From \" femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" and \"jebypus is femfpus\" so jebypus is in femfpus.",
    "\" fozjpus is jebypus\" so fozjpus is in jebypus.",
    "\" miwjpus is fozjpus and ficppus\" so miwjpus has fozjpus.",
    "\" yilzpus is miwjpus and hukgpus\" so yilzpus has miwjpus.",
    "\" jaczpus is yilzpus\" so jaczpus is in yilzpus.",
    "\" jaczpus is wefjpus and hisnpus\" so jaczpus has wefjpus and hisnpus.",
    "\" wefjpus is hudzpus\" so wefjpus is in hudzpus.",
    "\" hudzpus is vatlpus\" so hudzpus is in vatlpus.",
    "\" vatlpus is yivtpus and vugfpus\" so vatlpus has yivtpus and vugfpus.",
    "\" yivtpus is buldpus\" so yivtpus is in buldpus.",
    "\" buldpus is babmpus\" so buldpus is in babmpus.",
    "So from this, we have a chain from femfpus to babmpus: femfpus contains jebypus, which contains fozjpus, which is in miwjpus, which is in yilzpus, which contains jaczpus, which contains wefjpus, which is in hudzpus, which is in vatlpus, which contains yivtpus, which is in buldpus, which is in babmpus.",
    "So anything in femfpus is eventually in babmpus?",
    "Not necessarily, because the chain is about containment, but for example, jebypus is in femfpus, so jebypus is in babmpus through the chain?",
    "Let's see.",
    "jebypus is in femfpus, and from the chain, since jebypus is in femfpus, and then fozjpus is in jebypus, so fozjpus is in jebypus which is in femfpus, but for jebypus itself, is it in babmpus?",
    "From the chain, we have that yivtpus is in babmpus, but jebypus is not directly related to yivtpus.",
    "From the chain, we have vatlpus contains yivtpus, and vatlpus contains hudzpus, which contains wefjpus, which is in jaczpus, which is in yilzpus, which contains miwjpus, which contains fozjpus, which is in jebypus, so indeed, jebypus is contained in this chain, so since jebypus is in femfpus, and from the chain, jebypus is contained in systems that lead to babmpus, but does that mean that jebypus is in babmpus?",
    "Let's think about sets.",
    "If A is in B, and B is in C, then A is in C only if the containment is transitive for elements.",
    "But here, when we say \"A is in B\" it means A belongs to B, so B is a set containing A.",
    "Then if B is in C, it means B belongs to C, so C is a set containing B, so since A is in B and B is in C, then A is in C only if C contains all elements of B, which it does because B is an element of C, but C may not contain elements of B unless B is a subset of C, but since B is an element of C, C contains B as an element, not necessarily as a subset, so A may not be in C.",
    "For example, if B = {A}, and C = {B}, then C contains B, but A is not in C because C has only B, not A.",
    "So in set terms, if A ∈ B and B ∈ C, then A may not be in C.",
    "So in this case, for jebypus to be in babmpus, we need that babmpus contains jebypus, but from the chain, we have that buldpus contains yivtpus, and buldpus is in babmpus, so babmpus contains buldpus, but buldpus contains yivtpus, so yivtpus is in buldpus, and since buldpus is in babmpus, yivtpus is in babmpus?",
    "Similarly, if buldpus contains yivtpus, and babmpus contains buldpus, then since buldpus is a set, and babmpus contains buldpus as an element, then yivtpus is an element of buldpus, but not necessarily an element of babmpus unless babmpus also contains all elements of buldpus, which is not stated.",
    "So for example, if babmpus = { buldpus }, then buldpus = { yivtpus }, so yivtpus is in buldpus but not in babmpus.",
    "So to have yivtpus in babmpus, we need that babmpus contains yivtpus, which requires that buldpus is a subset of babmpus or that babmpus contains yivtpus directly.",
    "But from \"buldpus is babmpus\", it means buldpus belongs to babmpus, so babmpus contains buldpus, but不一定包含 buldpus的元素.",
    "So in this context, since \" buldpus is babmpus\" means buldpus is an instance of babmpus, so babmpus is a category that includes buldpus, but may not include elements of buldpus.",
    "Therefore, for x to be in babmpus, x must be an instance of babmpus, so x must be buldpus or another instance, but from the information, we have only buldpus as babmpus, so unless x is buldpus, x may not be in babmpus.",
    "Similarly for babbpus, only mifkpus is babbpus, so unless x is mifkpus, x may not be in babbpus.",
    "Now, x is bikzpus, and from the chains, bikzpus doesn't appear to be mifkpus or buldpus.",
    "So likely, x is not babbpus and not babmpus.",
    "But let's see if there is any statement that directly says bikzpus is related to mifkpus or buldpus.",
    "From the given, we have \" femfpus is mifkpus and vixypus\" so mifkpus is in femfpus.",
    "And \" jebypus is femfpus\" so jebypus is in femfpus.",
    "And \" fozjpus is jebypus\" so fozjpus is in jebypus.",
    "And \" miwjpus is fozjpus and ficppus\" so fozjpus is in miwjpus.",
    "And \" yilzpus is miwjpus and hukgpus\" so miwjpus is in yilzpus.",
    "And \" jaczpus is yilzpus\" so jaczpus is in yilzpus.",
    "And \" wefjpus is jaczpus\" from \" jaczpus is wefjpus and hisnpus\" so jaczpus contains wefjpus, so wefjpus is in jaczpus.",
    "And \" wefjpus is hudzpus\" so wefjpus is in hudzpus.",
    "And \" hudzpus is vatlpus\" so hudzpus is in vatlpus.",
    "And \" vatlpus is yivtpus and vugfpus\" so yivtpus is in vatlpus.",
    "And \" yivtpus is buldpus\" so yivtpus is in buldpus.",
    "But from this, we have that fozjpus is in miwjpus, etc.",
    ", but no connection to bikzpus.",
    "bikzpus contains fotbpus and jutypus, and fotbpus contains sucbpus, etc.",
    ", but no mention of femfpus or jebypus in that chain.",
    "So bikzpus is not connected to mifkpus or buldpus.",
    "Therefore, since x is in bikzpus, and bikzpus is not in babbpus or babmpus, x is not in babbpus and not in babmpus.",
    "So the statement \"x is babbpus and babmpus\" is false.",
    "But let's confirm if there is any other statement.",
    "We have \"x is bikzpus\" and that's all.",
    "Also, from \"yivtpus is buldpus\" and \"buldpus is babmpus\", but yivtpus is not x.",
    "Similarly, \"mifkpus is babbpus\" but mifkpus is not x.",
    "So indeed, x is not babbpus and not babmpus.",

For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nIt is false.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

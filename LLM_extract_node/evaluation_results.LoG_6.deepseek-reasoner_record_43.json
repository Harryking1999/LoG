The question is: Is it true or false or unknown that x is babgpus or babrpus or babspus?\n\nThe given information is:\n\n- yawbpus is babspus and cipfpus.\n\n- sihdpus is xekspus.\n\n- x is gegmpus.\n\n- yawbpus is cadypus and zarnpus.\n\n- xekspus is yawbpus.\n\n- gegmpus is sihdpus.\n\nNote that \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B, not that A equals B. So, it's about set membership or subset relations.\n\nI need to find out if x is in one of the categories: babgpus, babrpus, or babspus. But looking at the information, babgpus and babrpus are not mentioned anywhere. Only babspus is mentioned. So, I might need to see if x is connected to babspus through other categories.\n\nLet me list out all the categories and entities mentioned:\n\nEntities: yawbpus, sihdpus, x, xekspus, gegmpus\n\nCategories: babspus, cipfpus, xekspus, cadypus, zarnpus, gegmpus, sihdpus\n\nFrom the statements:\n\n- yawbpus is babspus and cipfpus. So yawbpus ∈ babspus and yawbpus ∈ cipfpus.\n\n- sihdpus is xekspus. So sihdpus ∈ xekspus.\n\n- x is gegmpus. So x ∈ gegmpus.\n\n- yawbpus is cadypus and zarnpus. So yawbpus ∈ cadypus and yawbpus ∈ zarnpus.\n\n- xekspus is yawbpus. So xekspus ∈ yawbpus.\n\n- gegmpus is sihdpus. So gegmpus ∈ sihdpus.\n\nNow, I need to see if x is in babspus or babgpus or babrpus. Since babgpus and babrpus are not mentioned, it might be unknown, but I need to see if x is related to babspus.\n\nI have x ∈ gegmpus, and gegmpus ∈ sihdpus, so x ∈ sihdpus because if gegmpus is contained in sihdpus, then any member of gegmpus is also in sihdpus.\n\nSimilarly, sihdpus ∈ xekspus, so x ∈ xekspus.\n\nAnd xekspus ∈ yawbpus, so x ∈ yawbpus.\n\nNow, yawbpus ∈ babspus, so since x ∈ yawbpus, then x ∈ babspus.\n\nSo, x is in babspus.\n\nThe question is whether x is babgpus or babrpus or babspus. Since x is babspus, that means it is true that x is one of them, specifically babspus.\n\nBut the question says \"or\", so if x is babspus, then it is true that x is babspus, so the statement \"x is babgpus or babrpus or babspus\" is true because one of the conditions is satisfied.\n\nSo, it should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any trick here. The categories babgpus and babrpus are not mentioned, so we don't know if x is in them, but since x is in babspus, the \"or\" statement is true.\n\nAlso, from the reasoning:\n\nx ∈ gegmpus\n\ngegmpus ∈ sihdpus, so x ∈ sihdpus\n\nsihdpus ∈ xekspus, so x ∈ xekspus\n\nxekspus ∈ yawbpus, so x ∈ yawbpus\n\nyawbpus ∈ babspus, so x ∈ babspus\n\nTherefore, x is babspus.\n\nSo, for the question, x is babspus, which is one of the options, so it is true.\n\nThe question is \"x is babgpus or babrpus or babspus?\" and since x is babspus, it is true.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me make sure about the relationships. The \"is\" relation might be transitive in terms of membership, but since it's about belonging, if A is B and B is C, then A is C, which seems reasonable from the context.\n\nFor example, from gegmpus is sihdpus and sihdpus is xekspus, then gegmpus is xekspus? But we don't have direct statement, but since gegmpus is contained in sihdpus and sihdpus contained in xekspus, then gegmpus is contained in xekspus, so x, which is in gegmpus, is in xekspus.\n\nSimilarly, xekspus is yawbpus, so xekspus contained in yawbpus, so x in yawbpus.\n\nAnd yawbpus is babspus, so yawbpus contained in babspus, so x in babspus.\n\nSo, yes, it seems correct.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babspus, so the or statement is true.",

For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nTherefore, it is true that x is babspus, so the or statement is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

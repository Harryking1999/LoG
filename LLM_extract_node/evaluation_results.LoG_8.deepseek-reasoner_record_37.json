And ligcpus is vawdpus and weyqpus and boygpus: \"ligcpus is vawdpus and weyqpus and boygpus\". And nosypus is ligcpus: \"nosypus is ligcpus\".

But this seems long, and I need babbpus and babcpus.\n\nI recall that babbpus is part of ziwlpus, and ziwlpus is from qedjpus, which is from fermpus, which is from yawdpus, which is from sozfpus, which is from cendpus, which is from wamvpus, which is from moqxpus, which is from fotjpus, which is from voyvpus, which is from mechpus, which is from keyjpus, which is from puxmpus, which is from qastpus, which is from jujlpus, which is from dopfpus, which is from pirzpus, which is from xaqmpus, which is from tunnpus, which is from qeylpus, which is from qabvpus, which is from balrpus, which is from dapmpus, which is from foydpus, which is from xidspus, which is from sunspus, which is from vawdpus, which is from ligcpus, which is from nosypus, which is x. So, ultimately, x is connected to ziwlpus through this chain?

And ziwlpus is babbpus and pozkpus. Therefore, since x is ultimately ziwlpus through this long chain, x is babbpus.\n\nBut is this correct? I need to ensure that the \"is\" relationship is transitive. Since \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, and if B is C, then A is C, so yes, it should be transitive. So, from x to ziwlpus, we have a chain, so x is ziwlpus, and since ziwlpus is babbpus, x is babbpus.\n\nNow, for babcpus, we have \"bavdpus is babcpus\".

So, through this chain, x is bavdpus, and since bavdpus is babcpus, x is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is both babbpus and babcpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any contradictions or missing links.\n\nFirst, for babbpus: we have x is nosypus, and nosypus is ligcpus, etc., all the way to ziwlpus, which is babbpus.

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the relationships. \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, it's about set membership or hierarchy.\n\nLet me list out all the given statements:\n\n1. fucspus is sikzpus. So, fucspus ∈ sikzpus.\n\n2. sikzpus is domdpus. So, sikzpus ∈ domdpus.\n\n3. domdpus is kiqzpus and wapqpus. This might mean that domdpus contains kiqzpus and wapqpus, or that domdpus is composed of kiqzpus and wapqpus. But since \"is\" means belongs to or contained in, I think it means that domdpus is a subset of kiqzpus and wapqpus? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, if A is B, then A is an element of B or A is a subset of B? The phrasing is ambiguous. But in common usage in such puzzles, \"A is B\" often means that A is a type of B or A is in B, so B is a category that contains A.\n\nLet me look at the statements: \"domdpus is kiqzpus and wapqpus\". This seems odd because if domdpus is kiqzpus, that would mean domdpus belongs to kiqzpus, but then it also is wapqpus? That might imply that kiqzpus and wapqpus are categories, and domdpus is in both, but that could be possible if categories overlap.\n\nPerhaps \"is\" here means \"is a\" or \"is part of\". But let's see the note: \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B. So, for example, if A is contained in B, then B contains A.\n\nAnother way to think: in set theory, \"A is B\" might mean A ⊆ B or A ∈ B? But from the note, it seems more like A ∈ B.\n\nLet's take an example from the given: \"fucspus is sikzpus\" so fucspus ∈ sikzpus.\n\n\"sikzpus is domdpus\" so sikzpus ∈ domdpus.\n\nThen \"domdpus is kiqzpus and wapqpus\" – this might mean that domdpus ∈ kiqzpus and domdpus ∈ wapqpus? Or does it mean that domdpus consists of kiqzpus and wapqpus? The word \"and\" suggests that domdpus is both kiqzpus and wapqpus, so perhaps domdpus is a member of both categories.\n\nBut then later: \"kiqzpus is pawwpus and liszpus\" which similarly might mean kiqzpus ∈ pawwpus and kiqzpus ∈ liszpus.\n\nAlso, \"pawwpus is jepspus\" so pawwpus ∈ jepspus.\n\n\"jepspus is babdpus and mupppus\" so jepspus ∈ babdpus and jepspus ∈ mupppus.\n\nAnd x is fucspus, so x ∈ fucspus.\n\nThe question is: is x is babdpus? meaning x ∈ babdpus?\n\nI need to trace the relationships from x to babdpus.\n\nx is fucspus, so x ∈ fucspus.\n\nfucspus is sikzpus, so fucspus ∈ sikzpus.\n\nsikzpus is domdpus, so sikzpus ∈ domdpus.\n\ndomdpus is kiqzpus and wapqpus, so domdpus ∈ kiqzpus and domdpus ∈ wapqpus.\n\nNow, kiqzpus is pawwpus and liszpus, so kiqzpus ∈ pawwpus and kiqzpus ∈ liszpus.\n\npawwpus is jepspus, so pawwpus ∈ jepspus.\n\njepspus is babdpus and mupppus, so jepspus ∈ babdpus and jepspus ∈ mupppus.\n\nI need to see if x is in babdpus. Since x is in fucspus, and fucspus is in sikzpus, sikzpus in domdpus, domdpus in kiqzpus, but kiqzpus is in pawwpus, pawwpus in jepspus, jepspus in babdpus.\n\nSo, if I have a chain of membership, but membership is not transitive in set theory. That is, if A ∈ B and B ∈ C, it does not necessarily mean that A ∈ C.\n\nFor example, if B is a set containing A, and C is a set containing B, A may not be in C unless C contains all elements of B, but not necessarily.\n\nIn this context, since we're dealing with categories, it might be that \"is\" implies a hierarchical relationship where membership is transitive? But the note doesn't say that.\n\nLet's read the note again: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'\"\n\nThe phrase \"A is contained in B\" might mean A ⊆ B, i.e., A is a subset of B, rather than an element.\n\nThat could change things.\n\nIn many logic puzzles, \"is\" can mean either \"is a member of\" or \"is a subset of\", but here the note specifies \"belongs to\" or \"contained in\", which are ambiguous.\n\n\"Belongs to\" typically means element of, while \"contained in\" might mean subset of.\n\nBut let's see the usage.\n\nIn the statement \"domdpus is kiqzpus and wapqpus\", if \"is\" means \"is contained in\", then domdpus ⊆ kiqzpus and domdpus ⊆ wapqpus? But that would mean that all elements of domdpus are in kiqzpus and in wapqpus, which might be possible.\n\nBut then \"kiqzpus is pawwpus and liszpus\" would mean kiqzpus ⊆ pawwpus and kiqzpus ⊆ liszpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"jepspus is babdpus and mupppus\" would mean jepspus ⊆ babdpus and jepspus ⊆ mupppus.\n\nBut if \"is\" means \"belongs to\", then it would be element of.\n\nThe note says \"or\", so it might be that in some cases it means belongs to, in others contained in, but that would be messy.\n\nPerhaps in this context, \"A is B\" means that A is a type of B, so B is a broader category, and A is a subclass or instance. So, in terms of sets, A ⊆ B, meaning A is a subset of B, so all A are B.\n\nThat seems more reasonable for such puzzles.\n\nLet me check with the first statement: \"fucspus is sikzpus\" – if fucspus is a type of sikzpus, then fucspus ⊆ sikzpus, meaning every fucspus is sikzpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"sikzpus is domdpus\" so sikzpus ⊆ domdpus, every sikzpus is domdpus.\n\nThen \"domdpus is kiqzpus and wapqpus\" – this might mean that domdpus is a type of kiqzpus and also a type of wapqpus, so domdpus ⊆ kiqzpus and domdpus ⊆ wapqpus.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nThen \"kiqzpus is pawwpus and liszpus\" so kiqzpus ⊆ pawwpus and kiqzpus ⊆ liszpus.\n\n\"pawwpus is jepspus\" so pawwpus ⊆ jepspus.\n\n\"jepspus is babdpus and mupppus\" so jepspus ⊆ babdpus and jepspus ⊆ mupppus.\n\nAlso, \"x is fucspus\" so x ⊆ fucspus?

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the relationships. The statement \"A is B\" means that A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, it's about hierarchical relationships or set membership.\n\nI have a list of such statements:\n\n- vevqpus is wekbpus.\n\n- femzpus is lerypus and camzpus.\n\n- divdpus is babcpus and resnpus.\n\n- x is vevqpus and sitrpus.\n\n- wegfpus is sutbpus.\n\n- pottpus is kuhvpus.\n\n- lerypus is wegfpus.\n\n- vevqpus is femzpus.\n\n- kuhvpus is babrpus and fucqpus.\n\n- pottpus is divdpus.\n\n- celwpus is pottpus.\n\n- celwpus is xetkpus.\n\n- sutbpus is celwpus.\n\n- lerypus is wesjpus.\n\nThe question is: Is x is babcpus and babrpus? Meaning, does x belong to both babcpus and babrpus?\n\nI need to trace the relationships from x to babcpus and babrpus.\n\nStart with x: x is vevqpus and sitrpus. So x belongs to vevqpus and sitrpus. But we care about babcpus and babrpus, so I need to see if vevqpus or sitrpus connect to those.\n\nFrom vevqpus: vevqpus is wekbpus. Also, vevqpus is femzpus. So vevqpus belongs to wekbpus and femzpus.\n\nNow, femzpus is lerypus and camzpus. So femzpus belongs to lerypus and camzpus.\n\nlerypus is wegfpus. And lerypus is wesjpus. But wegfpus is sutbpus. And sutbpus is celwpus. celwpus is pottpus and celwpus is xetkpus. pottpus is kuhvpus and pottpus is divdpus. kuhvpus is babrpus and fucqpus. divdpus is babcpus and resnpus.\n\nAlso, from vevqpus, it is wekbpus, but I don't see wekbpus connected to anything else yet. I need to focus on paths to babcpus and babrpus.\n\nSince we need babcpus and babrpus, let's see where they come from.\n\nbabrpus is from kuhvpus: kuhvpus is babrpus and fucqpus.\n\nbabcpus is from divdpus: divdpus is babcpus and resnpus.\n\nNow, how to connect x to kuhvpus or divdpus.\n\nx is vevqpus, and vevqpus is femzpus.\n\nfemzpus is lerypus and camzpus.\n\nlerypus is wegfpus.\n\nwegfpus is sutbpus.\n\nsutbpus is celwpus.\n\ncelwpus is pottpus.\n\npottpus is kuhvpus. and pottpus is divdpus.\n\nSo, from x -> vevqpus -> femzpus -> lerypus -> wegfpus -> sutbpus -> celwpus -> pottpus -> kuhvpus -> babrpus\n\nAnd also pottpus -> divdpus -> babcpus\n\nTherefore, x is connected to both babrpus and babcpus through this chain.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any other paths or if this is consistent.\n\nAlso, note that vevqpus is wekbpus, but wekbpus isn't connected to anything else, so that might not help directly.\n\nNow, the question is whether x is babcpus and babrpus. Since x belongs to vevqpus, and through the chain, vevqpus eventually leads to both babcpus and babrpus, so yes, x should belong to both.\n\nBut let's make sure about the directions. \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so B is a category that contains A. So if A is B and B is C, then A is C, meaning A belongs to C.\n\nIn this case, from x is vevqpus, and vevqpus is femzpus, so x is femzpus. Then femzpus is lerypus, so x is lerypus. And so on.\n\nSimilarly, lerypus is wegfpus, so x is wegfpus. wegfpus is sutbpus, so x is sutbpus. sutbpus is celwpus, so x is celwpus. celwpus is pottpus, so x is pottpus. pottpus is kuhvpus, so x is kuhvpus. kuhvpus is babrpus, so x is babrpus.\n\nAlso, pottpus is divdpus, so since x is pottpus, x is divdpus. And divdpus is babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is both babcpus and babrpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's check if there are any contradictions or missing links.\n\nWe also have lerypus is wesjpus, but that doesn't affect the path to babrpus or babcpus.\n\nSimilarly, vevqpus is wekbpus, but wekbpus isn't used.\n\nAlso, x is sitrpus, but sitrpus isn't connected to anything, so we can ignore it for this question.\n\nSo, no contradictions.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babcpus and babrpus.",

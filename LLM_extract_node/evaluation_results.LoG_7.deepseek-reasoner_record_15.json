      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

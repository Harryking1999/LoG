So if x is connected to giscpus, then x might be babmpus and babnpus.\n\nBut what about babbpus? We need babbpus as well.\n\nFrom above, we have giscpus is babmpus and babnpus, but not babbpus.\n\nNow, where is babbpus mentioned? From the list, I see \"yirfpus is babbpus and zewwpus and xogvpus.\"\n\nAnd yirfpus is from guqhpus: \"guqhpus is yirfpus.\"\n\nAnd guqhpus is from qichpus: \"qichpus is guqhpus.\"\n\nAnd qichpus is from xigjpus: \"xigjpus is qichpus and yosmpus.\"\n\nxigjpus is from leztpus: \"leztpus is xigjpus.\"\n\nleztpus is from kevkpus: \"kevkpus is leztpus.\"\n\nkevkpus is from lisgpus: \"lisgpus is kevkpus.\"\n\nlisgpus is from sokppus: \"sokppus is lisgpus and pizgpus.\"\n\nsokppus is from bahcpus: \"bahcpus is sokppus.\"\n\nAnd bahcpus is from xatypus, which we had earlier from the first path.\n\nBut we need to see if x is connected to yirfpus.\n\nSince x is tevgpus and herjpus, we need to see if either path leads to yirfpus.\n\nFrom the tevgpus path, we eventually reached giscpus, which is babmpus and babnpus, but not babbpus.\n\nFrom the herjpus path, we were going through a long chain, but let's see if it connects to yirfpus.\n\nAlternatively, from x is herjpus, herjpus is soddpus, soddpus is qodqpus, etc., but this might take time.\n\nSince we have giscpus from the tevgpus path, and giscpus has babmpus and babnpus, we need only babbpus.\n\nNow, from the herjpus path, we might get to babbpus.\n\nBut let's see if there's a shorter way.\n\nWe also have from the tevgpus path, we had monvpus, which is jozjpus and mildpus, but that doesn't seem to help for babbpus.\n\nAnother thing: from the list, we have \"retzpus is gixxpus\" and \"retzpus is zogcpus\", but retzpus is also from yinqpus, which is from xirrpus, which is from renfpus, which is from jafqpus, etc., from the herjpus path.\n\nBut let's list the herjpus path briefly.\n\nx is herjpus.\n\nherjpus is soddpus.\n\nsoddpus is qodqpus.\n\nqodqpus is saqrpus and zojbpus.\n\nsaqrpus is pedspus and rofrpus.\n\npedspus is qulkpus.\n\nqulkpus is jonypus.\n\njonypus is raltpus.\n\nraltpus is gilrpus.\n\ngilrpus is modwpus.\n\nmodwpus is bavdpus.\n\nbavdpus is kegypus.\n\nkegypus is famwpus and zuzqpus.\n\nfamwpus is valmpus and cushpus.\n\nvalmpus is yicppus.\n\nyicppus is lopwpus and sitmpus.\n\nlopwpus is juvdpus and watnpus.\n\njuvdpus is xatypus.\n\nxatypus is bahcpus and xuhxpus.\n\nbahcpus is batypus and also sokppus.\n\nbatypus is jemxpus.\n\njemxpus is hewmpus.\n\nhewmpus is tegrpus.\n\ntegrpus is jafqpus.\n\njafqpus is renfpus and wiqdpus.\n\nrenfpus is xirrpus and qusnpus.\n\nxirrpus is yinqpus and qowqpus.\n\nyinqpus is retzpus and kosbpus.\n\nretzpus is gixxpus and also zogcpus.\n\nNow, from retzpus, we have gixxpus, but what is gixxpus? It doesn't seem to connect to babbpus.\n\nFrom yinqpus, we have retzpus and kosbpus, but kosbpus isn't defined elsewhere that I see.\n\nThis path doesn't seem to lead to yirfpus or babbpus.\n\nBut from the tevgpus path, we have giscpus, which is babmpus and babnpus.\n\nNow for babbpus, we need yirfpus.\n\nHow can x be connected to yirfpus?\n\nFrom the tevgpus path, we have cakspus is giscpus, but giscpus doesn't have babbpus.\n\nyirfpus is from guqhpus, and guqhpus is from qichpus, and qichpus is from xigjpus, and xigjpus is from leztpus, and leztpus is from kevkpus, and kevkpus is from lisgpus, and lisgpus is from sokppus, and sokppus is from bahcpus.\n\nNow, bahcpus is from xatypus, which we have in the herjpus path. But in the herjpus path, we have xatypus from juvdpus, etc., but we need to see if x is connected to bahcpus.\n\nFrom herjpus path, we have xatypus, which is bahcpus, so if x is herjpus, then through the chain, x is bahcpus? But let's see.\n\nSince \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if herjpus is soddpus, and soddpus is qodqpus, etc., it means herjpus is contained in soddpus, so herjpus is a subset of soddpus, but for x, which is herjpus, it means x is an instance of herjpus, so x belongs to herjpus, and herjpus belongs to soddpus, so x belongs to soddpus, and so on.\n\nSo by transitivity, x belongs to all the categories in the chain.\n\nSimilarly for x is tevgpus.\n\nSo from x is herjpus, we can follow the chain to see what categories x belongs to.\n\nFrom the herjpus chain, we have bahcpus at the end? Let's see the chain.\n\nFrom above: herjpus is soddpus, so x is soddpus.\n\nsoddpus is qodqpus, so x is qodqpus.\n\nqodqpus is saqrpus and zojbpus, so x is saqrpus and x is zojbpus.\n\nsaqrpus is pedspus and rofrpus, so x is pedspus and x is rofrpus.\n\npedspus is qulkpus, so x is qulkpus.\n\nqulkpus is jonypus, so x is jonypus.\n\njonypus is raltpus, so x is raltpus.\n\nraltpus is gilrpus, so x is gilrpus.\n\ngilrpus is modwpus, so x is modwpus.\n\nmodwpus is bavdpus, so x is bavdpus.\n\nbavdpus is kegypus, so x is kegypus.\n\nkegypus is famwpus and zuzqpus, so x is famwpus and x is zuzqpus.\n\nfamwpus is valmpus and cushpus, so x is valmpus and x is cushpus.\n\nvalmpus is yicppus, so x is yicppus.\n\nyicppus is lopwpus and sitmpus, so x is lopwpus and x is sitmpus.\n\nlopwpus is juvdpus and watnpus, so x is juvdpus and x is watnpus.\n\njuvdpus is xatypus, so x is xatypus.\n\nxatypus is bahcpus and xuhxpus, so x is bahcpus and x is xuhxpus.\n\nSo from this chain, x is bahcpus.\n\nNow, bahcpus is sokppus (from \"bahcpus is sokppus\"), so x is sokppus.\n\nsokppus is lisgpus and pizgpus, so x is lisgpus and x is pizgpus.\n\nlisgpus is kevkpus (from \"lisgpus is kevkpus\"), so x is kevkpus.\n\nkevkpus is leztpus (from \"kevkpus is leztpus\"), so x is leztpus.\n\nleztpus is xigjpus (from \"leztpus is xigjpus\"), so x is xigjpus.\n\nxigjpus is qichpus and yosmpus (from \"xigjpus is qichpus and yosmpus\"), so x is qichpus and x is yosmpus.\n\nqichpus is guqhpus (from \"qichpus is guqhpus\"), so x is guqhpus.\n\nguqhpus is yirfpus (from \"guqhpus is yirfpus\"), so x is yirfpus.\n\nyirfpus is babbpus and zewwpus and xogvpus (from \"yirfpus is babbpus and zewwpus and xogvpus\"), so x is babbpus and x is zewwpus and x is xogvpus.\n\nTherefore, from the herjpus path, x is babbpus.\n\nNow, from the tevgpus path, we have x is tevgpus.\n\ntevgpus is zuffpus and zagwpus, so x is zuffpus and x is zagwpus.\n\nzuffpus is meyypus, so x is meyypus.\n\nmeyypus is tigfpus and balgpus, so x is tigfpus and x is balgpus.\n\ntigfpus is cawzpus, so x is cawzpus.\n\ncawzpus is ribwpus and subkpus, so x is ribwpus and x is subkpus.\n\nribwpus is suycpus, so x is suycpus.\n\nsuycpus is cubgpus, so x is cubgpus.\n\ncubgpus is kilfpus, so x is kilfpus.\n\nkilfpus is vayspus and bowbpus, so x is vayspus and x is bowbpus.\n\nvayspus is fagzpus, so x is fagzpus.\n\nfagzpus is pezjpus, so x is pezjpus.\n\npezjpus is ratspus, so x is ratspus. (also pezjpus is poccpus, so x is poccpus)\n\nratspus is tamdpus and riffpus, so x is tamdpus and x is riffpus.\n\ntamdpus is duvtpus, so x is duvtpus.\n\nduvtpus is capgpus and kikwpus and famppus, so x is capgpus and x is kikwpus and x is famppus.\n\ncapgpus is ribjpus, so x is ribjpus.\n\nribjpus is rovppus and rebqpus, so x is rovppus and x is rebqpus.\n\nrovppus is rivkpus and sapgpus, so x is rivkpus and x is sapgpus. (also rovppus is nubwpus and tevfpus, but since rovppus is multiple, x is all of them? From \"rovppus is nubwpus and tevfpus\" and \"rovppus is rivkpus and sapgpus\", it means rovppus consists of these, so x belongs to rovppus, so x belongs to all these categories? But since \"is\" means belongs to or contained in, it might be that rovppus is a category that contains nubwpus, tevfpus, rivkpus, sapgpus, so if x is rovppus, then x is in that category, but not necessarily in each subcategory? No, from the meaning, if A is B, it means A is a subset of B or A is an instance of B, but in this context, it seems that \"A is B\" means that A is a type of B or A is contained in B, so if rovppus is nubwpus, it means that the category rovppus is contained in nubwpus? That doesn't make sense. Let's read the note.\n\nThe note says: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\"\n\nSo, for example, \"raltpus is feftpus\" means that raltpus belongs to category feftpus, so feftpus is a broader category that includes raltpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"rovppus is nubwpus and tevfpus\" means that rovppus belongs to nubwpus and also belongs to tevfpus? But that would mean rovppus is in multiple categories, which is fine.\n\nBut in terms of instances, if x is rovppus, then since rovppus belongs to nubwpus, then x also belongs to nubwpus? Yes, by transitivity.\n\nIf x is a member of rovppus, and rovppus is contained in nubwpus, then x is contained in nubwpus.\n\nSo similarly, from the statements, we can chain the belonging.\n\nSo back to the chain.\n\nx is rovppus, and rovppus is nubwpus and tevfpus, so x is nubwpus and x is tevfpus.\n\nAlso rovppus is rivkpus and sapgpus, so x is rivkpus and x is sapgpus.\n\nNow, from above, rivkpus is cexlpus and vattpus, so x is cexlpus and x is vattpus.\n\ncexlpus is monvpus, so x is monvpus. (also cexlpus is waqqpus, so x is waqqpus)\n\nmonvpus is jozjpus and mildpus, so x is jozjpus and x is mildpus.\n\njozjpus is momjpus, so x is momjpus.\n\nmomjpus is nicwpus and dovbpus, so x is nicwpus and x is dovbpus.\n\nnicwpus is tayrpus, so x is tayrpus.\n\ntayrpus is soykpus and womvpus, so x is soykpus and x is womvpus.\n\nsoykpus is jurbpus and jaxcpus, so x is jurbpus and x is jaxcpus.\n\njurbpus is winppus, so x is winppus.\n\nwinppus is vudwpus and midvpus, so x is vudwpus and x is midvpus.\n\nvudwpus is zozkpus, so x is zozkpus.\n\nzozkpus is vojxpus, so x is vojxpus.\n\nvojxpus is yamxpus, so x is yamxpus.\n\nyamxpus is cafvpus, so x is cafvpus.\n\ncafvpus is cakspus, so x is cakspus.\n\ncakspus is giscpus, so x is giscpus.\n\nNow, giscpus is babmpus and babnpus and zafspus and cuzwpus (from \"giscpus is babmpus and babnpus and zafspus and cuzwpus\"), so x is babmpus and x is babnpus and x is zafspus and x is cuzwpus.\n\nTherefore, from the tevgpus path, x is babmpus and babnpus.\n\nAnd from the herjpus path, we already have x is babbpus.\n\nSo, overall, x is babbpus (from herjpus) and babmpus and babnpus (from tevgpus).\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babbpus and babmpus and babnpus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any conflict or missing link.\n\nWe have two paths for x: x is herjpus and x is tevgpus, and both lead to the required categories.\n\nThus, the statement is true.",

So if x is connected to giscpus, then x might be babmpus and babnpus.\n\nBut what about babbpus? We need babbpus as well.\n\nFrom above, we have giscpus is babmpus and babnpus, but not babbpus.\n\nNow, where is babbpus mentioned? From the list, I see \"yirfpus is babbpus and zewwpus and xogvpus.\"\n\nAnd yirfpus is from guqhpus: \"guqhpus is yirfpus.\"\n\nAnd guqhpus is from qichpus: \"qichpus is guqhpus.\"\n\nAnd qichpus is from xigjpus: \"xigjpus is qichpus and yosmpus.\"\n\nxigjpus is from leztpus: \"leztpus is xigjpus.\"\n\nleztpus is from kevkpus: \"kevkpus is leztpus.\"\n\nkevkpus is from lisgpus: \"lisgpus is kevkpus.\"\n\nlisgpus is from sokppus: \"sokppus is lisgpus and pizgpus.\"\n\nsokppus is from bahcpus: \"bahcpus is sokppus.\"\n\nAnd bahcpus is from xatypus, which we had earlier from the first path.\n\nBut we need to see if x is connected to yirfpus.\n\nSince x is tevgpus and herjpus, we need to see if either path leads to yirfpus.\n\nFrom the tevgpus path, we eventually reached giscpus, which is babmpus and babnpus, but not babbpus.\n\nFrom the herjpus path, we were going through a long chain, but let's see if it connects to yirfpus.\n\nAlternatively, from x is herjpus, herjpus is soddpus, soddpus is qodqpus, etc., but this might take time.\n\nSince we have giscpus from the tevgpus path, and giscpus has babmpus and babnpus, we need only babbpus.\n\nNow, from the herjpus path, we might get to babbpus.\n\nBut let's see if there's a shorter way.\n\nWe also have from the tevgpus path, we had monvpus, which is jozjpus and mildpus, but that doesn't seem to help for babbpus.\n\nAnother thing: from the list, we have \"retzpus is gixxpus\" and \"retzpus is zogcpus\", but retzpus is also from yinqpus, which is from xirrpus, which is from renfpus, which is from jafqpus, etc., from the herjpus path.\n\nBut let's list the herjpus path briefly.\n\nx is herjpus.\n\nherjpus is soddpus.\n\nsoddpus is qodqpus.\n\nqodqpus is saqrpus and zojbpus.\n\nsaqrpus is pedspus and rofrpus.\n\npedspus is qulkpus.\n\nqulkpus is jonypus.\n\njonypus is raltpus.\n\nraltpus is gilrpus.\n\ngilrpus is modwpus.\n\nmodwpus is bavdpus.\n\nbavdpus is kegypus.\n\nkegypus is famwpus and zuzqpus.\n\nfamwpus is valmpus and cushpus.\n\nvalmpus is yicppus.\n\nyicppus is lopwpus and sitmpus.\n\nlopwpus is juvdpus and watnpus.\n\njuvdpus is xatypus.\n\nxatypus is bahcpus and xuhxpus.\n\nbahcpus is batypus and also sokppus.\n\nbatypus is jemxpus.\n\njemxpus is hewmpus.\n\nhewmpus is tegrpus.\n\ntegrpus is jafqpus.\n\njafqpus is renfpus and wiqdpus.\n\nrenfpus is xirrpus and qusnpus.\n\nxirrpus is yinqpus and qowqpus.\n\nyinqpus is retzpus and kosbpus.\n\nretzpus is gixxpus and also zogcpus.\n\nNow, from retzpus, we have gixxpus, but what is gixxpus? It doesn't seem to connect to babbpus.\n\nFrom yinqpus, we have retzpus and kosbpus, but kosbpus isn't defined elsewhere that I see.\n\nThis path doesn't seem to lead to yirfpus or babbpus.\n\nBut from the tevgpus path, we have giscpus, which is babmpus and babnpus.\n\nNow for babbpus, we need yirfpus.\n\nHow can x be connected to yirfpus?\n\nFrom the tevgpus path, we have cakspus is giscpus, but giscpus doesn't have babbpus.\n\nyirfpus is from guqhpus, and guqhpus is from qichpus, and qichpus is from xigjpus, and xigjpus is from leztpus, and leztpus is from kevkpus, and kevkpus is from lisgpus, and lisgpus is from sokppus, and sokppus is from bahcpus.\n\nNow, bahcpus is from xatypus, which we have in the herjpus path. But in the herjpus path, we have xatypus from juvdpus, etc., but we need to see if x is connected to bahcpus.\n\nFrom herjpus path, we have xatypus, which is bahcpus, so if x is herjpus, then through the chain, x is bahcpus? But let's see.\n\nSince \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if herjpus is soddpus, and soddpus is qodqpus, etc., it means herjpus is contained in soddpus, so herjpus is a subset of soddpus, but for x, which is herjpus, it means x is an instance of herjpus, so x belongs to herjpus, and herjpus belongs to soddpus, so x belongs to soddpus, and so on.\n\nSo by transitivity, x belongs to all the categories in the chain.\n\nSimilarly for x is tevgpus.\n\nSo from x is herjpus, we can follow the chain to see what categories x belongs to.\n\nFrom the herjpus chain, we have bahcpus at the end? Let's see the chain.\n\nFrom above: herjpus is soddpus, so x is soddpus.\n\nsoddpus is qodqpus, so x is qodqpus.\n\nqodqpus is saqrpus and zojbpus, so x is saqrpus and x is zojbpus.\n\nsaqrpus is pedspus and rofrpus, so x is pedspus and x is rofrpus.\n\npedspus is qulkpus, so x is qulkpus.\n\nqulkpus is jonypus, so x is jonypus.\n\njonypus is raltpus, so x is raltpus.\n\nraltpus is gilrpus, so x is gilrpus.\n\ngilrpus is modwpus, so x is modwpus.\n\nmodwpus is bavdpus, so x is bavdpus.\n\nbavdpus is kegypus, so x is kegypus.\n\nkegypus is famwpus and zuzqpus, so x is famwpus and x is zuzqpus.\n\nfamwpus is valmpus and cushpus, so x is valmpus and x is cushpus.\n\nvalmpus is yicppus, so x is yicppus.\n\nyicppus is lopwpus and sitmpus, so x is lopwpus and x is sitmpus.\n\nlopwpus is juvdpus and watnpus, so x is juvdpus and x is watnpus.\n\njuvdpus is xatypus, so x is xatypus.\n\nxatypus is bahcpus and xuhxpus, so x is bahcpus and x is xuhxpus.\n\nSo from this chain, x is bahcpus.\n\nNow, bahcpus is sokppus (from \"bahcpus is sokppus\"), so x is sokppus.\n\nsokppus is lisgpus and pizgpus, so x is lisgpus and x is pizgpus.\n\nlisgpus is kevkpus (from \"lisgpus is kevkpus\"), so x is kevkpus.\n\nkevkpus is leztpus (from \"kevkpus is leztpus\"), so x is leztpus.\n\nleztpus is xigjpus (from \"leztpus is xigjpus\"), so x is xigjpus.\n\nxigjpus is qichpus and yosmpus (from \"xigjpus is qichpus and yosmpus\"), so x is qichpus and x is yosmpus.\n\nqichpus is guqhpus (from \"qichpus is guqhpus\"), so x is guqhpus.\n\nguqhpus is yirfpus (from \"guqhpus is yirfpus\"), so x is yirfpus.\n\nyirfpus is babbpus and zewwpus and xogvpus (from \"yirfpus is babbpus and zewwpus and xogvpus\"), so x is babbpus and x is zewwpus and x is xogvpus.\n\nTherefore, from the herjpus path, x is babbpus.\n\nNow, from the tevgpus path, we have x is tevgpus.\n\ntevgpus is zuffpus and zagwpus, so x is zuffpus and x is zagwpus.\n\nzuffpus is meyypus, so x is meyypus.\n\nmeyypus is tigfpus and balgpus, so x is tigfpus and x is balgpus.\n\ntigfpus is cawzpus, so x is cawzpus.\n\ncawzpus is ribwpus and subkpus, so x is ribwpus and x is subkpus.\n\nribwpus is suycpus, so x is suycpus.\n\nsuycpus is cubgpus, so x is cubgpus.\n\ncubgpus is kilfpus, so x is kilfpus.\n\nkilfpus is vayspus and bowbpus, so x is vayspus and x is bowbpus.\n\nvayspus is fagzpus, so x is fagzpus.\n\nfagzpus is pezjpus, so x is pezjpus.\n\npezjpus is ratspus, so x is ratspus. (also pezjpus is poccpus, so x is poccpus)\n\nratspus is tamdpus and riffpus, so x is tamdpus and x is riffpus.\n\ntamdpus is duvtpus, so x is duvtpus.\n\nduvtpus is capgpus and kikwpus and famppus, so x is capgpus and x is kikwpus and x is famppus.\n\ncapgpus is ribjpus, so x is ribjpus.\n\nribjpus is rovppus and rebqpus, so x is rovppus and x is rebqpus.\n\nrovppus is rivkpus and sapgpus, so x is rivkpus and x is sapgpus. (also rovppus is nubwpus and tevfpus, but since rovppus is multiple, x is all of them? From \"rovppus is nubwpus and tevfpus\" and \"rovppus is rivkpus and sapgpus\", it means rovppus consists of these, so x belongs to rovppus, so x belongs to all these categories? But since \"is\" means belongs to or contained in, it might be that rovppus is a category that contains nubwpus, tevfpus, rivkpus, sapgpus, so if x is rovppus, then x is in that category, but not necessarily in each subcategory? No, from the meaning, if A is B, it means A is a subset of B or A is an instance of B, but in this context, it seems that \"A is B\" means that A is a type of B or A is contained in B, so if rovppus is nubwpus, it means that the category rovppus is contained in nubwpus? That doesn't make sense. Let's read the note.\n\nThe note says: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\"\n\nSo, for example, \"raltpus is feftpus\" means that raltpus belongs to category feftpus, so feftpus is a broader category that includes raltpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"rovppus is nubwpus and tevfpus\" means that rovppus belongs to nubwpus and also belongs to tevfpus? But that would mean rovppus is in multiple categories, which is fine.\n\nBut in terms of instances, if x is rovppus, then since rovppus belongs to nubwpus, then x also belongs to nubwpus? Yes, by transitivity.\n\nIf x is a member of rovppus, and rovppus is contained in nubwpus, then x is contained in nubwpus.\n\nSo similarly, from the statements, we can chain the belonging.\n\nSo back to the chain.\n\nx is rovppus, and rovppus is nubwpus and tevfpus, so x is nubwpus and x is tevfpus.\n\nAlso rovppus is rivkpus and sapgpus, so x is rivkpus and x is sapgpus.\n\nNow, from above, rivkpus is cexlpus and vattpus, so x is cexlpus and x is vattpus.\n\ncexlpus is monvpus, so x is monvpus. (also cexlpus is waqqpus, so x is waqqpus)\n\nmonvpus is jozjpus and mildpus, so x is jozjpus and x is mildpus.\n\njozjpus is momjpus, so x is momjpus.\n\nmomjpus is nicwpus and dovbpus, so x is nicwpus and x is dovbpus.\n\nnicwpus is tayrpus, so x is tayrpus.\n\ntayrpus is soykpus and womvpus, so x is soykpus and x is womvpus.\n\nsoykpus is jurbpus and jaxcpus, so x is jurbpus and x is jaxcpus.\n\njurbpus is winppus, so x is winppus.\n\nwinppus is vudwpus and midvpus, so x is vudwpus and x is midvpus.\n\nvudwpus is zozkpus, so x is zozkpus.\n\nzozkpus is vojxpus, so x is vojxpus.\n\nvojxpus is yamxpus, so x is yamxpus.\n\nyamxpus is cafvpus, so x is cafvpus.\n\ncafvpus is cakspus, so x is cakspus.\n\ncakspus is giscpus, so x is giscpus.\n\nNow, giscpus is babmpus and babnpus and zafspus and cuzwpus (from \"giscpus is babmpus and babnpus and zafspus and cuzwpus\"), so x is babmpus and x is babnpus and x is zafspus and x is cuzwpus.\n\nTherefore, from the tevgpus path, x is babmpus and babnpus.\n\nAnd from the herjpus path, we already have x is babbpus.\n\nSo, overall, x is babbpus (from herjpus) and babmpus and babnpus (from tevgpus).\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babbpus and babmpus and babnpus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any conflict or missing link.\n\nWe have two paths for x: x is herjpus and x is tevgpus, and both lead to the required categories.\n\nThus, the statement is true.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nThus, the statement is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

Since x is cefypus, I'll start from cefypus.\n\nFrom the statements:\n\ncefypus is hajcpus.\n\nhajcpus is muxdpus.\n\nmuxdpus is pedqpus.\n\nSo, cefypus → hajcpus → muxdpus → pedqpus.\n\nNow, pedqpus is fackpus.\n\nSo, pedqpus → fackpus.\n\nfackpus is ducypus and lonppus.\n\nSo, fackpus → ducypus and fackpus → lonppus.\n\nducypus is puctpus and sibrpus.\n\nSo, ducypus → puctpus and ducypus → sibrpus.\n\nBut we also have puctpus is deqspus.\n\nAnd deqspus is babrpus and surypus.\n\nSo, deqspus → babrpus and deqspus → surypus.\n\nNow, since x is cefypus, and we have a chain from cefypus to deqspus through several steps.\n\nLet me map out the chain for x to babrpus.\n\nx is cefypus.\n\ncefypus is hajcpus.\n\nhajcpus is muxdpus.\n\nmuxdpus is pedqpus.\n\npedqpus is fackpus.\n\nfackpus is ducypus.\n\nducypus is puctpus.\n\npuctpus is deqspus.\n\ndeqspus is babrpus.\n\nSo, through this chain, x is connected to babrpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babrpus.\n\nThe question is: Is it true or false or unknown that x is babcpus or babrpus?\n\nSince x is babrpus, it is true that x is babrpus, so the OR condition is true because one of them is true.\n\nBut what about babcpus? I don't see any mention of babcpus in the given information. The only categories mentioned are: puctpus, deqspus, cefypus, hajcpus, pedqpus, fackpus, babrpus, surypus, muxdpus, ducypus, lonppus, sibrpus. No babcpus.\n\nSo, for babcpus, there is no information linking x to babcpus. Therefore, x is not babcpus, but since x is babrpus, the OR statement \"x is babcpus or babrpus\" is true because babrpus is true.\n\nThe question is: x is babcpus or babrpus? Since babrpus is true, the OR is true.\n\nI should confirm if there is any path to babcpus. From the given information, babcpus is not mentioned at all, so we can assume that x is not babcpus, but that doesn't matter because OR only requires one to be true.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babcpus or babrpus.\n\nBut let me double-check the chain to ensure that x is indeed babrpus.\n\nFrom above:\n\nx = cefypus\n\ncefypus is hajcpus → so x is hajcpus\n\nhajcpus is muxdpus → so x is muxdpus\n\nmuxdpus is pedqpus → so x is pedqpus\n\npedqpus is fackpus → so x is fackpus\n\nfackpus is ducypus → so x is ducypus (since fackpus is ducypus, meaning fackpus belongs to ducypus, so x belongs to ducypus)\n\nducypus is puctpus → so x is puctpus? Let's see: ducypus is puctpus, meaning ducypus belongs to puctpus. So if x is ducypus, and ducypus belongs to puctpus, then x belongs to puctpus.\n\nSimilarly, puctpus is deqspus → so x belongs to deqspus.\n\ndeqspus is babrpus → so x belongs to babrpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babrpus.\n\nYes, so x is babrpus.\n\nThus, for the OR condition, since babrpus is true, it is true.\n\nThe question says \"babcpus or babrpus\". Since babcpus is not mentioned, we don't know if x is babcpus, but we don't need to know because babrpus is true.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me make sure there is no trick. The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so it's a hierarchical relationship. So, from the chain, x is contained in babrpus.\n\nAlso, in the statements, deqspus is babrpus and surypus, meaning deqspus is contained in both, so from deqspus, we have babrpus.\n\nAnd we reached deqspus from x.\n\nSo, I think it's correct.",

For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, I think it's correct.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

Wait, no: from the information, \"fahtpus is locxpus and lidjpus\" and later \"fahtpus is hokhpus\"? Let me check.\n\nActually, from the given: \"fahtpus is locxpus and lidjpus.\" and then later \"majmpus is fahtpus and yizppus.\" and also \"fahtpus is hokhpus\" – I think I missed that. Let's see the full information.\n\nLooking back: \"fahtpus is locxpus and lidjpus.\" and then \"fahtpus is hokhpus.\"? No, in the list, it says: \"fahtpus is locxpus and lidjpus.\" and then later \"fahtpus is hokhpus.\" but that might be a mistake? Let's read carefully.\n\nThe given information has: \"fahtpus is locxpus and lidjpus.\" and then later \"majmpus is fahtpus and yizppus.\" and then after that, \"fahtpus is hokhpus.\"? No, from the text: \"fahtpus is locxpus and lidjpus. yufvpus is jujtpus. kaplpus is dotgpus. zenypus is visrpus. visrpus is foyzpus and gipcpus. locxpus is jegdpus. sujcpus is juwqpus and xinmpus. hokhpus is vudgpus and kogjpus. vudgpus is damgpus. soxgpus is doxmpus. bekgpus is vujrpus. gofrpus is kaplpus and xezdpus. tuvkpus is nihbpus and toncpus. jerqpus is lutjpus. totvpus is detbpus. keyjpus is voqcpus. damgpus is newkpus and pitypus. zuhmpus is powzpus. wetwpus is zuhmpus. cicjpus is qowfpus and zaswpus. yawmpus is sacvpus. duhdpus is kudcpus and binwpus. x is tuvkpus. sokzpus is babcpus and hozlpus and vidcpus. kudcpus is janlpus. voqcpus is romspus and noxppus. sacvpus is cirqpus. huqfpus is fukrpus and sisxpus. lutjpus is gegjpus and hostpus. jegdpus is kolspus. suqppus is laxqpus. powzpus is sokzpus. rovcpus is gofrpus. gegjpus is hakspus and fapgpus. majmpus is fahtpus and yizppus. fimwpus is soxgpus. fukrpus is comppus and zofzpus. laxqpus is zenypus and bojkpus. kaplpus is wetwpus. kolspus is keyjpus. fimwpus is gacfpus. nihbpus is cicjpus. vujrpus is totvpus and mohfpus. qowfpus is suqppus. doxmpus is xowmpus. jeklpus is jerqpus and tunppus. comppus is jeklpus. fahtpus is hokhpus. detbpus is huqfpus. xowmpus is majmpus. janlpus is fimwpus. cirqpus is gewypus and fejtpus. romspus is bekgpus. foyzpus is sujcpus. foyzpus is yawmpus. juwqpus is duhdpus.\"\n\nSo, indeed, there is \"fahtpus is hokhpus\" towards the end. So fahtpus is both locxpus and lidjpus, and also hokhpus? But in the context, \"is\" means belongs to category, so fahtpus belongs to multiple categories? That might be possible.\n\nBut for my path, I have x from foyzpus to sujcpus to juwqpus to duhdpus to kudcpus to janlpus to fimwpus to soxgpus to doxmpus to xowmpus to majmpus to fahtpus.\n\nAnd fahtpus is hokhpus? But I need to get to babcpus.\n\nbabcpus is under sokzpus, and sokzpus is under powzpus, etc.\n\nBut from fahtpus, what is it? fahtpus is also locxpus and lidjpus, but locxpus is jegdpus, and jegdpus is kolspus, and kolspus is keyjpus, and keyjpus is voqcpus, and voqcpus is romspus and noxppus, and romspus is bekgpus, and bekgpus is vujrpus, and vujrpus is totvpus and mohfpus, and totvpus is detbpus, and detbpus is huqfpus, and huqfpus is fukrpus and sisxpus, and fukrpus is comppus and zofzpus, and comppus is jeklpus, and jeklpus is jerqpus and tunppus, and jerqpus is lutjpus, and lutjpus is gegjpus and hostpus, and gegjpus is rovcpus, and rovcpus is gofrpus, and gofrpus is kaplpus and xezdpus, and kaplpus is wetwpus, and wetwpus is zuhmpus, and zuhmpus is powzpus, and powzpus is sokzpus, and sokzpus is babcpus and hozlpus and vidcpus.\n\nSo, indeed, through this long chain, fahtpus eventually leads to sokzpus and thus to babcpus.\n\nBut in my case, I have x which is fahtpus through the chain? Let's see if x is fahtpus.\n\nFrom above: x is foyzpus (from visrpus, etc.), foyzpus is sujcpus, sujcpus is juwqpus, juwqpus is duhdpus, duhdpus is kudcpus, kudcpus is janlpus, janlpus is fimwpus, fimwpus is soxgpus, soxgpus is doxmpus, doxmpus is xowmpus, xowmpus is majmpus, majmpus is fahtpus and yizppus. So yes, x is majmpus, and majmpus is fahtpus, so x is fahtpus.\n\nTherefore, x is fahtpus.\n\nNow, from fahtpus, we have fahtpus is hokhpus? But also, from the chain, fahtpus leads to other things.\n\nBut specifically, to get to babcpus, from fahtpus, since fahtpus is hokhpus? Let's see the chain from fahtpus to babcpus.\n\nFrom the information: fahtpus is hokhpus. (from \"fahtpus is hokhpus.\")\n\nThen hokhpus is vudgpus and kogjpus.\n\nvudgpus is damgpus.\n\ndamgpus is newkpus and pitypus.\n\nBut that doesn't lead to sokzpus. Alternatively, from fahtpus, we have other paths.\n\nBut from the long chain I thought earlier, it was through locxpus and so on, but let's confirm.\n\nActually, from fahtpus, we have fahtpus is locxpus and lidjpus. But locxpus is jegdpus, jegdpus is kolspus, kolspus is keyjpus, keyjpus is voqcpus, voqcpus is romspus and noxppus, romspus is bekgpus, bekgpus is vujrpus, vujrpus is totvpus and mohfpus, totvpus is detbpus, detbpus is huqfpus, huqfpus is fukrpus and sisxpus, fukrpus is comppus and zofzpus, comppus is jeklpus, jeklpus is jerqpus and tunppus, jerqpus is lutjpus, lutjpus is gegjpus and hostpus, gegjpus is rovcpus, rovcpus is gofrpus, gofrpus is kaplpus and xezdpus, kaplpus is wetwpus, wetwpus is zuhmpus, zuhmpus is powzpus, powzpus is sokzpus, sokzpus is babcpus.\n\nSo, through locxpus, fahtpus leads to babcpus.\n\nSince x is fahtpus, x is locxpus, and thus through the chain, x is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus.\n\nThe question is whether x is babbpus or babcpus. Since x is babcpus, it is true that x is babcpus.\n\nBut is there babbpus? The question mentions \"babbpus or babcpus\". From the information, sokzpus is babcpus and hozlpus and vidcpus, so babcpus is mentioned, but babbpus is not mentioned anywhere in the given information. So, babbpus is unknown or not present.\n\nTherefore, since x is babcpus, it is true that x is babcpus, so the statement \"x is babbpus or babcpus\" is true because one of the disjuncts is true.\n\nThe question is: \"Is it true or false or unknown: x is babbpus or babcpus?\"\n\nSince x is babcpus, it is true that x is babcpus, so the OR statement is true.\n\nThus, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check if x is indeed babcpus.\n\nI have two paths: one from x to fahtpus, and then from fahtpus to babcpus.\n\nFrom x to fahtpus: x is tuvkpus, tuvkpus is nihbpus, nihbpus is cicjpus, cicjpus is qowfpus, qowfpus is suqppus, suqppus is laxqpus, laxqpus is zenypus, zenypus is visrpus, visrpus is foyzpus, foyzpus is sujcpus, sujcpus is juwqpus, juwqpus is duhdpus, duhdpus is kudcpus, kudcpus is janlpus, janlpus is fimwpus, fimwpus is soxgpus, soxgpus is doxmpus, doxmpus is xowmpus, xowmpus is majmpus, majmpus is fahtpus. So yes, x is fahtpus.\n\nNow, from fahtpus to babcpus: fahtpus is locxpus (since fahtpus is locxpus and lidjpus). locxpus is jegdpus. jegdpus is kolspus. kolspus is keyjpus. keyjpus is voqcpus. voqcpus is romspus. romspus is bekgpus. bekgpus is vujrpus. vujrpus is totvpus. totvpus is detbpus. detbpus is huqfpus. huqfpus is fukrpus. fukrpus is comppus. comppus is jeklpus. jeklpus is jerqpus. jerqpus is lutjpus. lutjpus is gegjpus. gegjpus is rovcpus. rovcpus is gofrpus. gofrpus is kaplpus. kaplpus is wetwpus. wetwpus is zuhmpus. zuhmpus is powzpus. powzpus is sokzpus. sokzpus is babcpus. So, since fahtpus is locxpus, and locxpus is jegdpus, etc., eventually fahtpus is sokzpus, and thus babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus.\n\nSo, for the question, x is babcpus, so \"x is babbpus or babcpus\" is true.\n\nNote that babbpus is not mentioned, so we don't know if x is babbpus, but since x is babcpus, the OR is true.\n\nThus, the answer is true.",

So yes, x is fahtpus.\n\nNow, from fahtpus to babcpus: fahtpus is locxpus (since fahtpus is locxpus and lidjpus). locxpus is jegdpus. jegdpus is kolspus. kolspus is keyjpus. keyjpus is voqcpus. voqcpus is romspus. romspus is bekgpus. bekgpus is vujrpus. vujrpus is totvpus. totvpus is detbpus. detbpus is huqfpus. huqfpus is fukrpus. fukrpus is comppus. comppus is jeklpus. jeklpus is jerqpus. jerqpus is lutjpus. lutjpus is gegjpus. gegjpus is rovcpus. rovcpus is gofrpus. gofrpus is kaplpus. kaplpus is wetwpus. wetwpus is zuhmpus. zuhmpus is powzpus. powzpus is sokzpus. sokzpus is babcpus. So, since fahtpus is locxpus, and locxpus is jegdpus, etc., eventually fahtpus is sokzpus, and thus babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus.\n\nSo, for the question, x is babcpus, so \"x is babbpus or babcpus\" is true.\n\nNote that babbpus is not mentioned, so we don't know if x is babbpus, but since x is babcpus, the OR is true.\n\nThus, the answer is true.",

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nThus, the answer is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

From the given: vuffpus is hobmpus. Actually, looking back: \"vuffpus is hotfpus and dimkpus.\" and then \"vuffpus is hobmpus.\" So, vuffpus is hobmpus, and hobmpus is babcpus. So, vuffpus is babcpus.\n\nBut is x connected to vuffpus? x is currently xiylpus and pukmpus.\n\nxiylpus is zenmpus and cexdpus. So, x is zenmpus and cexdpus.\n\nzenmpus is qiytpus. So, x is qiytpus.\n\nqiytpus is yuctpus. So, x is yuctpus.\n\nyuctpus is daclpus. So, x is daclpus.\n\ndaclpus is zohcpus. So, x is zohcpus.\n\nzohcpus is ragypus. So, x is ragypus.\n\nragypus is nulqpus and rimtpus and binmpus. So, x is nulqpus.\n\nnulqpus is jewmpus and yotspus. Also, nulqpus is ciblpus? From given: \"nulqpus is ciblpus.\" So, x is ciblpus? Since x is nulqpus, and nulqpus is ciblpus, so x is ciblpus.\n\nBut ciblpus is hitnpus and capcpus. So, x is hitnpus.\n\nhitnpus is hiyrpus. So, x is hiyrpus.\n\nhiyrpus is qupkpus. So, x is qupkpus.\n\nqupkpus is kexhpus and buhqpus. So, x is kexhpus.\n\nkexhpus is joqkpus. So, x is joqkpus.\n\njoqkpus is varxpus and nelppus. So, x is varxpus.\n\nvarxpus is fodkpus. So, x is fodkpus.\n\nfodkpus is lojfpus. So, x is lojfpus.\n\nlojfpus is fevhpus. Also, lojfpus is boccpus and qolmpus. But I need babbpus and babcpus.\n\nNow, from lojfpus, which is fevhpus, and fevhpus is qexzpus and rijxpus.\n\nBut I think I'm getting away from babbpus. I need to connect to jibppus since jibppus is babbpus.\n\nAlso, for babcpus, I have vuffpus is babcpus, but I need to see if x is vuffpus.\n\nFrom above, x is lojfpus. But is lojfpus connected to vuffpus? Let's see.\n\nI have yektpus is vuffpus and laclpus. But yektpus is hexbpus? hexbpus is yektpus. So hexbpus is yektpus, so hexbpus is vuffpus and laclpus.\n\nBut x is lojfpus. How is lojfpus related to vuffpus?\n\nPerhaps I should look for another path.\n\nI also have x from another branch? x is also pukmpus from faqrpus, but I didn't explore that yet.\n\nFrom faqrpus, x is xiylpus and pukmpus. I went through xiylpus to zenmpus, etc., and ended up with x being lojfpus. But let's see if pukmpus leads anywhere.\n\npukmpus isn't directly defined in the given information. I need to see if pukmpus is mentioned elsewhere.\n\nLooking through the given, I don't see any other mention of pukmpus. So, from pukmpus, I might not get more information. So, the path through xiylpus seems to be the only one for x.\n\nBut from x, I have x is lojfpus. Now, I need to see if lojfpus is babbpus or connected to babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is part of jibppus: jibppus is babbpus and tixdpus.\n\nSo, is lojfpus connected to jibppus?\n\nlojfpus is fevhpus, and fevhpus is qexzpus and rijxpus.\n\nqexzpus is genvpus and wivspus.\n\ngenvpus is jayxpus.\n\njayxpus is xafrpus and lirfpus and furypus.\n\nxafrpus is mixnpus.\n\nmixnpus is labjpus.\n\nlabjpus is vilwpus and rekwpus.\n\nvilwpus is xudppus.\n\nxudppus is vuqjpus and qedjpus.\n\nvuqjpus is jufcpus and jazgpus.\n\njufcpus is fohvpus and jibvpus.\n\nfohvpus is yubkpus and cozmpus.\n\nyubkpus is yapypus and kitwpus.\n\nyapypus is wazxpus and also yapypus is tumypus? From given: \"yapypus is wazxpus\" and \"yapypus is tumypus\"? No, let's see: \"yapypus is wazxpus\" and then later \"yapypus is tumypus\"? Actually, from given: \"yapypus is wazxpus\" and then \"yapypus is tumypus\" is not stated. I think I misread.\n\nFrom the given: \"yapypus is wazxpus\" and then \"yapypus is tumypus\" is not there. Instead, we have \"tumypus is siqxpus\" and \"siqxpus is zoqgpus\" etc.\n\nBut in the chain, I have yubkpus is yapypus and kitwpus, and yapypus is wazxpus, but also from another point: \"yapypus is tumypus\" is not said. Let's check the given information carefully.\n\nThe given information: \"yubkpus is yapypus and kitwpus.\" and later \"yapypus is wazxpus.\" and also \"yapypus is tumypus.\"? No, I don't see that. Let's read all given:\n\n\"yubkpus is yapypus and kitwpus. siqxpus is zoqgpus. hexbpus is yektpus. fevhpus is qexzpus and rijxpus. nulqpus is jewmpus and yotspus. lojfpus is fevhpus. hiyrpus is qupkpus. lojfpus is boccpus. lojfpus is qolmpus. wazxpus is qocrpus and pevwpus. xudppus is vuqjpus and qedjpus. ciblpus is hitnpus and capcpus. qiytpus is yuctpus. jewmpus is xobppus and dustpus and xiznpus. hitnpus is hiyrpus. bojfpus is tescpus. fohvpus is yubkpus and cozmpus. vuffpus is hotfpus and dimkpus. jevwpus is lucqpus. peqcpus is jibppus and fergpus. siqxpus is jobxpus. jayxpus is xafrpus and lirfpus and furypus. xiylpus is zenmpus and cexdpus. peywpus is qutlpus. jufcpus is fohvpus and jibvpus. qexzpus is genvpus and wivspus. murypus is gifjpus. hitnpus is teycpus and lunvpus. jibppus is babbpus and tixdpus. zohcpus is ragypus. kexhpus is joqkpus. genvpus is jayxpus. vilwpus is xudppus. nulqpus is ciblpus. yuctpus is daclpus. dolmpus is jexypus and nadxpus. tescpus is hexbpus and xomppus. x is vuflpus. zenmpus is qiytpus. qupkpus is kexhpus and buhqpus. yapypus is wazxpus. joqkpus is varxpus and nelppus. vuflpus is faqrpus. vuqjpus is jufcpus and jazgpus. vuffpus is hobmpus. tumypus is siqxpus. faqrpus is xiylpus and pukmpus. ragypus is nulqpus and rimtpus and binmpus. varxpus is fodkpus. jexypus is risqpus. xobppus is diyrpus. xafrpus is mixnpus. jexypus is jevwpus. daclpus is zohcpus. mixnpus is labjpus. peywpus is yovypus. lucqpus is peqcpus and xohfpus. qocrpus is dolmpus and zilhpus. fodkpus is lojfpus. zoqgpus is bojfpus and riqvpus. labjpus is vilwpus and rekwpus. hobmpus is babcpus. diyrpus is peywpus. yektpus is vuffpus and laclpus. qocrpus is murypus. yapypus is tumypus. \"\n\nAh, at the very end, it says \"yapypus is tumypus.\" So yes, yapypus is tumypus.\n\nBut in my chain, I was going from jufcpus to fohvpus to yubkpus to yapypus, and yapypus is tumypus, but tumypus is siqxpus, and siqxpus is zoqgpus, etc. This seems long and not leading to jibppus.\n\nI need to find jibppus. jibppus is part of peqcpus: peqcpus is jibppus and fergpus.\n\nAnd peqcpus is also part of lucqpus: lucqpus is peqcpus and xohfpus.\n\nAnd lucqpus is jevwpus: jevwpus is lucqpus.\n\nAnd jevwpus is jexypus? jexypus is jevwpus? From given: \"jexypus is jevwpus.\" So jexypus is jevwpus.\n\nAnd jexypus is part of dolmpus: dolmpus is jexypus and nadxpus.\n\nAnd dolmpus is part of qocrpus: qocrpus is dolmpus and zilhpus.\n\nAnd qocrpus is part of wazxpus: wazxpus is qocrpus and pevwpus.\n\nAnd wazxpus is yapypus: yapypus is wazxpus.\n\nBut from earlier, x is lojfpus, and lojfpus is fevhpus, etc., but I need to connect to peqcpus or directly to jibppus.\n\nPerhaps from lojfpus, since lojfpus is fodkpus? From earlier, x is fodkpus because x is varxpus, varxpus is fodkpus, fodkpus is lojfpus, so x is lojfpus, which is consistent.\n\nBut lojfpus is also fevhpus, and fevhpus is qexzpus, and qexzpus is genvpus, and genvpus is jayxpus, and jayxpus is xafrpus, etc., but this doesn't lead to jibppus.\n\njibppus is from peqcpus, and peqcpus is from lucqpus, and lucqpus is from jevwpus, and jevwpus is from jexypus, and jexypus is from dolmpus, and dolmpus is from qocrpus, and qocrpus is from wazxpus, and wazxpus is from yapypus, and yapypus is from yubkpus, and yubkpus is from fohvpus, and fohvpus is from jufcpus, and jufcpus is from vuqjpus, and vuqjpus is from xudppus, and xudppus is from vilwpus, and vilwpus is from labjpus, and labjpus is from mixnpus, and mixnpus is from xafrpus, and xafrpus is from jayxpus, and jayxpus is from genvpus, and genvpus is from qexzpus, and qexzpus is from fevhpus, and fevhpus is from lojfpus! Oh! So there is a connection from lojfpus to jayxpus to eventually jibppus.\n\nLet's trace this carefully.\n\nlojfpus is fevhpus.\n\nfehvpus is qexzpus and rijxpus.\n\nqexzpus is genvpus and wivspus.\n\ngenvpus is jayxpus.\n\njayxpus is xafrpus and lirfpus and furypus.\n\nxafrpus is mixnpus.\n\nmixnpus is labjpus.\n\nlabjpus is vilwpus and rekwpus.\n\nvilwpus is xudppus.\n\nxudppus is vuqjpus and qedjpus.\n\nvuqjpus is jufcpus and jazgpus.\n\njufcpus is fohvpus and jibvpus.\n\nfohvpus is yubkpus and cozmpus.\n\nyubkpus is yapypus and kitwpus.\n\nyapypus is wazxpus. and also yapypus is tumypus.\n\nBut wazxpus is qocrpus and pevwpus.\n\nqocrpus is dolmpus and zilhpus. and also qocrpus is murypus? From given: \"qocrpus is murypus.\" but also \"qocrpus is dolmpus and zilhpus.\" So qocrpus has multiple categories.\n\ndolmpus is jexypus and nadxpus.\n\njexypus is jevwpus. and also jexypus is risqpus.\n\njevwpus is lucqpus.\n\nlucqpus is peqcpus and xohfpus.\n\npeqcpus is jibppus and fergpus.\n\njibppus is babbpus and tixdpus.\n\nSo, from lojfpus, through this long chain, we reach jibppus, which is babbpus. Therefore, since x is lojfpus, x is ultimately babbpus.\n\nBut is this true? We have to be careful because \"is\" means belongs to category, so if A is B, and B is C, then A is C, so it should be transitive.\n\nSo, from the chain, lojfpus is fevhpus, fevhpus is qexzpus, qexzpus is genvpus, genvpus is jayxpus, and so on, until peqcpus is jibppus, and jibppus is babbpus, so yes, lojfpus is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus.\n\nNow, for babcpus, we need to see if x is babcpus.\n\nbabcpus is from hobmpus: hobmpus is babcpus.\n\nAnd hobmpus is from vuffpus: vuffpus is hobmpus.\n\nAnd vuffpus is from yektpus: yektpus is vuffpus and laclpus.\n\nAnd yektpus is from hexbpus: hexbpus is yektpus.\n\nAnd hexbpus is from tescpus: tescpus is hexbpus and xomppus.\n\nAnd tescpus is from bojfpus: bojfpus is tescpus.\n\nAnd bojfpus is from zoqgpus: zoqgpus is bojfpus and riqvpus.\n\nAnd zoqgpus is from siqxpus: siqxpus is zoqgpus.\n\nAnd siqxpus is from tumypus: tumypus is siqxpus.\n\nAnd tumypus is from yapypus: yapypus is tumypus.\n\nBut from earlier, we have yapypus from other chains, but we need to connect to x.\n\nx is lojfpus, and we need to see if lojfpus is connected to vuffpus.\n\nFrom the chain above, we have yapypus, which is from yubkpus, which is from fohvpus, which is from jufcpus, which is from vuqjpus, which is from xudppus, which is from vilwpus, which is from labjpus, which is from mixnpus, which is from xafrpus, which is from jayxpus, which is from genvpus, which is from qexzpus, which is from fevhpus, which is from lojfpus. So lojfpus is connected to yapypus.\n\nBut from yapypus, we have tumypus, siqxpus, zoqgpus, bojfpus, tescpus, hexbpus, yektpus, vuffpus, hobmpus, babcpus.\n\nSo, since lojfpus is yapypus (through the chain), and yapypus is tumypus, etc., then lojfpus is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus.\n\nSo, x is both babbpus and babcpus.\n\nBut let's confirm if the chains are valid.\n\nFirst, for babbpus:\n\nx is vuflpus\n\nvuflpus is faqrpus\n\nfaqrpus is xiylpus\n\nxiylpus is zenmpus\n\nzenmpus is qiytpus\n\nqiytpus is yuctpus\n\nyuctpus is daclpus\n\ndaclpus is zohcpus\n\nzohcpus is ragypus\n\nragypus is nulqpus\n\nnulqpus is ciblpus\n\nciblpus is hitnpus\n\nhitnpus is hiyrpus\n\nhiyrpus is qupkpus\n\nqupkpus is kexhpus\n\nkexhpus is joqkpus\n\njoqkpus is varxpus\n\nvarxpus is fodkpus\n\nfodkpus is lojfpus\n\nSo x is lojfpus.\n\nNow, from lojfpus to babbpus:\n\nlojfpus is fevhpus\n\nfehvpus is qexzpus\n\nqexzpus is genvpus\n\ngenvpus is jayxpus\n\njayxpus is xafrpus\n\nxafrpus is mixnpus\n\nmixnpus is labjpus\n\nlabjpus is vilwpus\n\nvilwpus is xudppus\n\nxudppus is vuqjpus\n\nvuqjpus is jufcpus\n\njufcpus is fohvpus\n\nfohvpus is yubkpus\n\nyubkpus is yapypus\n\nyapypus is wazxpus  // but also yapypus is tumypus, but for this chain, we need wazxpus to get to qocrpus?\n\nFrom yapypus, we have yapypus is wazxpus, and also yapypus is tumypus, but for babbpus, we need to go through wazxpus? No, from jayxpus, we went to xafrpus, etc., to eventually reach peqcpus and jibppus.\n\nBut in the chain above, from jayxpus to xafrpus to mixnpus to labjpus to vilwpus to xudppus to vuqjpus to jufcpus to fohvpus to yubkpus to yapypus. But yapypus is already there? This seems circular? No, we are going from jayxpus to yapypus, but jayxpus is from genvpus, which is from qexzpus, which is from fevhpus, which is from lojfpus.\n\nBut after reaching yapypus, we need to go to wazxpus? But yapypus is wazxpus, so yapypus is wazxpus.\n\nThen wazxpus is qocrpus and pevwpus.\n\nThen qocrpus is dolmpus and zilhpus. (and also murypus, but we need dolmpus)\n\ndolmpus is jexypus and nadxpus.\n\njexypus is jevwpus. (and also risqpus)\n\njevwpus is lucqpus.\n\nlucqpus is peqcpus and xohfpus.\n\npeqcpus is jibppus and fergpus.\n\njibppus is babbpus and tixdpus.\n\nSo, indeed, lojfpus is babbpus.\n\nNow for babcpus:\n\nFrom lojfpus, we have lojfpus is fevhpus, and so on, up to yapypus as above.\n\nNow from yapypus, we need to go to babcpus.\n\nyapypus is tumypus? From given: \"yapypus is tumypus.\" so yapypus is tumypus.\n\ntumypus is siqxpus.\n\nsiqxpus is zoqgpus. (and also jobxpus, but we need zoqgpus)\n\nzoqgpus is bojfpus and riqvpus.\n\nbojfpus is tescpus.\n\ntescpus is hexbpus and xomppus.\n\nhexbpus is yektpus.\n\nyektpus is vuffpus and laclpus.\n\nvuffpus is hobmpus. (and also hotfpus and dimkpus)\n\nhobmpus is babcpus.\n\nSo, from yapypus, through tumypus, etc., to babcpus.\n\nTherefore, since lojfpus is yapypus, lojfpus is babcpus.\n\nThus, x is babcpus.\n\nSo, x is both babbpus and babcpus.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nBut the question is: \"x is babbpus and babcpus?\" which we have shown to be true.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's make sure there are no contradictions or missing links.\n\nAlso, note that in the chain for babcpus, we used yapypus is tumypus, which is given at the end.\n\nAnd all links seem consistent.\n\nTherefore, it is true.",

From given: \"jexypus is jevwpus.\" So jexypus is jevwpus.\n\nAnd jexypus is part of dolmpus: dolmpus is jexypus and nadxpus.\n\nAnd dolmpus is part of qocrpus: qocrpus is dolmpus and zilhpus.\n\nAnd qocrpus is part of wazxpus: wazxpus is qocrpus and pevwpus.\n\nAnd wazxpus is yapypus: yapypus is wazxpus.\n\nBut from earlier, x is lojfpus, and lojfpus is fevhpus, etc., but I need to connect to peqcpus or directly to jibppus.\n\nPerhaps from lojfpus, since lojfpus is fodkpus? From earlier, x is fodkpus because x is varxpus, varxpus is fodkpus, fodkpus is lojfpus, so x is lojfpus, which is consistent.\n\nBut lojfpus is also fevhpus, and fevhpus is qexzpus, and qexzpus is genvpus, and genvpus is jayxpus, and jayxpus is xafrpus, etc., but this doesn't lead to jibppus.\n\njibppus is from peqcpus, and peqcpus is from lucqpus, and lucqpus is from jevwpus, and jevwpus is from jexypus, and jexypus is from dolmpus, and dolmpus is from qocrpus, and qocrpus is from wazxpus, and wazxpus is from yapypus, and yapypus is from yubkpus, and yubkpus is from fohvpus, and fohvpus is from jufcpus, and jufcpus is from vuqjpus, and vuqjpus is from xudppus, and xudppus is from vilwpus, and vilwpus is from labjpus, and labjpus is from mixnpus, and mixnpus is from xafrpus, and xafrpus is from jayxpus, and jayxpus is from genvpus, and genvpus is from qexzpus, and qexzpus is from fevhpus, and fevhpus is from lojfpus! Oh! So there is a connection from lojfpus to jayxpus to eventually jibppus.\n\nLet's trace this carefully.\n\nlojfpus is fevhpus.\n\nfehvpus is qexzpus and rijxpus.\n\nqexzpus is genvpus and wivspus.\n\ngenvpus is jayxpus.\n\njayxpus is xafrpus and lirfpus and furypus.\n\nxafrpus is mixnpus.\n\nmixnpus is labjpus.\n\nlabjpus is vilwpus and rekwpus.\n\nvilwpus is xudppus.\n\nxudppus is vuqjpus and qedjpus.\n\nvuqjpus is jufcpus and jazgpus.\n\njufcpus is fohvpus and jibvpus.\n\nfohvpus is yubkpus and cozmpus.\n\nyubkpus is yapypus and kitwpus.\n\nyapypus is wazxpus. and also yapypus is tumypus.\n\nBut wazxpus is qocrpus and pevwpus.\n\nqocrpus is dolmpus and zilhpus. and also qocrpus is murypus? From given: \"qocrpus is murypus.\" but also \"qocrpus is dolmpus and zilhpus.\" So qocrpus has multiple categories.\n\ndolmpus is jexypus and nadxpus.\n\njexypus is jevwpus. and also jexypus is risqpus.\n\njevwpus is lucqpus.\n\nlucqpus is peqcpus and xohfpus.\n\npeqcpus is jibppus and fergpus.\n\njibppus is babbpus and tixdpus.\n\nSo, from lojfpus, through this long chain, we reach jibppus, which is babbpus. Therefore, since x is lojfpus, x is ultimately babbpus.\n\nBut is this true? We have to be careful because \"is\" means belongs to category, so if A is B, and B is C, then A is C, so it should be transitive.\n\nSo, from the chain, lojfpus is fevhpus, fevhpus is qexzpus, qexzpus is genvpus, genvpus is jayxpus, and so on, until peqcpus is jibppus, and jibppus is babbpus, so yes, lojfpus is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus.\n\nNow, for babcpus, we need to see if x is babcpus.\n\nbabcpus is from hobmpus: hobmpus is babcpus.\n\nAnd hobmpus is from vuffpus: vuffpus is hobmpus.\n\nAnd vuffpus is from yektpus: yektpus is vuffpus and laclpus.\n\nAnd yektpus is from hexbpus: hexbpus is yektpus.\n\nAnd hexbpus is from tescpus: tescpus is hexbpus and xomppus.\n\nAnd tescpus is from bojfpus: bojfpus is tescpus.\n\nAnd bojfpus is from zoqgpus: zoqgpus is bojfpus and riqvpus.\n\nAnd zoqgpus is from siqxpus: siqxpus is zoqgpus.\n\nAnd siqxpus is from tumypus: tumypus is siqxpus.\n\nAnd tumypus is from yapypus: yapypus is tumypus.\n\nBut from earlier, we have yapypus from other chains, but we need to connect to x.\n\nx is lojfpus, and we need to see if lojfpus is connected to vuffpus.\n\nFrom the chain above, we have yapypus, which is from yubkpus, which is from fohvpus, which is from jufcpus, which is from vuqjpus, which is from xudppus, which is from vilwpus, which is from labjpus, which is from mixnpus, which is from xafrpus, which is from jayxpus, which is from genvpus, which is from qexzpus, which is from fevhpus, which is from lojfpus. So lojfpus is connected to yapypus.\n\nBut from yapypus, we have tumypus, siqxpus, zoqgpus, bojfpus, tescpus, hexbpus, yektpus, vuffpus, hobmpus, babcpus.\n\nSo, since lojfpus is yapypus (through the chain), and yapypus is tumypus, etc., then lojfpus is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus.\n\nSo, x is both babbpus and babcpus.\n\nBut let's confirm if the chains are valid.\n\nFirst, for babbpus:\n\nx is vuflpus\n\nvuflpus is faqrpus\n\nfaqrpus is xiylpus\n\nxiylpus is zenmpus\n\nzenmpus is qiytpus\n\nqiytpus is yuctpus\n\nyuctpus is daclpus\n\ndaclpus is zohcpus\n\nzohcpus is ragypus\n\nragypus is nulqpus\n\nnulqpus is ciblpus\n\nciblpus is hitnpus\n\nhitnpus is hiyrpus\n\nhiyrpus is qupkpus\n\nqupkpus is kexhpus\n\nkexhpus is joqkpus\n\njoqkpus is varxpus\n\nvarxpus is fodkpus\n\nfodkpus is lojfpus\n\nSo x is lojfpus.\n\nNow, from lojfpus to babbpus:\n\nlojfpus is fevhpus\n\nfehvpus is qexzpus\n\nqexzpus is genvpus\n\ngenvpus is jayxpus\n\njayxpus is xafrpus\n\nxafrpus is mixnpus\n\nmixnpus is labjpus\n\nlabjpus is vilwpus\n\nvilwpus is xudppus\n\nxudppus is vuqjpus\n\nvuqjpus is jufcpus\n\njufcpus is fohvpus\n\nfohvpus is yubkpus\n\nyubkpus is yapypus\n\nyapypus is wazxpus  // but also yapypus is tumypus, but for this chain, we need wazxpus to get to qocrpus?\n\nFrom yapypus, we have yapypus is wazxpus, and also yapypus is tumypus, but for babbpus, we need to go through wazxpus? No, from jayxpus, we went to xafrpus, etc., to eventually reach peqcpus and jibppus.\n\nBut in the chain above, from jayxpus to xafrpus to mixnpus to labjpus to vilwpus to xudppus to vuqjpus to jufcpus to fohvpus to yubkpus to yapypus. But yapypus is already there? This seems circular? No, we are going from jayxpus to yapypus, but jayxpus is from genvpus, which is from qexzpus, which is from fevhpus, which is from lojfpus.\n\nBut after reaching yapypus, we need to go to wazxpus? But yapypus is wazxpus, so yapypus is wazxpus.\n\nThen wazxpus is qocrpus and pevwpus.\n\nThen qocrpus is dolmpus and zilhpus. (and also murypus, but we need dolmpus)\n\ndolmpus is jexypus and nadxpus.\n\njexypus is jevwpus. (and also risqpus)\n\njevwpus is lucqpus.\n\nlucqpus is peqcpus and xohfpus.\n\npeqcpus is jibppus and fergpus.\n\njibppus is babbpus and tixdpus.\n\nSo, indeed, lojfpus is babbpus.\n\nNow for babcpus:\n\nFrom lojfpus, we have lojfpus is fevhpus, and so on, up to yapypus as above.\n\nNow from yapypus, we need to go to babcpus.\n\nyapypus is tumypus? From given: \"yapypus is tumypus.\" so yapypus is tumypus.\n\ntumypus is siqxpus.\n\nsiqxpus is zoqgpus. (and also jobxpus, but we need zoqgpus)\n\nzoqgpus is bojfpus and riqvpus.\n\nbojfpus is tescpus.\n\ntescpus is hexbpus and xomppus.\n\nhexbpus is yektpus.\n\nyektpus is vuffpus and laclpus.\n\nvuffpus is hobmpus. (and also hotfpus and dimkpus)\n\nhobmpus is babcpus.\n\nSo, from yapypus, through tumypus, etc., to babcpus.\n\nTherefore, since lojfpus is yapypus, lojfpus is babcpus.\n\nThus, x is babcpus.\n\nSo, x is both babbpus and babcpus.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nBut the question is: \"x is babbpus and babcpus?\" which we have shown to be true.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's make sure there are no contradictions or missing links.\n\nAlso, note that in the chain for babcpus, we used yapypus is tumypus, which is given at the end.\n\nAnd all links seem consistent.\n\nTherefore, it is true.",

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nTherefore, it is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus. From the given information, x is defined as kolgpus and cudypus. But I don't see any direct connection to babbpus yet. I need to trace through the relationships.\n\nLet me list out what I know about babbpus. From the information: hesbpus is babbpus. And hesbpus is mentioned in culqpus is hesbpus and nijlpus. Also, bicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus. And nutcpus is bicwpus. Then noczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus. And bescpus is noczpus. And yevjpus is bescpus. And yokppus is yevjpus and caztpus. And pemjpus is yokppus. And zumtpus is pemjpus and pafbpus. And fatdpus is zumtpus. And tasmpus is fatdpus and vakhpus? Wait, no: from hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus, and tasmpus is hijnpus? Let's see: lucfpus is tasmpus and rojhpus, and tasmpus is hijnpus? Actually, from the info: tasmpus is hijnpus. And hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus. So tasmpus is hijnpus, which means tasmpus belongs to hijnpus, and hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus, so tasmpus is fatdpus and vakhpus? But that might not be direct. I need to be careful with the \"is\" meaning belonging to category.\n\nPerhaps I should think in terms of sets or categories. \"A is B\" means A is a subset of B or A is an instance of B. But since multiple things can be B, it might be that B is a category containing A.\n\nMy goal is to see if x is babbpus. So I need to see if x is in the category babbpus.\n\nx is kolgpus and cudypus. But I don't know what cudypus is. Looking through the information, I don't see cudypus mentioned anywhere else. That might be a problem. Let me check all the given statements.\n\nI have: yorvpus is yortpus. zumtpus is pemjpus and pafbpus. bumfpus is pulmpus and nevmpus. culqpus is hesbpus and nijlpus. tarrpus is pajwpus and kewfpus. lucfpus is tasmpus and rojhpus. kolgpus is kinkpus. toqnpus is duhspus. bescpus is noczpus. tixspus is zoxnpus. nucrpus is mizwpus. rabwpus is bumfpus. pemjpus is yokppus. vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus. najkpus is rabwpus. yortpus is lucfpus and debnpus. noswpus is zuxnpus and pekzpus and wehzpus. cefnpus is rifypus. pesspus is tarrpus. xujppus is cefnpus and bonrpus. mizwpus is kivhpus. wuyspus is mupdpus and sahbpus. nutcpus is bicwpus. yesmpus is pesspus. woklpus is luqmpus and piwspus. ketwpus is qusmpus. hiwhpus is nucrpus and luykpus. hesbpus is babbpus. tasmpus is hijnpus. yokppus is yevjpus and caztpus. fatdpus is zumtpus. zuxnpus is yijwpus and rokwpus. yevjpus is bescpus. dijmpus is morppus and mojkpus and zavkpus and jucnpus. bicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus. bikzpus is ketwpus. kivhpus is dijmpus and qahgpus. nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus. qapkpus is vigwpus. hesbpus is lodmpus. vuktpus is toqnpus and yakkpus. x is kolgpus and cudypus. kinkpus is sexmpus and wocjpus. kolgpus is bidjpus. damrpus is yeclpus. luqmpus is noswpus and yumtpus. damrpus is qapkpus. qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus. sexmpus is hiwhpus and cizcpus and jitnpus. yijwpus is yorvpus. mupdpus is woklpus. hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus. morppus is yesmpus. pajwpus is tixspus. zoxnpus is xuznpus and hiprpus. nutcpus is najkpus. noczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus. xuznpus is xujppus. rifypus is vuktpus. duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus.\n\nI don't see cudypus anywhere else. So for x, we have x is kolgpus and cudypus. But since cudypus is not defined, I might not be able to trace it. However, the question is about x is babbpus, so perhaps through kolgpus, we can find a path, but kolgpus might not be related to babbpus.\n\nLet me try to find a path from kolgpus to babbpus.\n\nFirst, kolgpus is kinkpus. And kinkpus is sexmpus and wocjpus. And sexmpus is hiwhpus and cizcpus and jitnpus. hiwhpus is nucrpus and luykpus. nucrpus is mizwpus. mizwpus is kivhpus. kivhpus is dijmpus and qahgpus. dijmpus is morppus and mojkpus and zavkpus and jucnpus. morppus is yesmpus. yesmpus is pesspus. pesspus is tarrpus. tarrpus is pajwpus and kewfpus. pajwpus is tixspus. tixspus is zoxnpus. zoxnpus is xuznpus and hiprpus. xuznpus is xujppus. xujppus is cefnpus and bonrpus. cefnpus is rifypus. rifypus is vuktpus. vuktpus is toqnpus and yakkpus. toqnpus is duhspus. duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus. nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus. damrpus is yeclpus? Also, damrpus is qapkpus? From above: damrpus is yeclpus and also damrpus is qapkpus? Let's see: from \"damrpus is yeclpus\" and then \"damrpus is qapkpus\"? But that might mean damrpus belongs to yeclpus and also to qapkpus, but that could be multiple categories.\n\nAlso, from \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\" and \"duhspus is nesspus and ...\" so duhspus includes nesspus, which includes damrpus.\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus. babbpus is related to hesbpus. hesbpus is babbpus. And hesbpus is part of culqpus. culqpus is hesbpus and nijlpus. And bicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus. And nutcpus is bicwpus. And noczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus. And bescpus is noczpus. And yevjpus is bescpus. And yokppus is yevjpus and caztpus. And pemjpus is yokppus. And zumtpus is pemjpus and pafbpus. And fatdpus is zumtpus. And hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus. And tasmpus is hijnpus. And lucfpus is tasmpus and rojhpus. And yortpus is lucfpus and debnpus. And yorvpus is yortpus. And yijwpus is yorvpus. And zuxnpus is yijwpus and rokwpus. And noswpus is zuxnpus and pekzpus and wehzpus. And luqmpus is noswpus and yumtpus. And woklpus is luqmpus and piwspus. And mupdpus is woklpus. And wuyspus is mupdpus and sahbpus. And vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus. And qapkpus is vigwpus. And damrpus is qapkpus? From above: damrpus is qapkpus? But also damrpus is yeclpus? And from nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus, so damrpus is part of nesspus.\n\nBut this seems very convoluted, and I don't see any connection from kolgpus to babbpus. kolgpus is going down a different path towards duhspus and nesspus, but babbpus is from hesbpus, which is from culqpus, which is from bicwpus, etc., and that path seems separate.\n\nPerhaps through some common point? But from the chains, I don't see overlap.\n\nWhat about cudypus? Since x is also cudypus, and if cudypus is related to babbpus, but cudypus is not defined anywhere, so I have no information about cudypus. Therefore, I cannot conclude that x is babbpus based on kolgpus alone, and since cudypus is unknown, it might be that cudypus is babbpus, but I don't know.\n\nThe question is whether x is babbpus. Since x is kolgpus and cudypus, for x to be babbpus, both kolgpus and cudypus must be babbpus, or perhaps x is a category that includes babbpus, but from \"x is kolgpus and cudypus\", it means x belongs to kolgpus and to cudypus, so x is an instance of both, but for x to be babbpus, it must be that x is in the set babbpus.\n\nBut since I don't know what cudypus is, I can't say that x is babbpus.\n\nPerhaps from the relationships, I can find if kolgpus is babbpus, but from above, kolgpus is kinkpus, which is sexmpus, etc., and that chain doesn't lead to babbpus.\n\nLet me see if there is any connection between the two chains.\n\nNotice that from duhspus, we have nesspus, which has damrpus, and damrpus is qapkpus, and qapkpus is vigwpus, etc., but also from bescpus, we have noczpus, which has nutcpus, which is bicwpus, which is culqpus, which has hesbpus, which is babbpus.\n\nBut kolgpus is on the duhspus side, not on the bescpus side.\n\nUnless through some other relation.\n\nWhat about yijwpus? yijwpus is yorvpus, and yorvpus is yortpus, and yortpus is lucfpus and debnpus, and lucfpus is tasmpus and rojhpus, and tasmpus is hijnpus, and hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus, and fatdpus is zumtpus, and zumtpus is pemjpus and pafbpus, and pemjpus is yokppus, and yokppus is yevjpus and caztpus, and yevjpus is bescpus, and bescpus is noczpus, and noczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus, and nutcpus is bicwpus, and bicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus, and culqpus is hesbpus and nijlpus, and hesbpus is babbpus.\n\nSo from yijwpus, we can get to babbpus. But kolgpus is not directly connected to yijwpus. kolgpus is kinkpus, which is sexmpus, which is hiwhpus, which is nucrpus, which is mizwpus, which is kivhpus, which is dijmpus, which is morppus, which is yesmpus, which is pesspus, which is tarrpus, which is pajwpus, which is tixspus, which is zoxnpus, which is xuznpus, which is xujppus, which is cefnpus, which is rifypus, which is vuktpus, which is toqnpus, which is duhspus, and duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus, and nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus, and damrpus is yeclpus? and also damrpus is qapkpus? from earlier: \"damrpus is qapkpus\" but also \"damrpus is yeclpus\"? Let's see the statements: \"damrpus is yeclpus\" and then \"damrpus is qapkpus\" – this might be that damrpus belongs to yeclpus and also to qapkpus, so yeclpus and qapkpus are categories that include damrpus.\n\nBut from \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\", so damrpus is part of nesspus.\n\nNow, qapkpus is vigwpus, and vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus, and wuyspus is mupdpus and sahbpus, and mupdpus is woklpus, and woklpus is luqmpus and piwspus, and luqmpus is noswpus and yumtpus, and noswpus is zuxnpus and pekzpus and wehzpus, and zuxnpus is yijwpus and rokwpus, and yijwpus is yorvpus, and from yorvpus we can go to babbpus as above.\n\nSo, from damrpus is qapkpus, and qapkpus is vigwpus, etc., eventually to yijwpus, which leads to babbpus. But damrpus is also part of nesspus, which is part of duhspus, which is from toqnpus, etc., from kolgpus chain.\n\nSo, from kolgpus, we have toqnpus, which is duhspus, which includes nesspus, which includes damrpus, and damrpus is qapkpus, and through qapkpus, we go to vigwpus, to wuyspus, to mupdpus, to woklpus, to luqmpus, to noswpus, to zuxnpus, to yijwpus, to yorvpus, to yortpus, to lucfpus, to tasmpus, to hijnpus, to fatdpus, to zumtpus, to pemjpus, to yokppus, to yevjpus, to bescpus, to noczpus, to nutcpus, to bicwpus, to culqpus, to hesbpus, to babbpus.\n\nSo, theoretically, there is a path from kolgpus to babbpus through this long chain.\n\nBut is this path valid? Let's see the connections step by step.\n\nStart from kolgpus: kolgpus is kinkpus. (from \"kolgpus is kinkpus\")\n\nkinkpus is sexmpus and wocjpus. (from \"kinkpus is sexmpus and wocjpus\")\n\nsexmpus is hiwhpus and cizcpus and jitnpus. (from \"sexmpus is hiwhpus and cizcpus and jitnpus\")\n\nhiwhpus is nucrpus and luykpus. (from \"hiwhpus is nucrpus and luykpus\")\n\nnucrpus is mizwpus. (from \"nucrpus is mizwpus\")\n\nmizwpus is kivhpus. (from \"mizwpus is kivhpus\")\n\nkivhpus is dijmpus and qahgpus. (from \"kivhpus is dijmpus and qahgpus\")\n\ndijmpus is morppus and mojkpus and zavkpus and jucnpus. (from \"dijmpus is morppus and mojkpus and zavkpus and jucnpus\")\n\nmorppus is yesmpus. (from \"morppus is yesmpus\")\n\nyesmpus is pesspus. (from \"yesmpus is pesspus\")\n\npesspus is tarrpus. (from \"pesspus is tarrpus\")\n\ntarrpus is pajwpus and kewfpus. (from \"tarrpus is pajwpus and kewfpus\")\n\npajwpus is tixspus. (from \"pajwpus is tixspus\")\n\ntixspus is zoxnpus. (from \"tixspus is zoxnpus\")\n\nzoxnpus is xuznpus and hiprpus. (from \"zoxnpus is xuznpus and hiprpus\")\n\nxuznpus is xujppus. (from \"xuznpus is xujppus\")\n\nxujppus is cefnpus and bonrpus. (from \"xujppus is cefnpus and bonrpus\")\n\ncefnpus is rifypus. (from \"cefnpus is rifypus\")\n\nrifypus is vuktpus. (from \"rifypus is vuktpus\")\n\nvuktpus is toqnpus and yakkpus. (from \"vuktpus is toqnpus and yakkpus\")\n\ntoqnpus is duhspus. (from \"toqnpus is duhspus\")\n\nduhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus. (from \"duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus\")\n\nnesspus is damrpus and cojzpus. (from \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\")\n\nSo from nesspus, we have damrpus.\n\nNow, damrpus is mentioned in other places. From the information: \"damrpus is yeclpus\" and \"damrpus is qapkpus\". So damrpus belongs to yeclpus and also to qapkpus.\n\nWe need to go to babbpus, so we use damrpus is qapkpus.\n\nqapkpus is vigwpus. (from \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" – wait, is that stated? Let's see: from \"qapkpus is vigwpus\"? I think I have it. From the list: \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" – yes, from \"qapkpus is vigwpus\"?\nLooking back: I have \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" in the list? Let's find: from the given information: \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" – I don't see it directly. Let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the given: \"vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus.\" and then \"qapkpus is vigwpus\"? No, I think I missed it. Let's scan the information.\n\nI see: \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" is not explicitly stated. Instead, I have: \"qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus.\" and also \"damrpus is qapkpus\" but that doesn't say qapkpus is vigwpus.\n\nWhere is qapkpus related to vigwpus? From earlier, I thought from \"damrpus is qapkpus\" and then qapkpus is something, but let's see the chain.\n\nI have: \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\" and \"duhspus is nesspus and ...\" so damrpus is part of nesspus.\n\nBut from other statements: \"damrpus is qapkpus\" – this means damrpus belongs to qapkpus, so qapkpus is a category that contains damrpus.\n\nAlso, \"qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus\" – so qapkpus belongs to bikzpus and budzpus.\n\nBut for going to vigwpus, I need to see if qapkpus is related to vigwpus.\n\nFrom the information: \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" is not stated. Instead, I have: \"vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus\" and \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" is not there.\n\nBut I also have: \"damrpus is yeclpus\" and \"damrpus is qapkpus\" but that doesn't help.\n\nAnother statement: \"qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus\" and \"bikzpus is ketwpus\" and \"ketwpus is qusmpus\" which doesn't lead to vigwpus.\n\nHow did I think that qapkpus is vigwpus? I think I confused it with something else.\n\nLet's list all statements involving qapkpus.\n\nFrom the given:\n\n- qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus.  (from \"qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus\")\n\n- damrpus is qapkpus.  (from \"damrpus is qapkpus\")\n\nAlso, from earlier: \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\" so damrpus is in nesspus.\n\nBut where is vigwpus? vigwpus is mentioned in: \"vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus\" and also \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" is not stated.\n\nBut I also have: \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" is not in the list. Let's read the initial information again.\n\nI see: \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" is not there. Instead, I have: \" yesmpus is pesspus. woklpus is luqmpus and piwspus. ketwpus is qusmpus. hiwhpus is nucrpus and luykpus. hesbpus is babbpus. tasmpus is hijnpus. yokppus is yevjpus and caztpus. fatdpus is zumtpus. zuxnpus is yijwpus and rokwpus. yevjpus is bescpus. dijmpus is morppus and mojkpus and zavkpus and jucnpus. bicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus. bikzpus is ketwpus. kivhpus is dijmpus and qahgpus. nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus. qapkpus is vigwpus. hesbpus is lodmpus. vuktpus is toqnpus and yakkpus. x is kolgpus and cudypus. kinkpus is sexmpus and wocjpus. kolgpus is bidjpus. damrpus is yeclpus. luqmpus is noswpus and yumtpus. damrpus is qapkpus. qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus. sexmpus is hiwhpus and cizcpus and jitnpus. yijwpus is yorvpus. mupdpus is woklpus. hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus. morppus is yesmpus. pajwpus is tixspus. zoxnpus is xuznpus and hiprpus. nutcpus is najkpus. noczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus. xuznpus is xujppus. rifypus is vuktpus. duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus.\"\n\nWait! I missed it: in the list, after \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus.\" there is \"qapkpus is vigwpus.\" Yes! It is there: \"qapkpus is vigwpus.\" So yes, qapkpus is vigwpus.\n\nSo, from damrpus is qapkpus, and qapkpus is vigwpus, so damrpus is vigwpus? But since damrpus is qapkpus and qapkpus is vigwpus, it means damrpus belongs to qapkpus, and qapkpus belongs to vigwpus, so damrpus is also in vigwpus? But careful: \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if damrpus is qapkpus, that means damrpus is a member of qapkpus category, and qapkpus is vigwpus, meaning qapkpus is a member of vigwpus category, so damrpus is a member of vigwpus category? Not necessarily directly, but through membership: if A is B and B is C, then A is C? In set terms, if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C, then A ⊆ C. But here \"is\" might mean \"is a subset of\" or \"is an instance of\". Typically in such problems, if A is B and B is C, then A is C. So I think we can infer that damrpus is vigwpus.\n\nSimilarly, from the chain, we can continue.\n\nSo, damrpus is vigwpus (since damrpus is qapkpus and qapkpus is vigwpus).\n\nvigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus. (from \"vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is wuyspus and zudkpus? But since vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus, it means vigwpus belongs to wuyspus and to zudkpus, so if damrpus is vigwpus, then damrpus is wuyspus and zudkpus.\n\nBut we need to go to wuyspus for the chain.\n\nwuyspus is mupdpus and sahbpus. (from \"wuyspus is mupdpus and sahbpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is mupdpus and sahbpus? Since damrpus is wuyspus, and wuyspus is mupdpus, so damrpus is mupdpus.\n\nSimilarly, mupdpus is woklpus. (from \"mupdpus is woklpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is woklpus.\n\nwoklpus is luqmpus and piwspus. (from \"woklpus is luqmpus and piwspus\")\n\nSo damrpus is luqmpus and piwspus.\n\nluqmpus is noswpus and yumtpus. (from \"luqmpus is noswpus and yumtpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is noswpus and yumtpus.\n\nnoswpus is zuxnpus and pekzpus and wehzpus. (from \"noswpus is zuxnpus and pekzpus and wehzpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is zuxnpus and pekzpus and wehzpus.\n\nzuxnpus is yijwpus and rokwpus. (from \"zuxnpus is yijwpus and rokwpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is yijwpus and rokwpus.\n\nyijwpus is yorvpus. (from \"yijwpus is yorvpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is yorvpus.\n\nyorvpus is yortpus. (from \"yorvpus is yortpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is yortpus.\n\nyortpus is lucfpus and debnpus. (from \"yortpus is lucfpus and debnpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is lucfpus and debnpus.\n\nlucfpus is tasmpus and rojhpus. (from \"lucfpus is tasmpus and rojhpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is tasmpus and rojhpus.\n\ntasmpus is hijnpus. (from \"tasmpus is hijnpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is hijnpus.\n\nhijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus. (from \"hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is fatdpus and vakhpus.\n\nfatdpus is zumtpus. (from \"fatdpus is zumtpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is zumtpus.\n\nzumtpus is pemjpus and pafbpus. (from \"zumtpus is pemjpus and pafbpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is pemjpus and pafbpus.\n\npemjpus is yokppus. (from \"pemjpus is yokppus\")\n\nSo damrpus is yokppus.\n\nyokppus is yevjpus and caztpus. (from \"yokppus is yevjpus and caztpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is yevjpus and caztpus.\n\nyevjpus is bescpus. (from \"yevjpus is bescpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is bescpus.\n\nbescpus is noczpus. (from \"bescpus is noczpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is noczpus.\n\nnoczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus. (from \"noczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus.\n\nnutcpus is bicwpus. (from \"nutcpus is bicwpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is bicwpus.\n\nbicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus. (from \"bicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is culqpus and nenxpus.\n\nculqpus is hesbpus and nijlpus. (from \"culqpus is hesbpus and nijlpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is hesbpus and nijlpus.\n\nhesbpus is babbpus. (from \"hesbpus is babbpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, damrpus is babbpus.\n\nNow, recall that from the kolgpus chain, we have that nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus, so damrpus is part of nesspus.\n\nAnd from kolgpus, we went through to duhspus, which is nesspus, so duhspus includes nesspus, which includes damrpus.\n\nBut we need to see if kolgpus itself is babbpus. From the chain, kolgpus leads to damrpus, and damrpus is babbpus, but does that mean kolgpus is babbpus?\n\nLet's see the path: from kolgpus is kinkpus, and so on, up to duhspus is nesspus, and nesspus is damrpus, so duhspus contains damrpus. But kolgpus is not necessarily damrpus; rather, kolgpus is connected to duhspus, which contains damrpus.\n\nBut for kolgpus to be babbpus, we need kolgpus to be a subset of babbpus or an instance of babbpus.\n\nFrom the relationships, since kolgpus is kinkpus, and kinkpus is sexmpus, etc., and eventually, through the chain, we have that duhspus contains nesspus, which contains damrpus, and damrpus is babbpus.\n\nBut does that imply that kolgpus is babbpus? Not directly. Because kolgpus may be a category that includes duhspus, but from the \"is\" statements, we have that kolgpus is kinkpus, meaning kolgpus belongs to kinkpus, so kolgpus is a member of kinkpus. Similarly, kinkpus is a member of sexmpus, and so on. So, following the chain, since each \"is\" indicates membership, we can infer that kolgpus is a member of each subsequent category.\n\nSpecifically, from kolgpus is kinkpus, and kinkpus is sexmpus, so kolgpus is sexmpus. Similarly, kolgpus is hiwhpus, and so on, all the way to kolgpus is duhspus? Let's see.\n\nFrom toqnpus is duhspus, and vuktpus is toqnpus, and rifypus is vuktpus, and cefnpus is rifypus, and xujppus is cefnpus, and xuznpus is xujppus, and zoxnpus is xuznpus, and tixspus is zoxnpus, and pajwpus is tixspus, and tarrpus is pajwpus, and pesspus is tarrpus, and yesmpus is pesspus, and morppus is yesmpus, and dijmpus is morppus, and kivhpus is dijmpus, and mizwpus is kivhpus, and nucrpus is mizwpus, and hiwhpus is nucrpus, and sexmpus is hiwhpus, and kinkpus is sexmpus, and kolgpus is kinkpus.\n\nSo, since kolgpus is kinkpus, and kinkpus is sexmpus, so kolgpus is sexmpus. Similarly, kolgpus is hiwhpus (since sexmpus is hiwhpus), and so on, up to kolgpus is duhspus? Let's see the step to duhspus.\n\nWe have duhspus is related to toqnpus. toqnpus is duhspus? From \"toqnpus is duhspus\", so toqnpus belongs to duhspus.\n\nBut from the chain, we have vuktpus is toqnpus, so vuktpus is toqnpus, and since toqnpus is duhspus, so vuktpus is duhspus.\n\nSimilarly, rifypus is vuktpus, so rifypus is duhspus.\n\ncefnpus is rifypus, so cefnpus is duhspus.\n\nxujppus is cefnpus, so xujppus is duhspus.\n\nxuznpus is xujppus, so xuznpus is duhspus.\n\nzoxnpus is xuznpus, so zoxnpus is duhspus.\n\ntixspus is zoxnpus, so tixspus is duhspus.\n\npajwpus is tixspus, so pajwpus is duhspus.\n\ntarrpus is pajwpus, so tarrpus is duhspus.\n\npesspus is tarrpus, so pesspus is duhspus.\n\nyesmpus is pesspus, so yesmpus is duhspus.\n\nmorppus is yesmpus, so morppus is duhspus.\n\ndijmpus is morppus, so dijmpus is duhspus.\n\nkivhpus is dijmpus, so kivhpus is duhspus.\n\nmizwpus is kivhpus, so mizwpus is duhspus.\n\nnucrpus is mizwpus, so nucrpus is duhspus.\n\nhiwhpus is nucrpus, so hiwhpus is duhspus.\n\nsexmpus is hiwhpus, so sexmpus is duhspus.\n\nkinkpus is sexmpus, so kinkpus is duhspus.\n\nkolgpus is kinkpus, so kolgpus is duhspus.\n\nTherefore, kolgpus is duhspus.\n\nNow, duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus. So duhspus belongs to nesspus, etc. But since duhspus is nesspus, meaning duhspus is a member of nesspus? From \"duhspus is nesspus and ...\" it means duhspus belongs to nesspus and to mehgpus, etc.\n\nSo, since kolgpus is duhspus, and duhspus is nesspus, so kolgpus is nesspus.\n\nnesspus is damrpus and cojzpus. So nesspus belongs to damrpus? No: from \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\", it means that nesspus is a member of damrpus and cojzpus? That would be unusual because typically, if A is B, it means A is contained in B, but here \"nesspus is damrpus\" might mean that nesspus is a subset of damrpus or that damrpus contains nesspus.\n\nLet's think about the meaning. The note says: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \", so it could be that A is a subset of B or A is an instance of B. But in most logic, if A is B, it means B is a category and A is in B.\n\nBut when we have \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\", it means that nesspus belongs to both damrpus and cojzpus categories. So damrpus is a category that contains nesspus.\n\nSimilarly, from earlier, we have damrpus is babbpus, meaning damrpus belongs to babbpus category.\n\nBut for kolgpus to be babbpus, we need kolgpus to be in babbpus category.\n\nWe have kolgpus is nesspus (since kolgpus is duhspus and duhspus is nesspus, so kolgpus is nesspus).\n\nAnd nesspus is damrpus (since nesspus belongs to damrpus category).\n\nSo kolgpus is damrpus? Because if kolgpus is nesspus and nesspus is damrpus, then kolgpus is damrpus.\n\nThen, since damrpus is babbpus, so kolgpus is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, kolgpus is babbpus.\n\nNow, x is kolgpus and cudypus. So since x is kolgpus, and kolgpus is babbpus, then x is babbpus.\n\nWe don't even need cudypus for this conclusion.\n\nSo, it seems that x is babbpus.\n\nBut let's confirm the steps.\n\nWe have kolgpus is kinkpus, and through the chain, we derived kolgpus is duhspus.\n\nduhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus. So duhspus is nesspus, meaning duhspus belongs to nesspus category.\n\nThus, since kolgpus is duhspus, so kolgpus is nesspus.\n\nnesspus is damrpus and cojzpus, so nesspus belongs to damrpus category.\n\nThus, kolgpus is damrpus? Yes, because kolgpus is nesspus and nesspus is damrpus, so kolgpus is damrpus.\n\nThen, from earlier, we have damrpus is babbpus (as derived from damrpus is qapkpus, qapkpus is vigwpus, etc., up to damrpus is hesbpus, and hesbpus is babbpus).\n\nSo damrpus is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, kolgpus is babbpus.\n\nSince x is kolgpus, x is babbpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut the question is: \"Is it true or false or unknown: x is babbpus?\"\n\nBased on this, it is true.\n\nI should ensure that all steps are valid.\n\nOne potential issue: in the chain from damrpus to babbpus, we used damrpus is qapkpus, but damrpus is also yeclpus, but that doesn't affect the reasoning.\n\nAlso, from kolgpus to damrpus, we used that nesspus is damrpus, which is from \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\", so that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus.\n\nSo, the answer is true.",
  "thinking_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus. From the given information, x is defined as kolgpus and cudypus. But I don't see any direct connection to babbpus yet. I need to trace through the relationships.\n\nLet me list out what I know about babbpus. From the information: hesbpus is babbpus. And hesbpus is mentioned in culqpus is hesbpus and nijlpus. Also, bicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus. And nutcpus is bicwpus. Then noczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus. And bescpus is noczpus. And yevjpus is bescpus. And yokppus is yevjpus and caztpus. And pemjpus is yokppus. And zumtpus is pemjpus and pafbpus. And fatdpus is zumtpus. And tasmpus is fatdpus and vakhpus? Wait, no: from hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus, and tasmpus is hijnpus? Let's see: lucfpus is tasmpus and rojhpus, and tasmpus is hijnpus? Actually, from the info: tasmpus is hijnpus. And hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus. So tasmpus is hijnpus, which means tasmpus belongs to hijnpus, and hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus, so tasmpus is fatdpus and vakhpus? But that might not be direct. I need to be careful with the \"is\" meaning belonging to category.\n\nPerhaps I should think in terms of sets or categories. \"A is B\" means A is a subset of B or A is an instance of B. But since multiple things can be B, it might be that B is a category containing A.\n\nMy goal is to see if x is babbpus. So I need to see if x is in the category babbpus.\n\nx is kolgpus and cudypus. But I don't know what cudypus is. Looking through the information, I don't see cudypus mentioned anywhere else. That might be a problem. Let me check all the given statements.\n\nI have: yorvpus is yortpus. zumtpus is pemjpus and pafbpus. bumfpus is pulmpus and nevmpus. culqpus is hesbpus and nijlpus. tarrpus is pajwpus and kewfpus. lucfpus is tasmpus and rojhpus. kolgpus is kinkpus. toqnpus is duhspus. bescpus is noczpus. tixspus is zoxnpus. nucrpus is mizwpus. rabwpus is bumfpus. pemjpus is yokppus. vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus. najkpus is rabwpus. yortpus is lucfpus and debnpus. noswpus is zuxnpus and pekzpus and wehzpus. cefnpus is rifypus. pesspus is tarrpus. xujppus is cefnpus and bonrpus. mizwpus is kivhpus. wuyspus is mupdpus and sahbpus. nutcpus is bicwpus. yesmpus is pesspus. woklpus is luqmpus and piwspus. ketwpus is qusmpus. hiwhpus is nucrpus and luykpus. hesbpus is babbpus. tasmpus is hijnpus. yokppus is yevjpus and caztpus. fatdpus is zumtpus. zuxnpus is yijwpus and rokwpus. yevjpus is bescpus. dijmpus is morppus and mojkpus and zavkpus and jucnpus. bicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus. bikzpus is ketwpus. kivhpus is dijmpus and qahgpus. nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus. qapkpus is vigwpus. hesbpus is lodmpus. vuktpus is toqnpus and yakkpus. x is kolgpus and cudypus. kinkpus is sexmpus and wocjpus. kolgpus is bidjpus. damrpus is yeclpus. luqmpus is noswpus and yumtpus. damrpus is qapkpus. qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus. sexmpus is hiwhpus and cizcpus and jitnpus. yijwpus is yorvpus. mupdpus is woklpus. hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus. morppus is yesmpus. pajwpus is tixspus. zoxnpus is xuznpus and hiprpus. nutcpus is najkpus. noczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus. xuznpus is xujppus. rifypus is vuktpus. duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus.\n\nI don't see cudypus anywhere else. So for x, we have x is kolgpus and cudypus. But since cudypus is not defined, I might not be able to trace it. However, the question is about x is babbpus, so perhaps through kolgpus, we can find a path, but kolgpus might not be related to babbpus.\n\nLet me try to find a path from kolgpus to babbpus.\n\nFirst, kolgpus is kinkpus. And kinkpus is sexmpus and wocjpus. And sexmpus is hiwhpus and cizcpus and jitnpus. hiwhpus is nucrpus and luykpus. nucrpus is mizwpus. mizwpus is kivhpus. kivhpus is dijmpus and qahgpus. dijmpus is morppus and mojkpus and zavkpus and jucnpus. morppus is yesmpus. yesmpus is pesspus. pesspus is tarrpus. tarrpus is pajwpus and kewfpus. pajwpus is tixspus. tixspus is zoxnpus. zoxnpus is xuznpus and hiprpus. xuznpus is xujppus. xujppus is cefnpus and bonrpus. cefnpus is rifypus. rifypus is vuktpus. vuktpus is toqnpus and yakkpus. toqnpus is duhspus. duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus. nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus. damrpus is yeclpus? Also, damrpus is qapkpus? From above: damrpus is yeclpus and also damrpus is qapkpus? Let's see: from \"damrpus is yeclpus\" and then \"damrpus is qapkpus\"? But that might mean damrpus belongs to yeclpus and also to qapkpus, but that could be multiple categories.\n\nAlso, from \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\" and \"duhspus is nesspus and ...\" so duhspus includes nesspus, which includes damrpus.\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus. babbpus is related to hesbpus. hesbpus is babbpus. And hesbpus is part of culqpus. culqpus is hesbpus and nijlpus. And bicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus. And nutcpus is bicwpus. And noczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus. And bescpus is noczpus. And yevjpus is bescpus. And yokppus is yevjpus and caztpus. And pemjpus is yokppus. And zumtpus is pemjpus and pafbpus. And fatdpus is zumtpus. And hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus. And tasmpus is hijnpus. And lucfpus is tasmpus and rojhpus. And yortpus is lucfpus and debnpus. And yorvpus is yortpus. And yijwpus is yorvpus. And zuxnpus is yijwpus and rokwpus. And noswpus is zuxnpus and pekzpus and wehzpus. And luqmpus is noswpus and yumtpus. And woklpus is luqmpus and piwspus. And mupdpus is woklpus. And wuyspus is mupdpus and sahbpus. And vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus. And qapkpus is vigwpus. And damrpus is qapkpus? From above: damrpus is qapkpus? But also damrpus is yeclpus? And from nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus, so damrpus is part of nesspus.\n\nBut this seems very convoluted, and I don't see any connection from kolgpus to babbpus. kolgpus is going down a different path towards duhspus and nesspus, but babbpus is from hesbpus, which is from culqpus, which is from bicwpus, etc., and that path seems separate.\n\nPerhaps through some common point? But from the chains, I don't see overlap.\n\nWhat about cudypus? Since x is also cudypus, and if cudypus is related to babbpus, but cudypus is not defined anywhere, so I have no information about cudypus. Therefore, I cannot conclude that x is babbpus based on kolgpus alone, and since cudypus is unknown, it might be that cudypus is babbpus, but I don't know.\n\nThe question is whether x is babbpus. Since x is kolgpus and cudypus, for x to be babbpus, both kolgpus and cudypus must be babbpus, or perhaps x is a category that includes babbpus, but from \"x is kolgpus and cudypus\", it means x belongs to kolgpus and to cudypus, so x is an instance of both, but for x to be babbpus, it must be that x is in the set babbpus.\n\nBut since I don't know what cudypus is, I can't say that x is babbpus.\n\nPerhaps from the relationships, I can find if kolgpus is babbpus, but from above, kolgpus is kinkpus, which is sexmpus, etc., and that chain doesn't lead to babbpus.\n\nLet me see if there is any connection between the two chains.\n\nNotice that from duhspus, we have nesspus, which has damrpus, and damrpus is qapkpus, and qapkpus is vigwpus, etc., but also from bescpus, we have noczpus, which has nutcpus, which is bicwpus, which is culqpus, which has hesbpus, which is babbpus.\n\nBut kolgpus is on the duhspus side, not on the bescpus side.\n\nUnless through some other relation.\n\nWhat about yijwpus? yijwpus is yorvpus, and yorvpus is yortpus, and yortpus is lucfpus and debnpus, and lucfpus is tasmpus and rojhpus, and tasmpus is hijnpus, and hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus, and fatdpus is zumtpus, and zumtpus is pemjpus and pafbpus, and pemjpus is yokppus, and yokppus is yevjpus and caztpus, and yevjpus is bescpus, and bescpus is noczpus, and noczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus, and nutcpus is bicwpus, and bicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus, and culqpus is hesbpus and nijlpus, and hesbpus is babbpus.\n\nSo from yijwpus, we can get to babbpus. But kolgpus is not directly connected to yijwpus. kolgpus is kinkpus, which is sexmpus, which is hiwhpus, which is nucrpus, which is mizwpus, which is kivhpus, which is dijmpus, which is morppus, which is yesmpus, which is pesspus, which is tarrpus, which is pajwpus, which is tixspus, which is zoxnpus, which is xuznpus, which is xujppus, which is cefnpus, which is rifypus, which is vuktpus, which is toqnpus, which is duhspus, and duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus, and nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus, and damrpus is yeclpus? and also damrpus is qapkpus? from earlier: \"damrpus is qapkpus\" but also \"damrpus is yeclpus\"? Let's see the statements: \"damrpus is yeclpus\" and then \"damrpus is qapkpus\" – this might be that damrpus belongs to yeclpus and also to qapkpus, so yeclpus and qapkpus are categories that include damrpus.\n\nBut from \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\", so damrpus is part of nesspus.\n\nNow, qapkpus is vigwpus, and vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus, and wuyspus is mupdpus and sahbpus, and mupdpus is woklpus, and woklpus is luqmpus and piwspus, and luqmpus is noswpus and yumtpus, and noswpus is zuxnpus and pekzpus and wehzpus, and zuxnpus is yijwpus and rokwpus, and yijwpus is yorvpus, and from yorvpus we can go to babbpus as above.\n\nSo, from damrpus is qapkpus, and qapkpus is vigwpus, etc., eventually to yijwpus, which leads to babbpus. But damrpus is also part of nesspus, which is part of duhspus, which is from toqnpus, etc., from kolgpus chain.\n\nSo, from kolgpus, we have toqnpus, which is duhspus, which includes nesspus, which includes damrpus, and damrpus is qapkpus, and through qapkpus, we go to vigwpus, to wuyspus, to mupdpus, to woklpus, to luqmpus, to noswpus, to zuxnpus, to yijwpus, to yorvpus, to yortpus, to lucfpus, to tasmpus, to hijnpus, to fatdpus, to zumtpus, to pemjpus, to yokppus, to yevjpus, to bescpus, to noczpus, to nutcpus, to bicwpus, to culqpus, to hesbpus, to babbpus.\n\nSo, theoretically, there is a path from kolgpus to babbpus through this long chain.\n\nBut is this path valid? Let's see the connections step by step.\n\nStart from kolgpus: kolgpus is kinkpus. (from \"kolgpus is kinkpus\")\n\nkinkpus is sexmpus and wocjpus. (from \"kinkpus is sexmpus and wocjpus\")\n\nsexmpus is hiwhpus and cizcpus and jitnpus. (from \"sexmpus is hiwhpus and cizcpus and jitnpus\")\n\nhiwhpus is nucrpus and luykpus. (from \"hiwhpus is nucrpus and luykpus\")\n\nnucrpus is mizwpus. (from \"nucrpus is mizwpus\")\n\nmizwpus is kivhpus. (from \"mizwpus is kivhpus\")\n\nkivhpus is dijmpus and qahgpus. (from \"kivhpus is dijmpus and qahgpus\")\n\ndijmpus is morppus and mojkpus and zavkpus and jucnpus. (from \"dijmpus is morppus and mojkpus and zavkpus and jucnpus\")\n\nmorppus is yesmpus. (from \"morppus is yesmpus\")\n\nyesmpus is pesspus. (from \"yesmpus is pesspus\")\n\npesspus is tarrpus. (from \"pesspus is tarrpus\")\n\ntarrpus is pajwpus and kewfpus. (from \"tarrpus is pajwpus and kewfpus\")\n\npajwpus is tixspus. (from \"pajwpus is tixspus\")\n\ntixspus is zoxnpus. (from \"tixspus is zoxnpus\")\n\nzoxnpus is xuznpus and hiprpus. (from \"zoxnpus is xuznpus and hiprpus\")\n\nxuznpus is xujppus. (from \"xuznpus is xujppus\")\n\nxujppus is cefnpus and bonrpus. (from \"xujppus is cefnpus and bonrpus\")\n\ncefnpus is rifypus. (from \"cefnpus is rifypus\")\n\nrifypus is vuktpus. (from \"rifypus is vuktpus\")\n\nvuktpus is toqnpus and yakkpus. (from \"vuktpus is toqnpus and yakkpus\")\n\ntoqnpus is duhspus. (from \"toqnpus is duhspus\")\n\nduhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus. (from \"duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus\")\n\nnesspus is damrpus and cojzpus. (from \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\")\n\nSo from nesspus, we have damrpus.\n\nNow, damrpus is mentioned in other places. From the information: \"damrpus is yeclpus\" and \"damrpus is qapkpus\". So damrpus belongs to yeclpus and also to qapkpus.\n\nWe need to go to babbpus, so we use damrpus is qapkpus.\n\nqapkpus is vigwpus. (from \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" – wait, is that stated? Let's see: from \"qapkpus is vigwpus\"? I think I have it. From the list: \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" – yes, from \"qapkpus is vigwpus\"?\nLooking back: I have \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" in the list? Let's find: from the given information: \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" – I don't see it directly. Let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the given: \"vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus.\" and then \"qapkpus is vigwpus\"? No, I think I missed it. Let's scan the information.\n\nI see: \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" is not explicitly stated. Instead, I have: \"qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus.\" and also \"damrpus is qapkpus\" but that doesn't say qapkpus is vigwpus.\n\nWhere is qapkpus related to vigwpus? From earlier, I thought from \"damrpus is qapkpus\" and then qapkpus is something, but let's see the chain.\n\nI have: \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\" and \"duhspus is nesspus and ...\" so damrpus is part of nesspus.\n\nBut from other statements: \"damrpus is qapkpus\" – this means damrpus belongs to qapkpus, so qapkpus is a category that contains damrpus.\n\nAlso, \"qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus\" – so qapkpus belongs to bikzpus and budzpus.\n\nBut for going to vigwpus, I need to see if qapkpus is related to vigwpus.\n\nFrom the information: \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" is not stated. Instead, I have: \"vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus\" and \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" is not there.\n\nBut I also have: \"damrpus is yeclpus\" and \"damrpus is qapkpus\" but that doesn't help.\n\nAnother statement: \"qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus\" and \"bikzpus is ketwpus\" and \"ketwpus is qusmpus\" which doesn't lead to vigwpus.\n\nHow did I think that qapkpus is vigwpus? I think I confused it with something else.\n\nLet's list all statements involving qapkpus.\n\nFrom the given:\n\n- qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus.  (from \"qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus\")\n\n- damrpus is qapkpus.  (from \"damrpus is qapkpus\")\n\nAlso, from earlier: \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\" so damrpus is in nesspus.\n\nBut where is vigwpus? vigwpus is mentioned in: \"vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus\" and also \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" is not stated.\n\nBut I also have: \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" is not in the list. Let's read the initial information again.\n\nI see: \"qapkpus is vigwpus\" is not there. Instead, I have: \" yesmpus is pesspus. woklpus is luqmpus and piwspus. ketwpus is qusmpus. hiwhpus is nucrpus and luykpus. hesbpus is babbpus. tasmpus is hijnpus. yokppus is yevjpus and caztpus. fatdpus is zumtpus. zuxnpus is yijwpus and rokwpus. yevjpus is bescpus. dijmpus is morppus and mojkpus and zavkpus and jucnpus. bicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus. bikzpus is ketwpus. kivhpus is dijmpus and qahgpus. nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus. qapkpus is vigwpus. hesbpus is lodmpus. vuktpus is toqnpus and yakkpus. x is kolgpus and cudypus. kinkpus is sexmpus and wocjpus. kolgpus is bidjpus. damrpus is yeclpus. luqmpus is noswpus and yumtpus. damrpus is qapkpus. qapkpus is bikzpus and budzpus. sexmpus is hiwhpus and cizcpus and jitnpus. yijwpus is yorvpus. mupdpus is woklpus. hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus. morppus is yesmpus. pajwpus is tixspus. zoxnpus is xuznpus and hiprpus. nutcpus is najkpus. noczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus. xuznpus is xujppus. rifypus is vuktpus. duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus.\"\n\nWait! I missed it: in the list, after \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus.\" there is \"qapkpus is vigwpus.\" Yes! It is there: \"qapkpus is vigwpus.\" So yes, qapkpus is vigwpus.\n\nSo, from damrpus is qapkpus, and qapkpus is vigwpus, so damrpus is vigwpus? But since damrpus is qapkpus and qapkpus is vigwpus, it means damrpus belongs to qapkpus, and qapkpus belongs to vigwpus, so damrpus is also in vigwpus? But careful: \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if damrpus is qapkpus, that means damrpus is a member of qapkpus category, and qapkpus is vigwpus, meaning qapkpus is a member of vigwpus category, so damrpus is a member of vigwpus category? Not necessarily directly, but through membership: if A is B and B is C, then A is C? In set terms, if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C, then A ⊆ C. But here \"is\" might mean \"is a subset of\" or \"is an instance of\". Typically in such problems, if A is B and B is C, then A is C. So I think we can infer that damrpus is vigwpus.\n\nSimilarly, from the chain, we can continue.\n\nSo, damrpus is vigwpus (since damrpus is qapkpus and qapkpus is vigwpus).\n\nvigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus. (from \"vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is wuyspus and zudkpus? But since vigwpus is wuyspus and zudkpus, it means vigwpus belongs to wuyspus and to zudkpus, so if damrpus is vigwpus, then damrpus is wuyspus and zudkpus.\n\nBut we need to go to wuyspus for the chain.\n\nwuyspus is mupdpus and sahbpus. (from \"wuyspus is mupdpus and sahbpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is mupdpus and sahbpus? Since damrpus is wuyspus, and wuyspus is mupdpus, so damrpus is mupdpus.\n\nSimilarly, mupdpus is woklpus. (from \"mupdpus is woklpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is woklpus.\n\nwoklpus is luqmpus and piwspus. (from \"woklpus is luqmpus and piwspus\")\n\nSo damrpus is luqmpus and piwspus.\n\nluqmpus is noswpus and yumtpus. (from \"luqmpus is noswpus and yumtpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is noswpus and yumtpus.\n\nnoswpus is zuxnpus and pekzpus and wehzpus. (from \"noswpus is zuxnpus and pekzpus and wehzpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is zuxnpus and pekzpus and wehzpus.\n\nzuxnpus is yijwpus and rokwpus. (from \"zuxnpus is yijwpus and rokwpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is yijwpus and rokwpus.\n\nyijwpus is yorvpus. (from \"yijwpus is yorvpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is yorvpus.\n\nyorvpus is yortpus. (from \"yorvpus is yortpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is yortpus.\n\nyortpus is lucfpus and debnpus. (from \"yortpus is lucfpus and debnpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is lucfpus and debnpus.\n\nlucfpus is tasmpus and rojhpus. (from \"lucfpus is tasmpus and rojhpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is tasmpus and rojhpus.\n\ntasmpus is hijnpus. (from \"tasmpus is hijnpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is hijnpus.\n\nhijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus. (from \"hijnpus is fatdpus and vakhpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is fatdpus and vakhpus.\n\nfatdpus is zumtpus. (from \"fatdpus is zumtpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is zumtpus.\n\nzumtpus is pemjpus and pafbpus. (from \"zumtpus is pemjpus and pafbpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is pemjpus and pafbpus.\n\npemjpus is yokppus. (from \"pemjpus is yokppus\")\n\nSo damrpus is yokppus.\n\nyokppus is yevjpus and caztpus. (from \"yokppus is yevjpus and caztpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is yevjpus and caztpus.\n\nyevjpus is bescpus. (from \"yevjpus is bescpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is bescpus.\n\nbescpus is noczpus. (from \"bescpus is noczpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is noczpus.\n\nnoczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus. (from \"noczpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is nutcpus and sipspus and dibxpus.\n\nnutcpus is bicwpus. (from \"nutcpus is bicwpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is bicwpus.\n\nbicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus. (from \"bicwpus is culqpus and nenxpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is culqpus and nenxpus.\n\nculqpus is hesbpus and nijlpus. (from \"culqpus is hesbpus and nijlpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is hesbpus and nijlpus.\n\nhesbpus is babbpus. (from \"hesbpus is babbpus\")\n\nSo damrpus is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, damrpus is babbpus.\n\nNow, recall that from the kolgpus chain, we have that nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus, so damrpus is part of nesspus.\n\nAnd from kolgpus, we went through to duhspus, which is nesspus, so duhspus includes nesspus, which includes damrpus.\n\nBut we need to see if kolgpus itself is babbpus. From the chain, kolgpus leads to damrpus, and damrpus is babbpus, but does that mean kolgpus is babbpus?\n\nLet's see the path: from kolgpus is kinkpus, and so on, up to duhspus is nesspus, and nesspus is damrpus, so duhspus contains damrpus. But kolgpus is not necessarily damrpus; rather, kolgpus is connected to duhspus, which contains damrpus.\n\nBut for kolgpus to be babbpus, we need kolgpus to be a subset of babbpus or an instance of babbpus.\n\nFrom the relationships, since kolgpus is kinkpus, and kinkpus is sexmpus, etc., and eventually, through the chain, we have that duhspus contains nesspus, which contains damrpus, and damrpus is babbpus.\n\nBut does that imply that kolgpus is babbpus? Not directly. Because kolgpus may be a category that includes duhspus, but from the \"is\" statements, we have that kolgpus is kinkpus, meaning kolgpus belongs to kinkpus, so kolgpus is a member of kinkpus. Similarly, kinkpus is a member of sexmpus, and so on. So, following the chain, since each \"is\" indicates membership, we can infer that kolgpus is a member of each subsequent category.\n\nSpecifically, from kolgpus is kinkpus, and kinkpus is sexmpus, so kolgpus is sexmpus. Similarly, kolgpus is hiwhpus, and so on, all the way to kolgpus is duhspus? Let's see.\n\nFrom toqnpus is duhspus, and vuktpus is toqnpus, and rifypus is vuktpus, and cefnpus is rifypus, and xujppus is cefnpus, and xuznpus is xujppus, and zoxnpus is xuznpus, and tixspus is zoxnpus, and pajwpus is tixspus, and tarrpus is pajwpus, and pesspus is tarrpus, and yesmpus is pesspus, and morppus is yesmpus, and dijmpus is morppus, and kivhpus is dijmpus, and mizwpus is kivhpus, and nucrpus is mizwpus, and hiwhpus is nucrpus, and sexmpus is hiwhpus, and kinkpus is sexmpus, and kolgpus is kinkpus.\n\nSo, since kolgpus is kinkpus, and kinkpus is sexmpus, so kolgpus is sexmpus. Similarly, kolgpus is hiwhpus (since sexmpus is hiwhpus), and so on, up to kolgpus is duhspus? Let's see the step to duhspus.\n\nWe have duhspus is related to toqnpus. toqnpus is duhspus? From \"toqnpus is duhspus\", so toqnpus belongs to duhspus.\n\nBut from the chain, we have vuktpus is toqnpus, so vuktpus is toqnpus, and since toqnpus is duhspus, so vuktpus is duhspus.\n\nSimilarly, rifypus is vuktpus, so rifypus is duhspus.\n\ncefnpus is rifypus, so cefnpus is duhspus.\n\nxujppus is cefnpus, so xujppus is duhspus.\n\nxuznpus is xujppus, so xuznpus is duhspus.\n\nzoxnpus is xuznpus, so zoxnpus is duhspus.\n\ntixspus is zoxnpus, so tixspus is duhspus.\n\npajwpus is tixspus, so pajwpus is duhspus.\n\ntarrpus is pajwpus, so tarrpus is duhspus.\n\npesspus is tarrpus, so pesspus is duhspus.\n\nyesmpus is pesspus, so yesmpus is duhspus.\n\nmorppus is yesmpus, so morppus is duhspus.\n\ndijmpus is morppus, so dijmpus is duhspus.\n\nkivhpus is dijmpus, so kivhpus is duhspus.\n\nmizwpus is kivhpus, so mizwpus is duhspus.\n\nnucrpus is mizwpus, so nucrpus is duhspus.\n\nhiwhpus is nucrpus, so hiwhpus is duhspus.\n\nsexmpus is hiwhpus, so sexmpus is duhspus.\n\nkinkpus is sexmpus, so kinkpus is duhspus.\n\nkolgpus is kinkpus, so kolgpus is duhspus.\n\nTherefore, kolgpus is duhspus.\n\nNow, duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus. So duhspus belongs to nesspus, etc. But since duhspus is nesspus, meaning duhspus is a member of nesspus? From \"duhspus is nesspus and ...\" it means duhspus belongs to nesspus and to mehgpus, etc.\n\nSo, since kolgpus is duhspus, and duhspus is nesspus, so kolgpus is nesspus.\n\nnesspus is damrpus and cojzpus. So nesspus belongs to damrpus? No: from \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\", it means that nesspus is a member of damrpus and cojzpus? That would be unusual because typically, if A is B, it means A is contained in B, but here \"nesspus is damrpus\" might mean that nesspus is a subset of damrpus or that damrpus contains nesspus.\n\nLet's think about the meaning. The note says: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \", so it could be that A is a subset of B or A is an instance of B. But in most logic, if A is B, it means B is a category and A is in B.\n\nBut when we have \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\", it means that nesspus belongs to both damrpus and cojzpus categories. So damrpus is a category that contains nesspus.\n\nSimilarly, from earlier, we have damrpus is babbpus, meaning damrpus belongs to babbpus category.\n\nBut for kolgpus to be babbpus, we need kolgpus to be in babbpus category.\n\nWe have kolgpus is nesspus (since kolgpus is duhspus and duhspus is nesspus, so kolgpus is nesspus).\n\nAnd nesspus is damrpus (since nesspus belongs to damrpus category).\n\nSo kolgpus is damrpus? Because if kolgpus is nesspus and nesspus is damrpus, then kolgpus is damrpus.\n\nThen, since damrpus is babbpus, so kolgpus is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, kolgpus is babbpus.\n\nNow, x is kolgpus and cudypus. So since x is kolgpus, and kolgpus is babbpus, then x is babbpus.\n\nWe don't even need cudypus for this conclusion.\n\nSo, it seems that x is babbpus.\n\nBut let's confirm the steps.\n\nWe have kolgpus is kinkpus, and through the chain, we derived kolgpus is duhspus.\n\nduhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus. So duhspus is nesspus, meaning duhspus belongs to nesspus category.\n\nThus, since kolgpus is duhspus, so kolgpus is nesspus.\n\nnesspus is damrpus and cojzpus, so nesspus belongs to damrpus category.\n\nThus, kolgpus is damrpus? Yes, because kolgpus is nesspus and nesspus is damrpus, so kolgpus is damrpus.\n\nThen, from earlier, we have damrpus is babbpus (as derived from damrpus is qapkpus, qapkpus is vigwpus, etc., up to damrpus is hesbpus, and hesbpus is babbpus).\n\nSo damrpus is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, kolgpus is babbpus.\n\nSince x is kolgpus, x is babbpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut the question is: \"Is it true or false or unknown: x is babbpus?\"\n\nBased on this, it is true.\n\nI should ensure that all steps are valid.\n\nOne potential issue: in the chain from damrpus to babbpus, we used damrpus is qapkpus, but damrpus is also yeclpus, but that doesn't affect the reasoning.\n\nAlso, from kolgpus to damrpus, we used that nesspus is damrpus, which is from \"nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus\", so that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus.\n\nSo, the answer is true.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nkolgpus is kinkpus, which is sexmpus, which is hiwhpus, which is nucrpus, which is mizwpus, which is kivhpus, which is dijmpus, which is morppus, which is yesmpus, which is pesspus, which is tarrpus, which is pajwpus, which is tixspus, which is zoxnpus, which is xuznpus, which is xujppus, which is cefnpus, which is rifypus, which is vuktpus, which is toqnpus, which is duhspus, and duhspus is nesspus and mehgpus and penkpus and kazrpus, and nesspus is damrpus and cojzpus, and damrpus is yeclpus?\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

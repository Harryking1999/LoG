  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus. From the given information, I see that x is defined as xepkpus and rawkpus. But I don't see rawkpus mentioned anywhere else, so I might need to focus on xepkpus.\n\nLooking at the information: \"x is xepkpus and rawkpus.\" But since rawkpus isn't defined anywhere, I should probably ignore it for now or assume that x is primarily xepkpus. The question is about x being babbpus, so I need to see if xepkpus is connected to babbpus.\n\nNow, babbpus is mentioned in the context of hajbpus: \"hajbpus is babbpus and gaqlpus.\" So hajbpus contains babbpus. But I need to see if x is related to hajbpus.\n\nI also have: \"yenwpus is hatspus.\" and \"hatspus is hajbpus.\" So yenwpus is hatspus, and hatspus is hajbpus, so yenwpus is hajbpus indirectly.\n\nBut I need to connect x to hajbpus. x is xepkpus, so let's see what xepkpus is.\n\nFrom the information: \"xepkpus is vejnpus and lowypus.\"\n\nvejnpus is hovppus: \"vejnpus is hovppus.\"\n\nhovppus is puyrpus and qapspus: \"hovppus is puyrpus and qapspus.\"\n\npuyrpus is socnpus and sorppus: \"puyrpus is socnpus and sorppus.\"\n\nsocnpus is renbpus: \"socnpus is renbpus.\"\n\nrenbpus is zowzpus: \"renbpus is zowzpus.\"\n\nzowzpus is palypus: \"zowzpus is palypus.\" and also \"zowzpus is rotcpus.\" But since it's \"is\" meaning belongs to, zowzpus might be in multiple categories, but probably we need to see the chain.\n\nzowzpus is also rotcpus? Let's see: \"zowzpus is rotcpus.\" But earlier, renbpus is zowzpus, and socnpus is renbpus, so socnpus is zowzpus, and puyrpus is socnpus, so puyrpus is zowzpus, and so on.\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus, which is under hajbpus.\n\nhajbpus is also mentioned in yenwpus: \"yenwpus is hatspus\" and \"hatspus is hajbpus\", so yenwpus is hajbpus.\n\nBut is xepkpus connected to yenwpus? xepkpus is vejnpus and lowypus, and vejnpus is hovppus, which is puyrpus, etc. This seems to be going in a different direction.\n\nI recall that x is also rawkpus, but since rawkpus isn't defined, I might need to consider other paths.\n\nPerhaps I should look for babbpus directly. babbpus is part of hajbpus, and hajbpus is also tokfpus and juqlpus, but that might not help.\n\nAnother thing: \"hajbpus is babbpus and gaqlpus.\" So to have x is babbpus, x must be part of hajbpus or something.\n\nBut x is xepkpus, so I need to see if xepkpus is hajbpus or connected.\n\nLet's list all the relationships step by step.\n\nI am considering starting from xepkpus and tracing upwards or downwards to see if it links to hajbpus.\n\nxepkpus is vejnpus and lowypus.\n\nvejnpus is hovppus.\n\nhovppus is puyrpus and qapspus.\n\npuyrpus is socnpus and sorppus.\n\nsocnpus is renbpus.\n\nrenbpus is zowzpus.\n\nzowzpus is palypus. (from \"zowzpus is palypus\")\n\nBut also \"zowzpus is rotcpus\" – so zowzpus belongs to rotcpus? Or is it that rotcpus contains zowzpus? The meaning is \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so B is a category containing A.\n\nSo for example, \"zowzpus is palypus\" means zowzpus is in the category palypus.\n\nSimilarly, \"zowzpus is rotcpus\" means zowzpus is also in the category rotcpus.\n\nBut for our purpose, we need to see if xepkpus is babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is a category, and we need to see if xepkpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nSince babbpus is contained in hajbpus, perhaps we need to see if xepkpus is in hajbpus.\n\nBut hajbpus is a category that contains babbpus and gaqlpus, so if xepkpus is in hajbpus, it might be either babbpus or gaqlpus, but we need specifically babbpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus?\" meaning is x in the category babbpus.\n\nSo from the chains, I need to find if xepkpus leads to babbpus.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I should look for where babbpus is used or defined.\n\nbabbpus is only mentioned in \"hajbpus is babbpus and gaqlpus.\" So hajbpus has subcategories babbpus and gaqlpus.\n\nBut hajbpus itself is mentioned in \"hatspus is hajbpus\" and \"yenwpus is hatspus\", so yenwpus is hajbpus.\n\nAlso, \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" from \"xegcpus is ninhpus\" but wait, let's see.\n\nI have \"xegcpus is ninhpus\" and \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" from \"xegcpus is ninhpus\" and later \"ninhpus is yenwpus\"? Let's check the text.\n\nFrom the given information: \"xegcpus is peknpus.\" and \"xegcpus is ninhpus.\" so xegcpus is both peknpus and ninhpus? That might mean xegcpus belongs to both categories.\n\nThen \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" – is that stated? Let's see: I don't see \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" directly. Let's read carefully.\n\nI see: \"yenwpus is hatspus.\" and \"hatspus is hajbpus.\" but no direct link from ninhpus to yenwpus.\n\nWait, I think I missed something. Let's list all statements involving ninhpus.\n\nFrom the text: \"xegcpus is peknpus.\" and \"xegcpus is ninhpus.\" so xegcpus is ninhpus.\n\nThen, later: \"covtpus is xegcpus and lacnpus.\" so covtpus contains xegcpus.\n\nBut where is ninhpus defined? I don't see \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" in the text. Let's scan the text.\n\nThe text says: \"xegcpus is ninhpus.\" but that means xegcpus is in ninhpus, so ninhpus is a category containing xegcpus.\n\nThen, is there any statement about ninhpus? I see: \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" is not present. Instead, I see \"yenwpus is hatspus\" and so on.\n\nPerhaps I need to find from other places.\n\nAnother thing: \"x is xepkpus and rawkpus\" but rawkpus is not defined, so maybe rawkpus is irrelevant, or perhaps it's a typo, but I have to work with what is given.\n\nPerhaps x is both xepkpus and rawkpus, but since rawkpus is not defined, I can't use it, so I focus on xepkpus.\n\nNow, back to babbpus. hajbpus contains babbpus, and hajbpus is also contained in hatspus and yenwpus.\n\nBut how to connect to xepkpus?\n\nLet's list all statements from the beginning that might connect to xepkpus.\n\nxepkpus is vejnpus and lowypus.\n\nvejnpus is hovppus.\n\nhovppus is puyrpus and qapspus.\n\npuyrpus is socnpus and sorppus.\n\nsocnpus is renbpus.\n\nrenbpus is zowzpus.\n\nzowzpus is palypus. and zowzpus is rotcpus.\n\nrotcpus is qawgpus. from \"rotcpus is qawgpus\"?\n\nLet's see: \"rotcpus is qawgpus\" is stated? Yes, from the text: \"rotcpus is qawgpus.\"\n\nqawgpus is xevlpus. from \"qawgpus is xevlpus.\"\n\nxevlpus is werxpus. from \"xevlpus is werxpus.\"\n\nwerxpus is zonspus. from \"werxpus is zonspus.\"\n\nzonspus is fujwpus. from \"zonspus is fujwpus.\"\n\nfujwpus is beffpus. from \"fujwpus is beffpus.\"\n\nbeffpus is jexcpus. from \"beffpus is jexcpus.\"\n\njexcpus is vawlpus. from \"jexcpus is vawlpus.\"\n\nvawlpus is naygpus. from \"vawlpus is naygpus.\"\n\nnaygpus is curbpus. from \"naygpus is curbpus.\"\n\ncurbpus is wannpus and kalrpus. from \"curbpus is wannpus and kalrpus.\"\n\nwannpus is remlpus. from \"wannpus is remlpus.\"\n\nremlpus is bovfpus. from \"remlpus is bovfpus.\"\n\nbovfpus is joqypus and yuzzpus. from \"bovfpus is joqypus and yuzzpus.\"\n\njoqypus is zifwpus. from \"joqypus is zifwpus.\"\n\nzifwpus is lecmpus. from \"zifwpus is lecmpus.\"\n\nlecmpus is zelkpus. from \"lecmpus is zelkpus.\"\n\nzelkpus is pukhpus and vodxpus. from \"zelkpus is pukhpus and vodxpus.\"\n\npukhpus is wismpus and lutppus. from \"pukhpus is wismpus and lutppus.\"\n\nwismpus is kubcpus. from \"wismpus is kubcpus.\" and also \"wismpus is nabdpus\" from earlier, but since it is kubcpus, probably kubcpus is a category containing wismpus.\n\nkubcpus is sijzpus. from \"kubcpus is sijzpus.\"\n\nsijzpus is vonxpus. from \"sijzpus is vonxpus.\"\n\nvonxpus is vegfpus. from \"vonxpus is vegfpus.\" and also \"vonxpus is riplpus\" from \"vonxpus is riplpus\" but let's see.\n\nvegfpus is hexmpus and sorvpus. from \"vegfpus is hexmpus and sorvpus.\"\n\nhexmpus is sixhpus and zitrpus and tiwppus. from \"hexmpus is sixhpus and zitrpus and tiwppus.\"\n\nsixhpus is nuqbpus. from \"sixhpus is nuqbpus.\"\n\nnuqbpus is goncpus and zamfpus. from \"nuqbpus is goncpus and zamfpus.\"\n\ngoncpus is qawlpus. from \"goncpus is qawlpus.\"\n\nqawlpus is toztpus. from \"qawlpus is toztpus.\"\n\ntoztpus is fupcpus and caxvpus and yekzpus. from \"toztpus is fupcpus and caxvpus and yekzpus.\"\n\nfupcpus is filfpus. from \"fupcpus is filfpus.\"\n\nfilfpus is lijcpus and yosfpus. from \"filfpus is lijcpus and yosfpus.\"\n\nlijcpus is heqhpus. from \"lijcpus is heqhpus.\"\n\nheqhpus is mudzpus and ziqrpus. from \"heqhpus is mudzpus and ziqrpus.\"\n\nmudzpus is gipfpus. from \"mudzpus is gipfpus.\"\n\ngipfpus is sowcpus and jamwpus. from \"gipfpus is sowcpus and jamwpus.\"\n\nsowcpus is yuqtpus. from \"sowcpus is yuqtpus.\"\n\nyuqtpus is disdpus. from \"yuqtpus is disdpus.\"\n\ndisdpus is daljpus and qujkpus. from \"disdpus is daljpus and qujkpus.\"\n\ndaljpus is kamkpus. from \"daljpus is kamkpus.\"\n\nkamkpus is wuxmpus. from \"kamkpus is wuxmpus.\"\n\nwuxmpus is quxcpus and cotqpus. from \"wuxmpus is quxcpus and cotqpus.\"\n\nquxcpus is zikvpus. from \"quxcpus is zikvpus.\"\n\nzikvpus is foqrpus and xijfpus. from \"zikvpus is foqrpus and xijfpus.\"\n\nfoqrpus is simbpus. from \"foqrpus is simbpus.\"\n\nsimbpus is pijkpus. from \"simbpus is pijkpus.\"\n\npijkpus is vindpus and fizxpus and pelypus. from \"pijkpus is vindpus and fizxpus and pelypus.\"\n\nvindpus is bakwpus. from \"vindpus is bakwpus.\"\n\nbakwpus is puscpus. from \"bakwpus is puscpus.\"\n\npuscpus is puykpus and zeqppus and lomfpus. from \"puscpus is puykpus and zeqppus and lomfpus.\"\n\npuykpus is mocfpus. from \"puykpus is mocfpus.\" and also \"puykpus is covtpus\" from earlier? Let's see: \"puykpus is covtpus\" is stated? From the text: \"puykpus is covtpus\" yes, from \"puykpus is covtpus.\"\n\ncovtpus is xegcpus and lacnpus. from \"covtpus is xegcpus and lacnpus.\"\n\nxegcpus is peknpus and ninhpus. from \"xegcpus is peknpus\" and \"xegcpus is ninhpus\".\n\npeknpus is cefvpus. from \"peknpus is cefvpus.\"\n\ncefvpus is kuwzpus and bakxpus. from \"cefvpus is kuwzpus and bakxpus.\"\n\nkuwzpus is pitypus and pisnpus. from \"kuwzpus is pitypus and pisnpus.\"\n\npitypus is lexwpus and qogypus. from \"pitypus is lexwpus and qogypus.\"\n\nlexwpus is lobhpus. from \"lexwpus is lobhpus.\"\n\nlobhpus is rifmpus and tummpus. from \"lobhpus is rifmpus and tummpus.\"\n\nrifmpus is fudlpus. from \"rifmpus is fudlpus.\"\n\nfudlpus is cokcpus and ruchpus. from \"fudlpus is cokcpus and ruchpus.\"\n\nThis is a very long chain, and I seem to be going away from babbpus.\n\nI need to find hajbpus. hajbpus is under hatspus and yenwpus.\n\nyenwpus is hatspus, so yenwpus is hajbpus.\n\nNow, where is yenwpus mentioned? From the text, I have \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" but is that true? Let's check the text.\n\nIn the given information, I see: \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" is not directly stated. Instead, I see \"xegcpus is ninhpus\" and then \"yenwpus is hatspus\" etc.\n\nBut I also have \"covtpus is xegcpus and lacnpus\" and \"puykpus is covtpus\" and \"puykpus is mocfpus\" etc.\n\nBut let's look for yenwpus directly.\n\nFrom the text: \"yenwpus is hatspus.\" and \"hatspus is hajbpus.\" so yenwpus is hajbpus.\n\nNow, is there any connection from xepkpus to yenwpus?\n\nxepkpus is vejnpus and lowypus. lowypus is not defined, so let's see if lowypus is connected.\n\nPerhaps from other chains.\n\nAnother statement: \"xepkpus is vejnpus and lowypus\" and vejnpus is hovppus, etc., but that doesn't lead to yenwpus.\n\nPerhaps from the other side, but I need to find if xepkpus is in hajbpus.\n\nNotice that hajbpus is also mentioned in \"hajbpus is tokfpus and juqlpus\" but that doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps from the chain involving yenwpus.\n\nHow is yenwpus related to other things? I see that \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" is not stated, but let's read the text carefully.\n\nIn the text, there is: \"xegcpus is peknpus.\" and \"xegcpus is ninhpus.\" and then later, \"covtpus is xegcpus and lacnpus.\" and \"puykpus is covtpus.\" and \"puykpus is mocfpus.\" and \"mocfpus is judbpus.\" and \"judbpus is vewmpus.\" and \"vewmpus is cuzfpus.\" etc., but no yenwpus.\n\nBut then, I see: \"yenwpus is hatspus.\" and \"hatspus is hajbpus.\" so yenwpus is hajbpus.\n\nNow, is there any link from xegcpus to yenwpus? From \"xegcpus is ninhpus\" and if ninhpus is yenwpus, then xegcpus is yenwpus, but is ninhpus yenwpus?\n\nLet's look at the text: after \"xegcpus is ninhpus\" there is no \"ninhpus is yenwpus\". Instead, there is \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" missing.\n\nPerhaps I misread. Let's list all statements from the text in order.\n\nThe text says: \"foqrpus is simbpus. rifmpus is fudlpus. vejnpus is hovppus. fupcpus is filfpus. renbpus is zowzpus. kamkpus is wuxmpus. wismpus is nabdpus. sowcpus is yuqtpus. quxcpus is zikvpus. heqhpus is mudzpus and ziqrpus. kuwzpus is pitypus and pisnpus. wismpus is kubcpus. disdpus is daljpus and qujkpus. palypus is muzfpus. pitypus is lexwpus and qogypus. xepkpus is vejnpus and lowypus. filfpus is lijcpus and yosfpus. zowzpus is palypus. vewmpus is cuzfpus. werxpus is zonspus. xevlpus is werxpus. hatspus is hajbpus. zonspus is fujwpus. puyrpus is socnpus and sorppus. cefvpus is kuwzpus and bakxpus. rotcpus is qawgpus. judbpus is vewmpus. bovfpus is joqypus and yuzzpus. lijcpus is heqhpus. vawlpus is naygpus. goncpus is qawlpus. naygpus is curbpus. qawgpus is xevlpus. toztpus is fupcpus and caxvpus and yekzpus. vonxpus is vegfpus. zifwpus is lecmpus. lecmpus is zelkpus. gipfpus is sowcpus and jamwpus. lobhpus is rifmpus and tummpus. nuqbpus is goncpus and zamfpus. wannpus is remlpus. hexmpus is sixhpus and zitrpus and tiwppus. mocfpus is judbpus. wuxmpus is quxcpus and cotqpus. yenwpus is hatspus. sixhpus is nuqbpus. xegcpus is peknpus. xegcpus is ninhpus. yuqtpus is disdpus. vegfpus is hexmpus and sorvpus. hovppus is puyrpus and qapspus. beffpus is jexcpus. vonxpus is riplpus. socnpus is renbpus. zowzpus is rotcpus. zelkpus is pukhpus and vodxpus. qawlpus is toztpus. peknpus is cefvpus. vindpus is bakwpus. kubcpus is sijzpus. sijzpus is vonxpus. fudlpus is cokcpus and ruchpus. mudzpus is gipfpus. puykpus is covtpus. joqypus is zifwpus. simbpus is pijkpus. covtpus is xegcpus and lacnpus. puscpus is puykpus and zeqppus and lomfpus. pijkpus is vindpus and fizxpus and pelypus. puykpus is mocfpus. lexwpus is lobhpus. hajbpus is tokfpus and juqlpus. pukhpus is wismpus and lutppus. ninhpus is yenwpus. jexcpus is vawlpus. bakwpus is puscpus. hajbpus is babbpus and gaqlpus. daljpus is kamkpus. curbpus is wannpus and kalrpus. zikvpus is foqrpus and xijfpus. x is xepkpus and rawkpus. fujwpus is beffpus. remlpus is bovfpus. \"\n\nAh!

  "thinking_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus. From the given information, I see that x is defined as xepkpus and rawkpus. But I don't see rawkpus mentioned anywhere else, so I might need to focus on xepkpus.\n\nLooking at the information: \"x is xepkpus and rawkpus.\" But since rawkpus isn't defined anywhere, I should probably ignore it for now or assume that x is primarily xepkpus. The question is about x being babbpus, so I need to see if xepkpus is connected to babbpus.\n\nNow, babbpus is mentioned in the context of hajbpus: \"hajbpus is babbpus and gaqlpus.\" So hajbpus contains babbpus. But I need to see if x is related to hajbpus.\n\nI also have: \"yenwpus is hatspus.\" and \"hatspus is hajbpus.\" So yenwpus is hatspus, and hatspus is hajbpus, so yenwpus is hajbpus indirectly.\n\nBut I need to connect x to hajbpus. x is xepkpus, so let's see what xepkpus is.\n\nFrom the information: \"xepkpus is vejnpus and lowypus.\"\n\nvejnpus is hovppus: \"vejnpus is hovppus.\"\n\nhovppus is puyrpus and qapspus: \"hovppus is puyrpus and qapspus.\"\n\npuyrpus is socnpus and sorppus: \"puyrpus is socnpus and sorppus.\"\n\nsocnpus is renbpus: \"socnpus is renbpus.\"\n\nrenbpus is zowzpus: \"renbpus is zowzpus.\"\n\nzowzpus is palypus: \"zowzpus is palypus.\" and also \"zowzpus is rotcpus.\" But since it's \"is\" meaning belongs to, zowzpus might be in multiple categories, but probably we need to see the chain.\n\nzowzpus is also rotcpus? Let's see: \"zowzpus is rotcpus.\" But earlier, renbpus is zowzpus, and socnpus is renbpus, so socnpus is zowzpus, and puyrpus is socnpus, so puyrpus is zowzpus, and so on.\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus, which is under hajbpus.\n\nhajbpus is also mentioned in yenwpus: \"yenwpus is hatspus\" and \"hatspus is hajbpus\", so yenwpus is hajbpus.\n\nBut is xepkpus connected to yenwpus? xepkpus is vejnpus and lowypus, and vejnpus is hovppus, which is puyrpus, etc. This seems to be going in a different direction.\n\nI recall that x is also rawkpus, but since rawkpus isn't defined, I might need to consider other paths.\n\nPerhaps I should look for babbpus directly. babbpus is part of hajbpus, and hajbpus is also tokfpus and juqlpus, but that might not help.\n\nAnother thing: \"hajbpus is babbpus and gaqlpus.\" So to have x is babbpus, x must be part of hajbpus or something.\n\nBut x is xepkpus, so I need to see if xepkpus is hajbpus or connected.\n\nLet's list all the relationships step by step.\n\nI am considering starting from xepkpus and tracing upwards or downwards to see if it links to hajbpus.\n\nxepkpus is vejnpus and lowypus.\n\nvejnpus is hovppus.\n\nhovppus is puyrpus and qapspus.\n\npuyrpus is socnpus and sorppus.\n\nsocnpus is renbpus.\n\nrenbpus is zowzpus.\n\nzowzpus is palypus. (from \"zowzpus is palypus\")\n\nBut also \"zowzpus is rotcpus\" – so zowzpus belongs to rotcpus? Or is it that rotcpus contains zowzpus? The meaning is \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so B is a category containing A.\n\nSo for example, \"zowzpus is palypus\" means zowzpus is in the category palypus.\n\nSimilarly, \"zowzpus is rotcpus\" means zowzpus is also in the category rotcpus.\n\nBut for our purpose, we need to see if xepkpus is babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is a category, and we need to see if xepkpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nSince babbpus is contained in hajbpus, perhaps we need to see if xepkpus is in hajbpus.\n\nBut hajbpus is a category that contains babbpus and gaqlpus, so if xepkpus is in hajbpus, it might be either babbpus or gaqlpus, but we need specifically babbpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus?\" meaning is x in the category babbpus.\n\nSo from the chains, I need to find if xepkpus leads to babbpus.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I should look for where babbpus is used or defined.\n\nbabbpus is only mentioned in \"hajbpus is babbpus and gaqlpus.\" So hajbpus has subcategories babbpus and gaqlpus.\n\nBut hajbpus itself is mentioned in \"hatspus is hajbpus\" and \"yenwpus is hatspus\", so yenwpus is hajbpus.\n\nAlso, \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" from \"xegcpus is ninhpus\" but wait, let's see.\n\nI have \"xegcpus is ninhpus\" and \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" from \"xegcpus is ninhpus\" and later \"ninhpus is yenwpus\"? Let's check the text.\n\nFrom the given information: \"xegcpus is peknpus.\" and \"xegcpus is ninhpus.\" so xegcpus is both peknpus and ninhpus? That might mean xegcpus belongs to both categories.\n\nThen \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" – is that stated? Let's see: I don't see \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" directly. Let's read carefully.\n\nI see: \"yenwpus is hatspus.\" and \"hatspus is hajbpus.\" but no direct link from ninhpus to yenwpus.\n\nWait, I think I missed something. Let's list all statements involving ninhpus.\n\nFrom the text: \"xegcpus is peknpus.\" and \"xegcpus is ninhpus.\" so xegcpus is ninhpus.\n\nThen, later: \"covtpus is xegcpus and lacnpus.\" so covtpus contains xegcpus.\n\nBut where is ninhpus defined? I don't see \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" in the text. Let's scan the text.\n\nThe text says: \"xegcpus is ninhpus.\" but that means xegcpus is in ninhpus, so ninhpus is a category containing xegcpus.\n\nThen, is there any statement about ninhpus? I see: \"ninhpus is yenwpus\" is not present. Instead, I see \"yenwpus is hatspus\" and so on.\n\nPerhaps I need to find from other places.\n\nAnother thing: \"x is xepkpus and rawkpus\" but rawkpus is not defined, so maybe rawkpus is irrelevant, or perhaps it's a typo, but I have to work with what is given.\n\nPerhaps x is both xepkpus and rawkpus, but since rawkpus is not defined, I can't use it, so I focus on xepkpus.\n\nNow, back to babbpus. hajbpus contains babbpus, and hajbpus is also contained in hatspus and yenwpus.\n\nBut how to connect to xepkpus?\n\nLet's list all statements from the beginning that might connect to xepkpus.\n\nxepkpus is vejnpus and lowypus.\n\nvejnpus is hovppus.\n\nhovppus is puyrpus and qapspus.\n\npuyrpus is socnpus and sorppus.\n\nsocnpus is renbpus.\n\nrenbpus is zowzpus.\n\nzowzpus is palypus. and zowzpus is rotcpus.\n\nrotcpus is qawgpus. from \"rotcpus is qawgpus\"?\n\nLet's see: \"rotcpus is qawgpus\" is stated?

For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, the answer is unknown.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

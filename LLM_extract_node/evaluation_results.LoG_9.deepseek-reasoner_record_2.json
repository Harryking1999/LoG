Since x is caxwpus, I need to see if caxwpus is connected to babbpus.\n\nFrom the information, davfpus is babbpus (among other things). So if I can link caxwpus to davfpus, then x might be babbpus.\n\nLet me start from x: x is caxwpus.\n\ncaxwpus is lajspus and vimgpus. I need to follow one of these paths. Probably lajspus since vimgpus might not be connected directly.\n\nlajspus is wetypus.\n\nwetypus is nuglpus.\n\nnuglpus is xinzpus and dofwpus and herfpus.\n\nxinzpus is nunppus.\n\nnunppus is xakmpus.\n\nxakmpus is luzzpus and logjpus.\n\nluzzpus has many categories: jalfpus, simqpus, fupspus, ditdpus, buqvpus.\n\nbuqvpus is waxzpus.\n\nwaxzpus is nanqpus.\n\nnanqpus is coywpus.\n\ncoywpus is ziswpus.\n\nziswpus is namlpus.\n\nnamlpus is tebnpus.\n\ntebnpus is cehdpus and yazypus and perypus.\n\ncehdpus is wihnpus.\n\nwihnpus is cojcpus and kilzpus.\n\ncojcpus is zerfpus.\n\nzerfpus is wegcpus.\n\nwegcpus is lurfpus.\n\nlurfpus is cethpus.\n\ncethpus is jeqjpus.\n\njeqjpus is xirjpus.\n\nxirjpus is homnpus and lobppus and wavqpus.

From earlier: wozspus is cublpus, and later noddpus is wozspus and restpus, and also wozspus is zepmpus? Let's see: from \"wozspus is cublpus\" and \"noddpus is wozspus and restpus\", but then \"wozspus is zepmpus\" is not directly stated. Wait, I think I missed something.\n\nLooking back: \"wozspus is cublpus\" is given, and then \"noddpus is wozspus and restpus\", but no direct \"wozspus is zepmpus\". However, later in the list, there is \"wozspus is zepmpus\"? Let me check the given information again.\n\nFrom the list: \"wozspus is cublpus.\" and then later \"wozspus is zepmpus.\"? No, in the list I have: \"wozspus is cublpus.\" from earlier, and then at the end, I have \"wozspus is zepmpus.\"? Let's read the given information carefully.\n\nI see: \"wozspus is cublpus.\" is stated. Then later, after \"noddpus is wozspus and restpus\", there is no \"wozspus is zepmpus\" immediately. But in the list, towards the end, I have: \"zerfpus is wegcpus. wozspus is zepmpus. xirjpus is wavqpus.\"\n\nYes! \"wozspus is zepmpus\" is given. So wozspus is both cublpus and zepmpus? But in this context, \"is\" means belongs to category, so wozspus can belong to multiple categories.\n\nSimilarly, cublpus is bixcpus and gixrpus.\n\nBut I need to get to davfpus, which is babbpus.\n\nFrom heghpus, which has noddpus, and noddpus has wozspus, but I need to see if this leads to davfpus.\n\nAnother path: from xirjpus, I have homnpus, which has wiznpus, etc., but I need davfpus.\n\nI recall that yeyppus is davfpus, and rovhpus is yeyppus, and jojwpus is rovhpus, and bixcpus is jojwpus, and cublpus is bixcpus and gixrpus, and wozspus is cublpus, and noddpus is wozspus, etc. But I am coming from the other direction.\n\nSince I have xirjpus from earlier, and xirjpus is homnpus, homnpus is wiznpus, wiznpus is wohjpus, wohjpus is jottpus, jottpus is mehjpus, mehjpus is liqspus, liqspus is leljpus, leljpus is durfpus, durfpus is qismpus, qismpus is vuwlpus, vuwlpus is heghpus, heghpus is noddpus, noddpus is wozspus, wozspus is cublpus, cublpus is bixcpus, bixcpus is jojwpus, jojwpus is rovhpus, rovhpus is yeyppus, yeyppus is davfpus, and davfpus is babbpus.\n\nSo, through this long chain, xirjpus is connected to davfpus.\n\nBut in my path from x, I have jeqjpus is xirjpus, and cethpus is jeqjpus, and lurfpus is cethpus, and wegcpus is lurfpus, and zerfpus is wegcpus, and cojcpus is zerfpus, and wihnpus is cojcpus, and cehdpus is wihnpus, and tebnpus is cehdpus, and namlpus is tebnpus, and ziswpus is namlpus, and coywpus is ziswpus, and nanqpus is coywpus, and waxzpus is nanqpus, and buqvpus is waxzpus, and luzzpus is buqvpus, and xakmpus is luzzpus, and nunppus is xakmpus, and xinzpus is nunppus, and nuglpus is xinzpus, and wetypus is nuglpus, and lajspus is wetypus, and caxwpus is lajspus, and x is caxwpus.\n\nSo from x, we have a path to xirjpus through jeqjpus.\n\nAnd from xirjpus, we have a path to davfpus as above.\n\nTherefore, x is connected to davfpus, and since davfpus is babbpus, x should be babbpus.\n\nBut let's confirm if indeed xirjpus leads to davfpus.\n\nFrom xirjpus, we have multiple categories: homnpus, lobppus, wavqpus. But for the path to davfpus, we use homnpus.\n\nhomnpus is wiznpus and hijnpus.\n\nwiznpus is wohjpus and fovbpus and wojhpus.\n\nwohjpus is jottpus.\n\njottpus is mehjpus.\n\nmehjpus is liqspus.\n\nliqspus is leljpus.\n\nleljpus is durfpus.\n\ndurfpus is qismpus and cignpus and divmpus.\n\nqismpus is vuwlpus.\n\nvuwlpus is heghpus.\n\nheghpus is noddpus and cijzpus and qadxpus.\n\nnoddpus is wozspus and restpus.\n\nwozspus is cublpus (and also zepmpus, but we use cublpus).\n\ncublpus is bixcpus and gixrpus.\n\nbixcpus is jojwpus.\n\njojwpus is rovhpus.\n\nrovhpus is yeyppus.\n\nyeyppus is davfpus.\n\ndavfpus is babbpus and marlpus and hozxpus.\n\nSo yes, xirjpus is connected to davfpus through this chain.\n\nAnd since x is connected to xirjpus, x is connected to davfpus, and thus x is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nBut the question is: is it true or false or unknown? Based on this, it should be true.\n\nI should ensure that there are no contradictions or missing links.\n\nFrom x to xirjpus: we have x -> caxwpus -> lajspus -> wetypus -> nuglpus -> xinzpus -> nunppus -> xakmpus -> luzzpus -> buqvpus -> waxzpus -> nanqpus -> coywpus -> ziswpus -> namlpus -> tebnpus -> cehdpus -> wihnpus -> cojcpus -> zerfpus -> wegcpus -> lurfpus -> cethpus -> jeqjpus -> xirjpus.\n\nThen from xirjpus to davfpus as above.\n\nSo, all links are connected.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

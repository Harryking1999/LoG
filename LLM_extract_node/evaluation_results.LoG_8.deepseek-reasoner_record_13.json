  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is both babbpus and babcpus. From the given information, x is nufrpus. So, I'll start from there.\n\nx is nufrpus.\n\nNow, nufrpus is vukmpus and kufkpus. So, nufrpus contains vukmpus and kufkpus. But since we're dealing with categories, x being nufrpus means x is in the category nufrpus, which includes vukmpus and kufkpus. But for x itself, I need to see what categories x belongs to directly or indirectly.\n\nThe question is about x being babbpus and babcpus, so I need to find if x is in the category babbpus and also in babcpus.\n\nLet me list out all the relationships from the given information. I'll organize them so I can trace the categories.\n\nStart with x: x is nufrpus.\n\nnufrpus is vukmpus and kufkpus. So, x is nufrpus, which means x is also vukmpus and kufkpus? No, according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if nufrpus is vukmpus, that means nufrpus is a subset of vukmpus? Or does it mean that vukmpus is a category that contains nufrpus? I need to clarify the direction.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, if A is B, then A is a member of category B, or A is contained in B. So, for example, if dadypus is heybpus, then dadypus belongs to heybpus category.\n\nSimilarly, if nufrpus is vukmpus, then nufrpus belongs to vukmpus category. So, vukmpus is a broader category that includes nufrpus.\n\nTherefore, if x is nufrpus, and nufrpus is vukmpus, then x is also vukmpus because x is in nufrpus, which is in vukmpus.\n\nSimilarly, nufrpus is kufkpus, so x is also kufkpus.\n\nNow, I need to find if x is babbpus and babcpus.\n\nbabbpus is mentioned in: xorfpus is babbpus and zasspus and ratppus. So xorfpus belongs to babbpus, among others. But I need to see if x is babbpus.\n\nbabcpus is mentioned in: senrpus is babcpus. But senrpus is also xuttpus? Let's see: senrpus is xuttpus, and also senrpus is babcpus? From the given: senrpus is xuttpus. and later senrpus is babcpus. So senrpus belongs to xuttpus and to babcpus? Or is it that senrpus is a category that has xuttpus? I think I need to read carefully.\n\nFrom the list: \"senrpus is xuttpus.\" This means senrpus belongs to xuttpus category? Or since senrpus is also said to be babcpus, it might be that senrpus has multiple categories.\n\nBut typically, \"A is B\" means A is a type of B, so B is a category.\n\nSimilarly, \"xorfpus is babbpus\" means xorfpus is a type of babbpus, so babbpus is a category that includes xorfpus.\n\nBut for x to be babbpus, x must be in the category babbpus, meaning either x is directly babbpus or x is in something that is in babbpus, etc.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus.\n\nSo, let's trace from x to babbpus.\n\nx is nufrpus.\n\nnufrpus is vukmpus and kufkpus.\n\nSo x is vukmpus.\n\nNow, vukmpus is pitwpus. From: vukmpus is pitwpus.\n\nAlso, vukmpus is vurwpus? From: vukmpus is vurwpus? No, let's see: \"vukmpus is pitwpus.\" and \"vurwpus is doyppus.\" but also \"vukmpus is vurwpus\"? From the list: \"vukmpus is pitwpus.\" and \"vukmpus is vurwpus.\"? I think I missed it.\n\nLook at the given: \"vukmpus is pitwpus.\" and then \"vurwpus is doyppus.\" but also \"nufrpus is vukmpus and kufkpus\" and \"vukmpus is vurwpus\"? No, from the list: \"vukmpus is pitwpus.\" is given, and then \"vukmpus is vurwpus\" is not directly said. Let's read all.\n\nFrom the given information: \n\n\"vukmpus is pitwpus.\" \n\nand later \"vurwpus is doyppus.\" \n\nbut also from \"nufrpus is vukmpus and kufkpus\" so nufrpus includes vukmpus.\n\nBut from another part: \"vukmpus is vurwpus\" is not stated. Instead, I see: \"vurwpus is doyppus\" and \"doyppus is rinjpus and deyjpus\" etc.\n\nBut from x, since x is nufrpus, and nufrpus is vukmpus, so x is vukmpus.\n\nNow, vukmpus is pitwpus, so x is pitwpus.\n\npitwpus is noxlpus? From \"pitwpus is noxlpus.\" so x is noxlpus? But I need babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is related to xorfpus.\n\nxorfpus is babbpus, so if I can find if x is xorfpus or connected to xorfpus.\n\nxorfpus is mentioned in: sixqpus is xorfpus. From \"sixqpus is xorfpus.\"\n\nAnd sixqpus is from: gasfpus is sixqpus and yijlpus.\n\nAnd gasfpus is from: golcpus is gasfpus? From \"golcpus is gasfpus.\" \n\nBut also golcpus is danjpus, and danjpus is zufqpus, etc.\n\nBut I need to see if x is connected to xorfpus.\n\nSince x is vukmpus, and vukmpus is pitwpus, pitwpus is noxlpus, but that doesn't seem to lead to xorfpus.\n\nPerhaps from other paths.\n\nx is also kufkpus from nufrpus, but kufkpus is not mentioned elsewhere, so可能 not helpful.\n\nNow, vukmpus is also mentioned in: nufrpus is vukmpus, but vukmpus itself is pitwpus, but is there another relation for vukmpus?\n\nFrom the list: \"vukmpus is vurwpus\" is not stated. Let's check the given text: \"vukmpus is pitwpus.\" and then \"vurwpus is doyppus.\" and also \"vukmpus is vurwpus\" is not there.\n\nBut I see: \"vukmpus is vurwpus\" might be a mistake? No, in the given: \"vukmpus is pitwpus. rinjpus is dipgpus. vukmpus is pitwpus. puqvpus is nerdpus and zezkpus. melspus is cultpus. ...\" wait, I think I have it.\n\nFrom the beginning: \"dadypus is heybpus. golcpus is danjpus. dozkpus is puqvpus. dadypus is rutfpus. rinjpus is dipgpus. vukmpus is pitwpus. puqvpus is nerdpus and zezkpus. melspus is cultpus. qakxpus is coyvpus and cipmpus. dipgpus is dozkpus. gasfpus is sixqpus and yijlpus. dotqpus is senrpus. lewppus is qasjpus. cultpus is vodkpus. doyppus is rinjpus and deyjpus. melspus is yizqpus. vodkpus is donfpus and woztpus. sixqpus is xorfpus. zufqpus is sobqpus and muhspus. vidcpus is himrpus and yivxpus. golcpus is qakxpus. senrpus is xuttpus. sobqpus is dadypus and ganjpus. vukmpus is vurwpus. gezzpus is golcpus and kiddpus. doyppus is ropgpus. vurwpus is doyppus. x is nufrpus. ropgpus is lewppus and fupzpus. nufrpus is vukmpus and kufkpus. nerdpus is melspus and riccpus. xorfpus is babbpus and zasspus and ratppus. qasjpus is vidcpus. pitwpus is noxlpus. coyvpus is dotqpus. senrpus is babcpus. golcpus is gasfpus. danjpus is zufqpus. cultpus is gezzpus.\"\n\nSo, from this, I see \"vukmpus is vurwpus\" is actually stated! In the list: \"vukmpus is vurwpus.\" Yes, after \"sobqpus is dadypus and ganjpus.\" then \"vukmpus is vurwpus.\" so vukmpus is vurwpus.\n\nSo, since x is vukmpus, and vukmpus is vurwpus, so x is vurwpus.\n\nNow, vurwpus is doyppus? From \"vurwpus is doyppus.\" so x is doyppus.\n\ndoyppus is rinjpus and deyjpus? From \"doyppus is rinjpus and deyjpus.\" so x is rinjpus and deyjpus.\n\nAlso, doyppus is ropgpus? From \"doyppus is ropgpus.\" so x is ropgpus.\n\nropgpus is lewppus and fupzpus? From \"ropgpus is lewppus and fupzpus.\" so x is lewppus and fupzpus.\n\nlewppus is qasjpus? From \"lewppus is qasjpus.\" so x is qasjpus.\n\nqasjpus is vidcpus? From \"qasjpus is vidcpus.\" so x is vidcpus.\n\nvidcpus is himrpus and yivxpus? From \"vidcpus is himrpus and yivxpus.\" so x is himrpus and yivxpus.\n\nBut I need babbpus and babcpus.\n\nbabbpus is from xorfpus, and babcpus is from senrpus.\n\nSo, I need to see if x is connected to xorfpus or to senrpus.\n\nFrom above, x is vidcpus, but vidcpus doesn't seem directly related to xorfpus or senrpus.\n\nPerhaps from other paths.\n\nx is also doyppus, which is rinjpus, and rinjpus is dipgpus? From \"rinjpus is dipgpus.\" so x is dipgpus.\n\ndipgpus is dozkpus? From \"dipgpus is dozkpus.\" so x is dozkpus.\n\ndozkpus is puqvpus? From \"dozkpus is puqvpus.\" so x is puqvpus.\n\npuqvpus is nerdpus and zezkpus? From \"puqvpus is nerdpus and zezkpus.\" so x is nerdpus and zezkpus.\n\nnerdpus is melspus and riccpus? From \"nerdpus is melspus and riccpus.\" so x is melspus and riccpus.\n\nmelspus is cultpus? From \"melspus is cultpus.\" so x is cultpus.\n\ncultpus is vodkpus? From \"cultpus is vodkpus.\" so x is vodkpus.\n\nvodkpus is donfpus and woztpus? From \"vodkpus is donfpus and woztpus.\" so x is donfpus and woztpus.\n\nAlso, melspus is yizqpus? From \"melspus is yizqpus.\" so x is yizqpus.\n\nBut still not xorfpus.\n\ncultpus is gezzpus? From \"cultpus is gezzpus.\" so x is gezzpus.\n\ngezzpus is golcpus and kiddpus? From \"gezzpus is golcpus and kiddpus.\" so x is golcpus and kiddpus.\n\ngolcpus is gasfpus? From \"golcpus is gasfpus.\" so x is gasfpus.\n\ngasfpus is sixqpus and yijlpus? From \"gasfpus is sixqpus and yijlpus.\" so x is sixqpus and yijlpus.\n\nsixqpus is xorfpus? From \"sixqpus is xorfpus.\" so x is xorfpus!\n\nYes! Since x is sixqpus, and sixqpus is xorfpus, so x is xorfpus.\n\nNow, xorfpus is babbpus and zasspus and ratppus? From \"xorfpus is babbpus and zasspus and ratppus.\" so since x is xorfpus, x is babbpus.\n\nSo, x is babbpus.\n\nNow, we need to see if x is also babcpus.\n\nbabcpus is from senrpus? From \"senrpus is babcpus.\" so if x is senrpus or in senrpus, then x is babcpus.\n\nSo, we need to see if x is senrpus.\n\nFrom earlier, x is doyppus, which is ropgpus, which is lewppus, which is qasjpus, which is vidcpus, but vidcpus is himrpus and yivxpus, not senrpus.\n\nBut from other paths, we have coyvpus is dotqpus? And dotqpus is senrpus? From \"dotqpus is senrpus.\" so if x is coyvpus, then x is dotqpus, then senrpus.\n\nBut is x coyvpus?\n\nFrom earlier, x is golcpus, and golcpus is qakxpus? From \"golcpus is qakxpus.\" so x is qakxpus.\n\nqakxpus is coyvpus and cipmpus? From \"qakxpus is coyvpus and cipmpus.\" so x is coyvpus and cipmpus.\n\nTherefore, x is coyvpus.\n\nThen, coyvpus is dotqpus? From \"coyvpus is dotqpus.\" so x is dotqpus.\n\ndotqpus is senrpus? From \"dotqpus is senrpus.\" so x is senrpus.\n\nsenrpus is babcpus? From \"senrpus is babcpus.\" so x is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus.\n\nSo, since x is both babbpus and babcpus, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me confirm if there are any contradictions or missing links.\n\nWe have x is nufrpus, which leads to vukmpus, which leads to vurwpus, which leads to doyppus, which leads to rinjpus, which leads to dipgpus, which leads to dozkpus, which leads to puqvpus, which leads to nerdpus, which leads to melspus, which leads to cultpus, which leads to gezzpus, which leads to golcpus, which leads to gasfpus, which leads to sixqpus, which leads to xorfpus, which leads to babbpus. So yes, x is babbpus.\n\nAlso, from golcpus, which x is, golcpus is qakxpus, which leads to coyvpus, which leads to dotqpus, which leads to senrpus, which leads to babcpus. So yes, x is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babbpus and babcpus.\n\nSo, the answer is true.",

IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, the answer is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus. From the given information, x is dajfpus. So, I need to trace what dajfpus is and see if it connects to these categories.\n\nLet me list out the relevant statements:\n\n- x is dajfpus.\n\nI need to find what dajfpus is. From the information: \"dajfpus is mentpus.\" So, dajfpus belongs to mentpus.\n\nThen, mentpus is zedspus and zofnpus and kuswpus. So mentpus has multiple categories.\n\nBut I need to see if x is babgpus, etc. So I need to find connections to babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus.\n\nLet me find where babgpus is mentioned. From the information: \"voqspus is babgpus and viqhpus and fovtpus.\" And \"lelspus is voqspus.\" And \"wawppus is lelspus.\" And \"hejfpus is wawppus.\" And \"faykpus is hejfpus.\" And \"boqvpus is faykpus.\" And \"bucgpus is boqvpus.\" And \"hifwpus is bucgpus and ripkpus and wesypus.\" And so on. But this might not directly help with x.\n\nI need to see if x is connected to voqspus or something that leads to babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, for babkpus: \"tiyxpus is babkpus.\" And \"tiyxpus is dutcpus and nughpus.\" Also, \"wesrpus is tiyxpus and kuyvpus.\" And \"kulrpus is wesrpus and yekqpus.\" And \"keyqpus is fumnpus.\" But keyqpus is also labxpus? \"labxpus is keyqpus.\" And \"lupcpus is labxpus and pakjpus.\" And \"jozbpus is lupcpus and levbpus and noklpus.\" And so on. Again, not directly related to x.\n\nFor babmpus: \"nofmpus is babmpus.\" And \"dewqpus is nofmpus.\" And \"xoqzpus is dewqpus.\" And \"tuprpus is xoqzpus.\" And \"somwpus is tuprpus.\" And \"pivgpus is somwpus and qorlpus.\" And \"gihvpus is pivgpus and zucfpus.\" And \"xosfpus is gihvpus.\" And \"gedbpus is xosfpus and bazjpus and nehfpus.\" And \"xizppus is gedbpus.\" And \"kawjpus is xizppus.\" And \"niyvpus is kawjpus.\" And \"tuwppus is niyvpus.\" And \"harxpus is tuwppus and lecjpus.\" And \"xavrpus is harxpus and joqxpus.\" And \"xezfpus is xavrpus and fichpus.\" And \"gerbpus is xezfpus.\" And \"bevypus is gerbpus and mutxpus.\" And \"vewvpus is bevypus.\" And \"repbpus is vewvpus.\" And \"davhpus is repbpus and ragspus.\" And \"duzhpus is davhpus and pufhpus.\" And \"melwpus is duzhpus.\" And \"fewdpus is melwpus and jofnpus.\" And \"kekfpus is fewdpus.\" And \"zeyqpus is kekfpus and sikxpus and repkpus.\" And \"fotcpus is zeyqpus.\" And \"kexqpus is fotcpus.\" And \"rerdpus is kexqpus and lazqpus and larzpus.\" And \"kughpus is rerdpus.\" And \"vocwpus is kughpus and didgpus.\" And \"safkpus is vocwpus.\" And \"cepjpus is safkpus.\" And \"xoggpus is cepjpus.\" And \"tifmpus is xoggpus.\" And \"qulqpus is tifmpus and nezdpus and folrpus.\" And \"ziwzpus is qulqpus.\" And \"foxfpus is ziwzpus.\" And \"xetkpus is foxfpus.\" And \"fordpus is xetkpus.\" And \"quwxpus is fordpus.\" And \"siqlpus is quwxpus.\" And \"suqnpus is siqlpus.\" And \"jichpus is suqnpus.\" And \"fodwpus is jichpus.\" And \"rapzpus is fodwpus.\" And \"sechpus is rapzpus.\" And \"qufmpus is sechpus and xaqwpus and soqdpus.\" And \"mupspus is qufmpus.\" And \"mokrpus is mupspus and jalmpus.\" And \"hojfpus is mokrpus and puvfpus.\" And \"pabppus is hojfpus and lipgpus and toqnpus.\" And \"dubtpus is pabppus and fizjpus.\" And \"fomlpus is dubtpus and regfpus.\" And \"guvspus is netkpus and tovppus.\" And \"zedspus is guvspus.\" And \"mentpus is zedspus and zofnpus and kuswpus.\" And \"dajfpus is mentpus.\" And \"x is dajfpus.\"\n\nSo, from x, we have x is dajfpus, which is mentpus, which includes zedspus, and zedspus is guvspus, which is netkpus and tovppus, and netkpus is fomlpus, which is dubtpus and regfpus, and dubtpus is pabppus and fizjpus, and so on. This is a long chain, but I need to see if x is babmpus.\n\nbabmpus is nofmpus, and nofmpus is mentioned in dewqpus is nofmpus, and dewqpus is from xoqzpus, etc. But from x, is there a connection to nofmpus?\n\nFrom the chain above, x is dajfpus is mentpus is zedspus is guvspus, etc. But guvspus is netkpus and tovppus, netkpus is fomlpus, fomlpus is dubtpus and regfpus, dubtpus is pabppus and fizjpus, pabppus is hojfpus and lipgpus and toqnpus, hojfpus is mokrpus and puvfpus, mokrpus is mupspus and jalmpus, mupspus is qufmpus, qufmpus is sechpus and xaqwpus and soqdpus, sechpus is rapzpus, rapzpus is fodwpus, fodwpus is jichpus, jichpus is suqnpus, suqnpus is siqlpus, siqlpus is quwxpus, quwxpus is fordpus, fordpus is xetkpus, xetkpus is foxfpus, foxfpus is ziwzpus, ziwzpus is qulqpus, qulqpus is tifmpus and nezdpus and folrpus, tifmpus is xoggpus, xoggpus is cepjpus, cepjpus is safkpus, safkpus is vocwpus, vocwpus is kughpus and didgpus, kughpus is rerdpus, rerdpus is kexqpus and lazqpus and larzpus, kexqpus is fotcpus, fotcpus is zeyqpus, zeyqpus is kekfpus and sikxpus and repkpus, kekfpus is fewdpus, fewdpus is melwpus and jofnpus, melwpus is duzhpus, duzhpus is davhpus and pufhpus, davhpus is repbpus and ragspus, repbpus is vewvpus, vewvpus is bevypus, bevypus is gerbpus and mutxpus, gerbpus is xezfpus, xezfpus is xavrpus and fichpus, xavrpus is harxpus and joqxpus, harxpus is tuwppus and lecjpus, tuwppus is niyvpus, niyvpus is kawjpus, kawjpus is xizppus, xizppus is gedbpus, gedbpus is xosfpus and bazjpus and nehfpus, xosfpus is gihvpus, gihvpus is pivgpus and zucfpus, pivgpus is somwpus and qorlpus, somwpus is tuprpus, tuprpus is xoqzpus, xoqzpus is dewqpus, dewqpus is nofmpus, and nofmpus is babmpus.\n\nSo, indeed, through this long chain, x is connected to nofmpus, which is babmpus. Therefore, x is babmpus.\n\nBut I need to check if x is babgpus and babkpus as well.\n\nNow, for babgpus. babgpus is part of voqspus, as voqspus is babgpus and viqhpus and fovtpus.\n\nvoqspus is from lelspus: lelspus is voqspus.\n\nlelspus is from wawppus: wawppus is lelspus.\n\nwawppus is from hejfpus: hejfpus is wawppus.\n\nhejfpus is from faykpus: faykpus is hejfpus.\n\nfaykpus is from boqvpus: boqvpus is faykpus.\n\nboqvpus is from bucgpus: bucgpus is boqvpus.\n\nbucgpus is from hifwpus: hifwpus is bucgpus and ripkpus and wesypus.\n\nhifwpus is from yibcpus: yibcpus is hifwpus and quwlpus.\n\nyibcpus is from majgpus: majgpus is yibcpus and yudcpus.\n\nmajgpus is from vescpus: vescpus is majgpus.\n\nvescpus is from ziqypus: ziqypus is vescpus.\n\nziqypus is from cuhppus: cuhppus is sexjpus, but sexjpus is ziqypus? Let's see: \"sexjpus is ziqypus.\" Yes, from the information: \"sexjpus is ziqypus.\"\n\nAnd cuhppus is from nuzfpus: nuzfpus is cuhppus and haqlpus.\n\nnuzfpus is from kurbpus: kurbpus is nuzfpus.\n\nkurbpus is from vijkpus: vijkpus is kurbpus and ruggpus and kizfpus.\n\nvijkpus is from fokjpus: fokjpus is vijkpus.\n\nfokjpus is from liznpus: liznpus is fokjpus and camgpus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is connected to this chain.\n\nx is dajfpus is mentpus, etc. But from mentpus, is there a connection to ziqypus or something?\n\nFrom earlier, we have mentpus is zedspus and zofnpus and kuswpus. zedspus is guvspus, which is netkpus and tovppus, netkpus is fomlpus, etc., but that chain led to babmpus, not necessarily to babgpus.\n\nPerhaps from other parts.\n\nNotice that davhpus is involved in multiple places. From the babmpus chain, we had davhpus, and davhpus is also mentioned in other contexts.\n\ndavhpus is from duzhpus: duzhpus is davhpus and pufhpus.\n\nAnd duzhpus is from melwpus: melwpus is duzhpus.\n\nAnd melwpus is from fewdpus: fewdpus is melwpus and jofnpus.\n\nAnd fewdpus is from kekfpus: kekfpus is fewdpus.\n\nAnd kekfpus is from zeyqpus: zeyqpus is kekfpus and sikxpus and repkpus.\n\nBut this is part of the babmpus chain.\n\nFor babgpus, we need voqspus.\n\nvoqspus is from lelspus, and lelspus is from wawppus, etc.\n\nBut is there a connection from x to hejfpus or something?\n\nx is dajfpus is mentpus. mentpus is zedspus, etc.\n\nBut let's see if zedspus connects to hejfpus.\n\nzedspus is guvspus, which is netkpus and tovppus. netkpus is fomlpus, fomlpus is dubtpus and regfpus, dubtpus is pabppus and fizjpus, pabppus is hojfpus and lipgpus and toqnpus, hojfpus is mokrpus and puvfpus, mokrpus is mupspus and jalmpus, mupspus is qufmpus, etc. This seems to go to babmpus again, not to hejfpus.\n\nhejfpus is from faykpus, and faykpus is from boqvpus, and boqvpus is from bucgpus, and bucgpus is from hifwpus, and hifwpus is from yibcpus, and yibcpus is from majgpus, and majgpus is from vescpus, and vescpus is from ziqypus, and ziqypus is from sexjpus, but sexjpus is also mentioned: \"sexjpus is ziqypus\" and \"cuhppus is sexjpus\" from \"nuzfpus is cuhppus and haqlpus\" but nuzfpus is from kurbpus, etc.\n\nBut where is x in this? x is dajfpus is mentpus. Is mentpus connected to sexjpus or ziqypus?\n\nFrom the information, we have \"ziqypus is zohfpus\" but also \"ziqypus is vescpus\", so ziqypus has multiple categories.\n\nBut from x, I don't see a direct link to ziqypus.\n\nPerhaps through other means.\n\nAnother thing: \"davhpus is tomqpus\" from \"davhpus is tomqpus\" and \"tomqpus is molzpus and nawcpus\" but that might not help.\n\nAlso, \"davhpus is sumqpus and bicqpus\" but sumqpus is xuvhpus and biclpus, and xuvhpus is rorypus, and rorypus is tobypus and zuckpus, and tobypus is sohnpus, etc. but still not connecting to babgpus.\n\nFor x to be babgpus, x must be voqspus or something that contains voqspus, but from x, we have x is dajfpus is mentpus, which is zedspus, etc., and zedspus is guvspus, which is netkpus, and netkpus is fomlpus, which is dubtpus, and dubtpus is pabppus, and pabppus is hojfpus, but hojfpus is mokrpus and puvfpus, which is not voqspus.\n\nhojfpus is a category, but it doesn't include voqspus.\n\nvoqspus is from lelspus, which is from wawppus, which is from hejfpus. hejfpus is a different chain.\n\nIs hejfpus connected to x? From x, we have mentpus, which includes zedspus, and zedspus is guvspus, and guvspus is netkpus, and netkpus is fomlpus, and fomlpus is dubtpus, and dubtpus is pabppus, and pabppus is hojfpus, but hojfpus is not hejfpus. hejfpus is a different entity.\n\nhejfpus is mentioned in \"hejfpus is wawppus\" and \"faykpus is hejfpus\" so hejfpus is a category that faykpus belongs to, but from x, we don't have a link to hejfpus.\n\nPerhaps from other parts. \"faykpus is hejfpus\" and \"boqvpus is faykpus\" and \"bucgpus is boqvpus\" and \"hifwpus is bucgpus\" and \"yibcpus is hifwpus\" and \"majgpus is yibcpus\" and \"vescpus is majgpus\" and \"ziqypus is vescpus\" and \"sexjpus is ziqypus\" and \"cuhppus is sexjpus\" and \"nuzfpus is cuhppus\" and \"kurbpus is nuzfpus\" and \"vijkpus is kurbpus\" and \"fokjpus is vijkpus\" and \"liznpus is fokjpus\" but liznpus is not connected to x.\n\nx is dajfpus is mentpus. mentpus is zedspus and zofnpus and kuswpus. zofnpus and kuswpus are not elaborated, so perhaps through them? But from the information, we don't have what zofnpus or kuswpus is, so it might be unknown.\n\nBut let's see if there is any connection from zedspus to hejfpus. zedspus is guvspus, guvspus is netkpus and tovppus. tovppus is not defined, so可能 unknown.\n\nnetkpus is fomlpus, which is dubtpus and regfpus, regfpus is not defined, so可能 unknown.\n\ndubtpus is pabppus and fizjpus, fizjpus not defined.\n\npabppus is hojfpus and lipgpus and toqnpus, lipgpus and toqnpus not defined.\n\nhojfpus is mokrpus and puvfpus, which we know, but mokrpus is mupspus and jalmpus, mupspus is qufmpus, etc., all leading away from hejfpus.\n\nSo, from x, there is no path to hejfpus or voqspus that I can find. Therefore, x is not babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, for babkpus. babkpus is from tiyxpus: \"tiyxpus is babkpus.\"\n\ntiyxpus is from wesrpus: \"wesrpus is tiyxpus and kuyvpus.\"\n\nwesrpus is from kulrpus: \"kulrpus is wesrpus and yekqpus.\"\n\nkulrpus is from fumnpus: \"fumnpus is kulrpus.\"\n\nfumnpus is from keyqpus: \"keyqpus is fumnpus.\"\n\nkeyqpus is from labxpus: \"labxpus is keyqpus.\"\n\nlabxpus is from lupcpus: \"lupcpus is labxpus and pakjpus.\"\n\nlupcpus is from jozbpus: \"jozbpus is lupcpus and levbpus and noklpus.\"\n\njozbpus is from mucbpus: \"mucbpus is jozbpus.\"? Not directly, but from \"gevtpus is mucbpus\" and \"hayqpus is gevtpus\" and \"lefnpus is hayqpus\" and \"mogkpus is lefnpus\" and \"ruxfpus is mogkpus\" and \"nimspus is ruxfpus\" but nimspus is also from bozhpus: \"bozhpus is kelypus\" and \"kelypus is nimspus\" but from other side.\n\nBut for x to be babkpus, x must be tiyxpus or contain it.\n\nFrom x, we have x is dajfpus is mentpus, which is zedspus, etc. From the babmpus chain, we went through many things, but not to tiyxpus.\n\nFrom davhpus, we have davhpus is sumqpus, and sumqpus is xuvhpus and biclpus, and xuvhpus is rorypus, and rorypus is tobypus and zuckpus, and tobypus is sohnpus, and sohnpus is relfpus and dowcpus, and relfpus is qaxgpus and gabbpus, and qaxgpus is nobypus, and nobypus is cixbpus, and cixbpus is tegcpus, and tegcpus is qijqpus, and qijqpus is purtpus? Wait, \"qijqpus is purtpus\" but from \"tegcpus is qijqpus\" and \"qijqpus is naklpus\"? Let's see: \"qijqpus is naklpus\" from the information? No, from \"qijqpus is purtpus\" is not stated, let's read.\n\nFrom information: \"tegcpus is qijqpus.\" and \"qijqpus is naklpus.\"? I think I misremembered.\n\nLet's find: \"tegcpus is qijqpus.\" and then \"qijqpus is purtpus\" is not in the information.

Therefore, x is babmpus.\n\nBut I need to check if x is babgpus and babkpus as well.\n\nNow, for babgpus. babgpus is part of voqspus, as voqspus is babgpus and viqhpus and fovtpus.\n\nvoqspus is from lelspus: lelspus is voqspus.\n\nlelspus is from wawppus: wawppus is lelspus.\n\nwawppus is from hejfpus: hejfpus is wawppus.\n\nhejfpus is from faykpus: faykpus is hejfpus.\n\nfaykpus is from boqvpus: boqvpus is faykpus.\n\nboqvpus is from bucgpus: bucgpus is boqvpus.\n\nbucgpus is from hifwpus: hifwpus is bucgpus and ripkpus and wesypus.\n\nhifwpus is from yibcpus: yibcpus is hifwpus and quwlpus.\n\nyibcpus is from majgpus: majgpus is yibcpus and yudcpus.\n\nmajgpus is from vescpus: vescpus is majgpus.\n\nvescpus is from ziqypus: ziqypus is vescpus.\n\nziqypus is from cuhppus: cuhppus is sexjpus, but sexjpus is ziqypus? Let's see: \"sexjpus is ziqypus.\" Yes, from the information: \"sexjpus is ziqypus.\"\n\nAnd cuhppus is from nuzfpus: nuzfpus is cuhppus and haqlpus.\n\nnuzfpus is from kurbpus: kurbpus is nuzfpus.\n\nkurbpus is from vijkpus: vijkpus is kurbpus and ruggpus and kizfpus.\n\nvijkpus is from fokjpus: fokjpus is vijkpus.\n\nfokjpus is from liznpus: liznpus is fokjpus and camgpus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is connected to this chain.\n\nx is dajfpus is mentpus, etc. But from mentpus, is there a connection to ziqypus or something?\n\nFrom earlier, we have mentpus is zedspus and zofnpus and kuswpus. zedspus is guvspus, which is netkpus and tovppus, netkpus is fomlpus, etc., but that chain led to babmpus, not necessarily to babgpus.\n\nPerhaps from other parts.\n\nNotice that davhpus is involved in multiple places. From the babmpus chain, we had davhpus, and davhpus is also mentioned in other contexts.\n\ndavhpus is from duzhpus: duzhpus is davhpus and pufhpus.\n\nAnd duzhpus is from melwpus: melwpus is duzhpus.\n\nAnd melwpus is from fewdpus: fewdpus is melwpus and jofnpus.\n\nAnd fewdpus is from kekfpus: kekfpus is fewdpus.\n\nAnd kekfpus is from zeyqpus: zeyqpus is kekfpus and sikxpus and repkpus.\n\nBut this is part of the babmpus chain.\n\nFor babgpus, we need voqspus.\n\nvoqspus is from lelspus, and lelspus is from wawppus, etc.\n\nBut is there a connection from x to hejfpus or something?\n\nx is dajfpus is mentpus. mentpus is zedspus, etc.\n\nBut let's see if zedspus connects to hejfpus.\n\nzedspus is guvspus, which is netkpus and tovppus. netkpus is fomlpus, fomlpus is dubtpus and regfpus, dubtpus is pabppus and fizjpus, pabppus is hojfpus and lipgpus and toqnpus, hojfpus is mokrpus and puvfpus, mokrpus is mupspus and jalmpus, mupspus is qufmpus, etc. This seems to go to babmpus again, not to hejfpus.\n\nhejfpus is from faykpus, and faykpus is from boqvpus, and boqvpus is from bucgpus, and bucgpus is from hifwpus, and hifwpus is from yibcpus, and yibcpus is from majgpus, and majgpus is from vescpus, and vescpus is from ziqypus, and ziqypus is from sexjpus, but sexjpus is also mentioned: \"sexjpus is ziqypus\" and \"cuhppus is sexjpus\" from \"nuzfpus is cuhppus and haqlpus\" but nuzfpus is from kurbpus, etc.\n\nBut where is x in this? x is dajfpus is mentpus. Is mentpus connected to sexjpus or ziqypus?\n\nFrom the information, we have \"ziqypus is zohfpus\" but also \"ziqypus is vescpus\", so ziqypus has multiple categories.\n\nBut from x, I don't see a direct link to ziqypus.\n\nPerhaps through other means.\n\nAnother thing: \"davhpus is tomqpus\" from \"davhpus is tomqpus\" and \"tomqpus is molzpus and nawcpus\" but that might not help.\n\nAlso, \"davhpus is sumqpus and bicqpus\" but sumqpus is xuvhpus and biclpus, and xuvhpus is rorypus, and rorypus is tobypus and zuckpus, and tobypus is sohnpus, etc. but still not connecting to babgpus.\n\nFor x to be babgpus, x must be voqspus or something that contains voqspus, but from x, we have x is dajfpus is mentpus, which is zedspus, etc., and zedspus is guvspus, which is netkpus, and netkpus is fomlpus, which is dubtpus, and dubtpus is pabppus, and pabppus is hojfpus, but hojfpus is mokrpus and puvfpus, which is not voqspus.\n\nhojfpus is a category, but it doesn't include voqspus.\n\nvoqspus is from lelspus, which is from wawppus, which is from hejfpus. hejfpus is a different chain.\n\nIs hejfpus connected to x? From x, we have mentpus, which includes zedspus, and zedspus is guvspus, and guvspus is netkpus, and netkpus is fomlpus, and fomlpus is dubtpus, and dubtpus is pabppus, and pabppus is hojfpus, but hojfpus is not hejfpus. hejfpus is a different entity.\n\nhejfpus is mentioned in \"hejfpus is wawppus\" and \"faykpus is hejfpus\" so hejfpus is a category that faykpus belongs to, but from x, we don't have a link to hejfpus.\n\nPerhaps from other parts. \"faykpus is hejfpus\" and \"boqvpus is faykpus\" and \"bucgpus is boqvpus\" and \"hifwpus is bucgpus\" and \"yibcpus is hifwpus\" and \"majgpus is yibcpus\" and \"vescpus is majgpus\" and \"ziqypus is vescpus\" and \"sexjpus is ziqypus\" and \"cuhppus is sexjpus\" and \"nuzfpus is cuhppus\" and \"kurbpus is nuzfpus\" and \"vijkpus is kurbpus\" and \"fokjpus is vijkpus\" and \"liznpus is fokjpus\" but liznpus is not connected to x.\n\nx is dajfpus is mentpus. mentpus is zedspus and zofnpus and kuswpus. zofnpus and kuswpus are not elaborated, so perhaps through them? But from the information, we don't have what zofnpus or kuswpus is, so it might be unknown.\n\nBut let's see if there is any connection from zedspus to hejfpus. zedspus is guvspus, guvspus is netkpus and tovppus. tovppus is not defined, so可能 unknown.\n\nnetkpus is fomlpus, which is dubtpus and regfpus, regfpus is not defined, so可能 unknown.\n\ndubtpus is pabppus and fizjpus, fizjpus not defined.\n\npabppus is hojfpus and lipgpus and toqnpus, lipgpus and toqnpus not defined.\n\nhojfpus is mokrpus and puvfpus, which we know, but mokrpus is mupspus and jalmpus, mupspus is qufmpus, etc., all leading away from hejfpus.\n\nSo, from x, there is no path to hejfpus or voqspus that I can find. Therefore, x is not babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, for babkpus. babkpus is from tiyxpus: \"tiyxpus is babkpus.\"\n\ntiyxpus is from wesrpus: \"wesrpus is tiyxpus and kuyvpus.\"\n\nwesrpus is from kulrpus: \"kulrpus is wesrpus and yekqpus.\"\n\nkulrpus is from fumnpus: \"fumnpus is kulrpus.\"\n\nfumnpus is from keyqpus: \"keyqpus is fumnpus.\"\n\nkeyqpus is from labxpus: \"labxpus is keyqpus.\"\n\nlabxpus is from lupcpus: \"lupcpus is labxpus and pakjpus.\"\n\nlupcpus is from jozbpus: \"jozbpus is lupcpus and levbpus and noklpus.\"\n\njozbpus is from mucbpus: \"mucbpus is jozbpus.\"? Not directly, but from \"gevtpus is mucbpus\" and \"hayqpus is gevtpus\" and \"lefnpus is hayqpus\" and \"mogkpus is lefnpus\" and \"ruxfpus is mogkpus\" and \"nimspus is ruxfpus\" but nimspus is also from bozhpus: \"bozhpus is kelypus\" and \"kelypus is nimspus\" but from other side.\n\nBut for x to be babkpus, x must be tiyxpus or contain it.\n\nFrom x, we have x is dajfpus is mentpus, which is zedspus, etc. From the babmpus chain, we went through many things, but not to tiyxpus.\n\nFrom davhpus, we have davhpus is sumqpus, and sumqpus is xuvhpus and biclpus, and xuvhpus is rorypus, and rorypus is tobypus and zuckpus, and tobypus is sohnpus, and sohnpus is relfpus and dowcpus, and relfpus is qaxgpus and gabbpus, and qaxgpus is nobypus, and nobypus is cixbpus, and cixbpus is tegcpus, and tegcpus is qijqpus, and qijqpus is purtpus? Wait, \"qijqpus is purtpus\" but from \"tegcpus is qijqpus\" and \"qijqpus is naklpus\"? Let's see: \"qijqpus is naklpus\" from the information? No, from \"qijqpus is purtpus\" is not stated, let's read.\n\nFrom information: \"tegcpus is qijqpus.\" and \"qijqpus is naklpus.\"? I think I misremembered.\n\nLet's find: \"tegcpus is qijqpus.\" and then \"qijqpus is purtpus\" is not in the information. Instead, from \"nobypus is cixbpus\" and \"cixbpus is tegcpus\" so cixbpus is tegcpus, and tegcpus is qijqpus, but what is qijqpus? From information: \"qijqpus is naklpus.\" Yes, from \"qijqpus is naklpus.\" and \"naklpus is liznpus.\" and \"liznpus is fokjpus and camgpus.\" etc., but this doesn't lead to tiyxpus.\n\nAlso, tobypus is sohnpus, and sohnpus is relfpus and dowcpus, and dowcpus is not defined, relfpus is qaxgpus and gabbpus, which is not tiyxpus.\n\nSo, from x, no connection to tiyxpus. Therefore, x is not babkpus.\n\nBut from the babmpus chain, we found that x is babmpus, so for babgpus and babkpus, it seems false.\n\nBut let's confirm babmpus.\n\nFrom x: x is dajfpus\n\ndajfpus is mentpus\n\nmentpus is zedspus and zofnpus and kuswpus\n\nzedspus is guvspus\n\nguvspus is netkpus and tovppus\n\nnetkpus is fomlpus\n\nfomlpus is dubtpus and regfpus\n\ndubtpus is pabppus and fizjpus\n\npabppus is hojfpus and lipgpus and toqnpus\n\nhojfpus is mokrpus and puvfpus\n\nmokrpus is mupspus and jalmpus\n\nmupspus is qufmpus\n\nqufmpus is sechpus and xaqwpus and soqdpus\n\nsechpus is rapzpus\n\nrapzpus is fodwpus\n\nfodwpus is jichpus\n\njichpus is suqnpus\n\nsuqnpus is siqlpus\n\nsiqlpus is quwxpus\n\nquwxpus is fordpus\n\nfordpus is xetkpus\n\nxetkpus is foxfpus\n\nfoxfpus is ziwzpus\n\nziwzpus is qulqpus\n\nqulqpus is tifmpus and nezdpus and folrpus\n\ntifmpus is xoggpus\n\nxoggpus is cepjpus\n\ncepjpus is safkpus\n\nsafkpus is vocwpus\n\nvocwpus is kughpus and didgpus\n\nkughpus is rerdpus\n\nrerdpus is kexqpus and lazqpus and larzpus\n\nkexqpus is fotcpus\n\nfotcpus is zeyqpus\n\nzeyqpus is kekfpus and sikxpus and repkpus\n\nkekfpus is fewdpus\n\nfewdpus is melwpus and jofnpus\n\nmelwpus is duzhpus\n\nduzhpus is davhpus and pufhpus\n\ndavhpus is repbpus and ragspus\n\nrepbpus is vewvpus\n\nvewvpus is bevypus\n\nbevypus is gerbpus and mutxpus\n\ngerbpus is xezfpus\n\nxezfpus is xavrpus and fichpus\n\nxavrpus is harxpus and joqxpus\n\nharxpus is tuwppus and lecjpus\n\ntuwppus is niyvpus\n\nniyvpus is kawjpus\n\nkawjpus is xizppus\n\nxizppus is gedbpus\n\ngedbpus is xosfpus and bazjpus and nehfpus\n\nxosfpus is gihvpus\n\ngihvpus is pivgpus and zucfpus\n\npivgpus is somwpus and qorlpus\n\nsomwpus is tuprpus\n\ntuprpus is xoqzpus\n\nxoqzpus is dewqpus\n\ndewqpus is nofmpus\n\nnofmpus is babmpus\n\nTherefore, since x is dajfpus and through this chain, dajfpus is eventually nofmpus, which is babmpus, so x is babmpus.\n\nFor babgpus and babkpus, as above, no chain found, so it is false that x is babgpus and babkpus.\n\nThe question is: \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" So since x is babmpus but not babgpus and not babkpus, the overall statement is false.\n\nSo, the answer should be false.\n\nBut let's make sure about babgpus and babkpus.\n\nFor babgpus: from voqspus, which is from lelspus, etc., and from x, no connection.

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nBut guvspus is netkpus and tovppus, netkpus is fomlpus, fomlpus is dubtpus and regfpus, dubtpus is pabppus and fizjpus, pabppus is hojfpus and lipgpus and toqnpus, hojfpus is mokrpus and puvfpus, mokrpus is mupspus and jalmpus, mupspus is qufmpus, qufmpus is sechpus and xaqwpus and soqdpus, sechpus is rapzpus, rapzpus is fodwpus, fodwpus is jichpus, jichpus is suqnpus, suqnpus is siqlpus, siqlpus is quwxpus, quwxpus is fordpus, fordpus is xetkpus, xetkpus is foxfpus, foxfpus is ziwzpus, ziwzpus is qulqpus, qulqpus is tifmpus and nezdpus and folrpus, tifmpus is xoggpus, xoggpus is cepjpus, cepjpus is safkpus, safkpus is vocwpus, vocwpus is kughpus and didgpus, kughpus is rerdpus, rerdpus is kexqpus and lazqpus and larzpus, kexqpus is fotcpus, fotcpus is zeyqpus, zeyqpus is kekfpus and sikxpus and repkpus, kekfpus is fewdpus, fewdpus is melwpus and jofnpus, melwpus is duzhpus, duzhpus is davhpus and pufhpus, davhpus is repbpus and ragspus, repbpus is vewvpus, vewvpus is bevypus, bevypus is gerbpus and mutxpus, gerbpus is xezfpus, xezfpus is xavrpus and fichpus, xavrpus is harxpus and joqxpus, harxpus is tuwppus and lecjpus, tuwppus is niyvpus, niyvpus is kawjpus, kawjpus is xizppus, xizppus is gedbpus, gedbpus is xosfpus and bazjpus and nehfpus, xosfpus is gihvpus, gihvpus is pivgpus and zucfpus, pivgpus is somwpus and qorlpus, somwpus is tuprpus, tuprpus is xoqzpus, xoqzpus is dewqpus, dewqpus is nofmpus, and nofmpus is babmpus.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nFor x to be babgpus, x must be voqspus or something that contains voqspus, but from x, we have x is dajfpus is mentpus, which is zedspus, etc.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nThus, it is false.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

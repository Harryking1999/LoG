  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus, babcpus, and babppus. The given information says that x is yiglpus and xihlpus. But I don't have any direct information about xihlpus, so I might need to focus on yiglpus.\n\nFrom the given: yiglpus is suzdpus and favrpus. So yiglpus belongs to suzdpus and favrpus. But I need to trace what yiglpus is connected to in terms of babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nI should list out all the relationships and see how they connect to x.\n\nLet me start with x: x is yiglpus and xihlpus. Since xihlpus isn't mentioned elsewhere, I might ignore it for now and focus on yiglpus.\n\nyiglpus is suzdpus and favrpus. favrpus isn't mentioned again, so I need to follow suzdpus.\n\nsuzdpus is pivmpus. From the given: suzdpus is pivmpus.\n\npivmpus is fehkpus. From: pivmpus is fehkpus.\n\nfehkpus is yolspus and also fibkpus. From: fehkpus is yolspus. And fehkpus is fibkpus? Wait, no: \"fehkpus is yolspus\" and later \"fehkpus is fibkpus\" but from \"pivmpus is fehkpus\" and \"fehkpus is fibkpus\" – let's see: \"fehkpus is yolspus\" is given, and then \"fibkpus is wuzhpus and kikxpus\" but also \"fehkpus is fibkpus\" from the last part: \"fehkpus is fibkpus\". Yes, it says: \"fehkpus is fibkpus\". So fehkpus is fibkpus.\n\nBut fibkpus is wuzhpus and kikxpus.\n\nSo from x, through yiglpus, suzdpus, pivmpus, fehkpus, to fibkpus. But I need to get to babbpus, etc.\n\nbabbpus is mentioned in cetwpus: \"cetwpus is babbpus and tayqpus\". And cetwpus is part of bibypus: \"bibypus is cetwpus and ninrpus\". And bibypus is related to soqdpus: \"soqdpus is bibypus\". And soqdpus is related to nerzpus: \"nerzpus is soqdpus\". And nerzpus is part of qupspus: \"qupspus is nerzpus and zumspus\". But qupspus is also other things.\n\nThis seems messy. I need to find a path to babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nbabcpus is mentioned in jozspus: \"jozspus is babcpus and lerqpus\". And jozspus is part of qupspus: \"qupspus is jozspus\". Similarly, babppus is mentioned in qupspus: \"qupspus is babppus and labxpus\".\n\nSo all three – babbpus, babcpus, babppus – are connected to qupspus in some way.\n\nbabbpus via cetwpus and bibypus, etc., but ultimately from qupspus.\n\nbabcpus directly from jozspus which is qupspus.\n\nbabppus directly from qupspus.\n\nSo if I can connect x to qupspus, then I might be able to say that x is qupspus, and thus since qupspus contains babppus and babcpus (via jozspus) and babbpus via other paths, but wait, no: qupspus is babppus and labxpus, meaning qupspus belongs to babppus? Or contains? The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So if qupspus is babppus, that means qupspus is a type of babppus, so babppus is a category that contains qupspus.\n\nSimilarly, jozspus is babcpus, so jozspus is a type of babcpus.\n\nAnd cetwpus is babbpus, so cetwpus is a type of babbpus.\n\nBut for x to be babbpus, it means x must be in the category babbpus, i.e., x must be contained in babbpus or be a type of babbpus.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo I need to see if x is contained in babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nSince x is yiglpus, I need to see if yiglpus is contained in these categories.\n\nBut from the relationships, I need to find if yiglpus is connected to qupspus or directly to these categories.\n\nLet me list all the relationships in a chain or graph.\n\nI see that qupspus is involved in multiple places. Also, from x, I have yiglpus -> suzdpus -> pivmpus -> fehkpus -> fibkpus -> wuzhpus -> buztpus -> ganvpus -> wepgpus -> pudrpus -> viyppus -> cabppus -> wigppus -> xavrpus -> pasmpus -> yedrpus -> fedzpus -> zefhpus -> gupnpus -> rasbpus -> gicrpus -> lurvpus -> yedqpus -> kegppus -> dixmpus -> difnpus -> xugkpus -> baybpus -> hesgpus -> powypus -> sowspus -> benvpus -> wubmpus -> hiyfpus -> nabdpus -> xocjpus -> hulvpus -> qofzpus -> doldpus -> dovqpus -> paxhpus -> zenypus -> bupdpus -> seqtpus -> qepcpus -> jobkpus -> vowkpus -> ritkpus -> qupspus\n\nThis is a long chain, but I need to see if yiglpus connects to qupspus.\n\nFrom above, I have suzdpus is pivmpus, and pivmpus is fehkpus, etc., but let's see if there is a path to qupspus.\n\nFrom the given, I have ritkpus is qupspus and yifhpus. And vowkpus is ritkpus. And jobkpus is vowkpus. And qepcpus is jobkpus. And seqtpus is qepcpus. And bupdpus is seqtpus. And zenypus is bupdpus and puxnpus. And paxhpus is zenypus. And dovqpus is paxhpus. And doldpus is dovqpus. And qofzpus is doldpus and pifypus. And hulvpus is qofzpus and teqlpus. And xocjpus is hulvpus. And nabdpus is xocjpus. And hiyfpus is nabdpus. And wubmpus is hiyfpus. And benvpus is wubmpus and sifrpus. And sowspus is benvpus. And powypus is sowspus and wufbpus. And hesgpus is powypus and zuyqpus. And baybpus is hesgpus. And xugkpus is baybpus. And difnpus is xugkpus and mechpus. And dixmpus is difnpus. And kegppus is dixmpus and valnpus. And yedqpus is kegppus and tohypus. And lurvpus is yedqpus and kedrpus and joyzpus. And gicrpus is lurvpus. And rasbpus is gicrpus. And gupnpus is rasbpus. And zefhpus is gupnpus. And fedzpus is zefhpus. And yedrpus is fedzpus. And pasmpus is yedrpus and huvhpus. And xavrpus is pasmpus. And wigppus is xavrpus. And cabppus is wigppus. And viyppus is cabppus. And pudrpus is viyppus. And wepgpus is pudrpus and leqzpus and werxpus. And ganvpus is wepgpus. And buztpus is ganvpus and lertpus. And wuzhpus is buztpus and pitkpus. And fibkpus is wuzhpus and kikxpus. And fehkpus is fibkpus. And pivmpus is fehkpus. And suzdpus is pivmpus. And yiglpus is suzdpus.\n\nSo from yiglpus, we have a long chain that eventually leads to qupspus through the above path.\n\nBut in the chain, I have from ritkpus to qupspus: ritkpus is qupspus and yifhpus, so ritkpus belongs to qupspus? No: \"ritkpus is qupspus\" means ritkpus is contained in qupspus, so qupspus is a category that contains ritkpus.\n\nSimilarly, from above, we have vowkpus is ritkpus, so vowkpus is contained in ritkpus, and thus in qupspus.\n\nJobkpus is vowkpus, so contained in vowkpus, etc.\n\nSo going backwards, from qupspus, it contains ritkpus, which contains vowkpus, which contains jobkpus, which contains qepcpus? No: jobkpus is vowkpus, so jobkpus is contained in vowkpus, and vowkpus in ritkpus, etc.\n\nBut for x to be in qupspus, we need to see if x is contained in qupspus.\n\nFrom the chain, we have yiglpus is suzdpus, which is pivmpus, which is fehkpus, which is fibkpus, which is wuzhpus, which is buztpus, which is ganvpus, which is wepgpus, which is pudrpus, which is viyppus, which is cabppus, which is wigppus, which is xavrpus, which is pasmpus, which is yedrpus, which is fedzpus, which is zefhpus, which is gupnpus, which is rasbpus, which is gicrpus, which is lurvpus, which is yedqpus, which is kegppus, which is dixmpus, which is difnpus, which is xugkpus, which is baybpus, which is hesgpus, which is powypus, which is sowspus, which is benvpus, which is wubmpus, which is hiyfpus, which is nabdpus, which is xocjpus, which is hulvpus, which is qofzpus, which is doldpus, which is dovqpus, which is paxhpus, which is zenypus, which is bupdpus, which is seqtpus, which is qepcpus, which is jobkpus, which is vowkpus, which is ritkpus, which is qupspus.\n\nSo, since each \"is\" means contained in, we have that yiglpus is contained in suzdpus, which is contained in pivmpus, and so on, all the way to ritkpus, which is contained in qupspus. Therefore, yiglpus is contained in qupspus.\n\nThus, x is yiglpus, so x is contained in qupspus.\n\nNow, qupspus is babppus and labxpus, so qupspus is contained in babppus. Therefore, since x is contained in qupspus, and qupspus is contained in babppus, then x is contained in babppus. So x is babppus.\n\nSimilarly, qupspus is jozspus? From the given: \"qupspus is jozspus\" meaning qupspus is contained in jozspus? No, let's see: \"jozspus is babcpus and lerqpus\" and \"qupspus is jozspus\" – wait, from \"qupspus is jozspus\" it means qupspus is contained in jozspus.\n\nBut jozspus is babcpus and lerqpus, so jozspus is contained in babcpus.\n\nTherefore, since qupspus is contained in jozspus, and jozspus is contained in babcpus, then qupspus is contained in babcpus. And since x is contained in qupspus, then x is contained in babcpus. So x is babcpus.\n\nNow for babbpus. We have cetwpus is babbpus and tayqpus, so cetwpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nAnd cetwpus is part of bibypus: \"bibypus is cetwpus and ninrpus\", so bibypus is contained in cetwpus? No: \"bibypus is cetwpus\" means bibypus is contained in cetwpus.\n\nThen, soqdpus is bibypus, so soqdpus is contained in bibypus.\n\nAnd nerzpus is soqdpus, so nerzpus is contained in soqdpus.\n\nAnd qupspus is nerzpus and zumspus, so qupspus is contained in nerzpus? No: \"qupspus is nerzpus\" means qupspus is contained in nerzpus.\n\nFrom above: qupspus is contained in nerzpus, which is contained in soqdpus, which is contained in bibypus, which is contained in cetwpus, which is contained in babbpus.\n\nTherefore, qupspus is contained in babbpus.\n\nSince x is contained in qupspus, then x is contained in babbpus. So x is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo the statement is true.\n\nBut I need to confirm if there are any contradictions or missing links.\n\nIn the given, there is also \"x is yiglpus and xihlpus\" but since xihlpus is not defined, we can ignore it for the categories we care about, as we have shown through yiglpus.\n\nAlso, in the chain, I used a long path, but it seems consistent based on the given relationships.\n\nSo, based on this, it should be true.",

For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8.

Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

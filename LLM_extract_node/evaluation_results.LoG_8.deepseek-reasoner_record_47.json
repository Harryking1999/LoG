  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus. From the given information, I see that x is defined as sogjpus. So, x is sogjpus.\n\nNow, I need to see if sogjpus is related to babbpus. Looking at the statements:\n\n- sogjpus is favkpus and qutrpus.\n\nSo, sogjpus belongs to favkpus and also to qutrpus. But I need to connect to babbpus.\n\nI see that yaqdpus is babbpus. And also, yaqdpus is jamwpus, but that might not be directly helpful.\n\nI need to find a chain from sogjpus to babbpus.\n\nLet me list all the relationships that might be relevant.\n\nFrom sogjpus: sogjpus is favkpus.\n\nNow, favkpus is mentioned in a few places:\n\n- favkpus is sovspus and sacnpus.\n\n- favkpus is cafgpus.\n\nBut cafgpus is winjpus, which might not help.\n\nAlso, from favkpus is sovspus, and sovspus is womlpus.\n\nwomlpus is qifjpus and gaknpus.\n\nqifjpus is ravlpus.\n\nravlpus is tupvpus and qiqrpus and wesxpus and welvpus.\n\ntupvpus is mugnpus and tiwgpus.\n\nAlso, tupvpus is rigcpus.\n\nrigcpus is zaxxpus and yesvpus.\n\nzaxxpus is cikjpus and vayypus.\n\ncikjpus is xasfpus.\n\nxasfpus is lenppus.\n\nlenppus is sorxpus and kuhjpus.\n\nsorxpus is muqkpus.\n\nmuqkpus is tarfpus and yolhpus.\n\ntarfpus is yisdpus.\n\nyisdpus is xowypus and nahkpus.\n\nxowypus is yaqdpus and jidppus.\n\nyaqdpus is babbpus.\n\nAlso, yaqdpus is jamwpus, but we have yaqdpus is babbpus.\n\nSo, from favkpus, we can go through sovspus to womlpus to qifjpus to ravlpus to tupvpus to rigcpus to zaxxpus to cikjpus to xasfpus to lenppus to sorxpus to muqkpus to tarfpus to yisdpus to xowypus to yaqdpus to babbpus.\n\nThat seems like a long chain, but let's see if it's valid.\n\nBut we need to see if sogjpus is favkpus, and then through this chain to babbpus.\n\nBut is this chain correct? Let's verify step by step.\n\nFirst, sogjpus is favkpus. (given)\n\nThen, favkpus is sovspus? From the statements: \"favkpus is sovspus and sacnpus.\" So yes, favkpus belongs to sovspus.\n\nsovspus is womlpus? From \"sovspus is womlpus.\" Wait, no, let's see: \"sovspus is womlpus\" is not directly stated. I think I misread.\n\nLooking back: \"sovspus is womlpus\" is not given. Instead, from \"favkpus is sovspus and sacnpus\" and then \"sovspus is womlpus\" is that stated?\n\nI see: \"sovspus is womlpus\" – is that true? From the given information, I don't see that directly.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nI see: \"sovspus is womlpus\" is not explicitly stated. What is stated is: \"favkpus is sovspus and sacnpus\" and also \"womlpus is qifjpus and gaknpus\" but no direct link between sovspus and womlpus.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother statement: \"favkpus is cafgpus\" but cafgpus is winjpus, which might not help.\n\nI need to find another path.\n\nFrom favkpus, we have that favkpus is cafgpus? From \"favkpus is cafgpus\" – is that given?\n\nLet's list all statements about favkpus.\n\nFrom the given:\n\n\"favkpus is sovspus and sacnpus.\" – so favkpus is a type of sovspus and also sacnpus.\n\nBut also, \"favkpus is cafgpus\" – wait, is that stated? Let's see: in the list, I see \"favkpus is cafgpus\" but I need to confirm.\n\nLooking at the text: \"favkpus is sovspus and sacnpus.\" and later \"favkpus is cafgpus.\" – yes, it is given: \"favkpus is cafgpus.\" from the list.\n\nBut cafgpus is winjpus? From \"cafgpus is winjpus\" – yes, \"cafgpus is winjpus\" but winjpus is not further defined, so that might not lead to babbpus.\n\nBut we also have from favkpus is sovspus, and sovspus might be related to womlpus? But is sovspus directly related to womlpus?\n\nI see: \"sovspus is womlpus\" is not stated. Instead, we have \"womlpus is qifjpus and gaknpus\" and \"qifjpus is ravlpus\" but no sovspus to womlpus.\n\nPerhaps from another angle.\n\nWe have x is sogjpus, and sogjpus is favkpus, but we need to see if favkpus is connected to babbpus.\n\nAnother point: yaqdpus is babbpus, and yaqdpus is part of xowypus, etc.\n\nBut how to connect favkpus to yaqdpus?\n\nLet's list all statements that might connect.\n\nI see that yisdpus is xowypus and nahkpus, and xowypus is yaqdpus and jidppus, so yisdpus is xowypus, so yisdpus is yaqdpus? Since xowypus is yaqdpus, but yisdpus is xowypus, so yisdpus belongs to xowypus, which includes yaqdpus, so indirectly, yisdpus might be yaqdpus? But since \"is\" means belongs to category, it might not be direct equality.\n\nSimilarly, tarfpus is yisdpus, so tarfpus is yisdpus, which is xowypus, which is yaqdpus, so tarfpus is yaqdpus? But yaqdpus is babbpus, so tarfpus is babbpus? But we need sogjpus to babbpus.\n\nBut let's see if tarfpus is connected to favkpus.\n\nFrom the chain I thought earlier, but I need a valid chain.\n\nLet's start from yaqdpus is babbpus.\n\nyaqdpus is part of xowypus? xowypus is yaqdpus and jidppus, so xowypus contains yaqdpus, so yaqdpus is a type of xowypus? Or is it that xowypus is yaqdpus, meaning xowypus belongs to yaqdpus? The notation is \"A is B\" which means A belongs to category B, so if xowypus is yaqdpus, that means xowypus is a type of yaqdpus.\n\nSimilarly, yisdpus is xowypus, so yisdpus is a type of xowypus, which is a type of yaqdpus, so yisdpus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen tarfpus is yisdpus, so tarfpus is yisdpus, which is yaqdpus, so tarfpus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen muqkpus is tarfpus and yolhpus, so muqkpus is tarfpus, which is yaqdpus, so muqkpus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen sorxpus is muqkpus, so sorxpus is muqkpus, which is yaqdpus, so sorxpus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen lenppus is sorxpus and kuhjpus, so lenppus is sorxpus, which is yaqdpus, so lenppus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen xasfpus is lenppus, so xasfpus is lenppus, which is yaqdpus, so xasfpus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen cikjpus is xasfpus, so cikjpus is xasfpus, which is yaqdpus, so cikjpus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen zaxxpus is cikjpus and vayypus, so zaxxpus is cikjpus, which is yaqdpus, so zaxxpus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen rigcpus is zaxxpus and yesvpus, so rigcpus is zaxxpus, which is yaqdpus, so rigcpus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen tupvpus is rigcpus, so tupvpus is rigcpus, which is yaqdpus, so tupvpus is yaqdpus.\n\nAlso, tupvpus is mugnpus and tiwgpus, but that doesn't change that it is yaqdpus.\n\nNow, ravlpus is tupvpus and qiqrpus and wesxpus and welvpus, so ravlpus is tupvpus, which is yaqdpus, so ravlpus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen qifjpus is ravlpus, so qifjpus is ravlpus, which is yaqdpus, so qifjpus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen womlpus is qifjpus and gaknpus, so womlpus is qifjpus, which is yaqdpus, so womlpus is yaqdpus.\n\nNow, we have sovspus is womlpus? Is that stated? No, we have womlpus is qifjpus, but not that sovspus is womlpus.\n\nWe need to connect to favkpus.\n\nfavkpus is sovspus and sacnpus. So if we can show that sovspus is womlpus, then favkpus is sovspus, so favkpus is womlpus, which is yaqdpus, so favkpus is yaqdpus, which is babbpus.\n\nBut is sovspus is womlpus? From the given, I don't see that statement.\n\nLet's look at the given information again.\n\nI see: \"sovspus is womlpus\" is not directly said. But we have \"favkpus is sovspus\" and also from another path? \n\nPerhaps from cafgpus.\n\nfavkpus is cafgpus, and cafgpus is winjpus, but winjpus is not connected to yaqdpus.\n\nAnother thought: we have \"favkpus is sovspus\" and we need to know what sovspus is.\n\nIs there any statement about sovspus? From the list, I don't see any other statement about sovspus except that it is related to favkpus.\n\nBut in the chain, we have womlpus, which is connected to qifjpus, etc., but not to sovspus.\n\nPerhaps I missed a statement.\n\nLet's read the given information carefully:\n\n\"ketqpus is tegzpus and fuphpus. sogjpus is favkpus and qutrpus. tarfpus is yisdpus. mugnpus is luvppus. vuylpus is qapxpus and tebvpus. mehlpus is vuylpus and kopnpus. tupvpus is mugnpus and tiwgpus. lehbpus is nicfpus and nozppus. tupvpus is rigcpus. ravlpus is tupvpus and qiqrpus and wesxpus and welvpus. mugnpus is mehlpus. hirgpus is ketqpus. hirgpus is femzpus. tegzpus is fukwpus. qapxpus is lehbpus. rigcpus is zaxxpus and yesvpus. cikjpus is xasfpus. cafgpus is winjpus. yaqdpus is babbpus. womlpus is qifjpus and gaknpus. zaxxpus is cikjpus and vayypus. xowypus is yaqdpus and jidppus. tegzpus is mukrpus. sorxpus is muqkpus. x is sogjpus. sovspus is womlpus. favkpus is sovspus and sacnpus. muqkpus is tarfpus and yolhpus. nicfpus is hirgpus and zivtpus. yaqdpus is jamwpus. favkpus is cafgpus. yisdpus is xowypus and nahkpus. xasfpus is lenppus. qifjpus is ravlpus. lenppus is sorxpus and kuhjpus.\"\n\nAh! I missed it: \"sovspus is womlpus\" is actually stated! In the list: \"sovspus is womlpus.\" Yes, it is there.\n\nSo, from above: sovspus is womlpus.\n\nAnd from earlier, womlpus is yaqdpus (since womlpus is qifjpus, and qifjpus is ravlpus, etc., up to yaqdpus).\n\nSo, sovspus is womlpus, and womlpus is yaqdpus, so sovspus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen, favkpus is sovspus, so favkpus is sovspus, which is yaqdpus, so favkpus is yaqdpus.\n\nAnd yaqdpus is babbpus, so favkpus is babbpus.\n\nNow, sogjpus is favkpus, so sogjpus is favkpus, which is babbpus, so sogjpus is babbpus.\n\nAnd since x is sogjpus, so x is sogjpus, which is babbpus, so x is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check if all links are valid.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. x is sogjpus. (given)\n\n2. sogjpus is favkpus. (given)\n\n3. favkpus is sovspus. (from \"favkpus is sovspus and sacnpus\")\n\n4. sovspus is womlpus. (given)\n\n5. womlpus is qifjpus and gaknpus. (given) but we need womlpus is yaqdpus? Actually, we need to connect womlpus to yaqdpus through the chain.\n\nFrom step 4, sovspus is womlpus, but we need womlpus to be yaqdpus.\n\nFrom earlier derivation:\n\nwomlpus is qifjpus. (from \"womlpus is qifjpus and gaknpus\")\n\nqifjpus is ravlpus. (given)\n\nravlpus is tupvpus. (from \"ravlpus is tupvpus and ...\")\n\ntupvpus is rigcpus. (given)\n\nrigcpus is zaxxpus. (from \"rigcpus is zaxxpus and yesvpus\")\n\nzaxxpus is cikjpus. (from \"zaxxpus is cikjpus and vayypus\")\n\ncikjpus is xasfpus. (given)\n\nxasfpus is lenppus. (given)\n\nlenppus is sorxpus. (from \"lenppus is sorxpus and kuhjpus\")\n\nsorxpus is muqkpus. (given)\n\nmuqkpus is tarfpus. (from \"muqkpus is tarfpus and yolhpus\")\n\ntarfpus is yisdpus. (given)\n\nyisdpus is xowypus. (from \"yisdpus is xowypus and nahkpus\")\n\nxowypus is yaqdpus. (from \"xowypus is yaqdpus and jidppus\")\n\nSo, since womlpus is qifjpus, and qifjpus is ravlpus, and so on, down to yaqdpus, therefore womlpus is yaqdpus.\n\nThus, from step 4, sovspus is womlpus, so sovspus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen favkpus is sovspus, so favkpus is yaqdpus.\n\nAnd yaqdpus is babbpus, so favkpus is babbpus.\n\nThen sogjpus is favkpus, so sogjpus is babbpus.\n\nThus x is babbpus.\n\nSo, it is true.",

(given)\n\n2. sogjpus is favkpus. (given)\n\n3. favkpus is sovspus. (from \"favkpus is sovspus and sacnpus\")\n\n4. sovspus is womlpus. (given)\n\n5. womlpus is qifjpus and gaknpus. (given) but we need womlpus is yaqdpus? Actually, we need to connect womlpus to yaqdpus through the chain.\n\nFrom step 4, sovspus is womlpus, but we need womlpus to be yaqdpus.\n\nFrom earlier derivation:\n\nwomlpus is qifjpus. (from \"womlpus is qifjpus and gaknpus\")\n\nqifjpus is ravlpus. (given)\n\nravlpus is tupvpus. (from \"ravlpus is tupvpus and ...\")\n\ntupvpus is rigcpus. (given)\n\nrigcpus is zaxxpus. (from \"rigcpus is zaxxpus and yesvpus\")\n\nzaxxpus is cikjpus. (from \"zaxxpus is cikjpus and vayypus\")\n\ncikjpus is xasfpus. (given)\n\nxasfpus is lenppus. (given)\n\nlenppus is sorxpus. (from \"lenppus is sorxpus and kuhjpus\")\n\nsorxpus is muqkpus. (given)\n\nmuqkpus is tarfpus. (from \"muqkpus is tarfpus and yolhpus\")\n\ntarfpus is yisdpus. (given)\n\nyisdpus is xowypus. (from \"yisdpus is xowypus and nahkpus\")\n\nxowypus is yaqdpus. (from \"xowypus is yaqdpus and jidppus\")\n\nSo, since womlpus is qifjpus, and qifjpus is ravlpus, and so on, down to yaqdpus, therefore womlpus is yaqdpus.\n\nThus, from step 4, sovspus is womlpus, so sovspus is yaqdpus.\n\nThen favkpus is sovspus, so favkpus is yaqdpus.\n\nAnd yaqdpus is babbpus, so favkpus is babbpus.\n\nThen sogjpus is favkpus, so sogjpus is babbpus.\n\nThus x is babbpus.\n\nSo, it is true.",

For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, it is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

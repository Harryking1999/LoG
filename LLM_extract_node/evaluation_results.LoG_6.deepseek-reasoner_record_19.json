  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus or babrpus or babspus. The question is asking if x belongs to any of these categories: babgpus, babrpus, or babspus.\n\nFrom the given information, I know that x is zohgpus. The statement says: \"x is zohgpus.\" So, x belongs to zohgpus.\n\nNow, I need to find out what zohgpus is. Looking at the information: \"zohgpus is kobvpus and nehgpus.\" This means zohgpus belongs to kobvpus and also to nehgpus. But since we're dealing with categories, it might mean that zohgpus is a subset of both kobvpus and nehgpus, or perhaps it's a member of both. The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so it's about membership or containment.\n\nI need to trace the relationships to see if x is connected to babgpus or the others.\n\nLet me list out all the given statements:\n\n1. seljpus is jefypus.\n\n2. lucypus is jutdpus and lurmpus.\n\n3. kizcpus is lahkpus.\n\n4. yabmpus is babgpus and luzrpus.\n\n5. kokxpus is yabmpus.\n\n6. kenzpus is kizcpus and katfpus.\n\n7. kadkpus is bagqpus.\n\n8. maplpus is sasqpus and reqypus.\n\n9. zahbpus is hatkpus.\n\n10. zohgpus is kobvpus and nehgpus.\n\n11. jefypus is kadkpus and dacxpus.\n\n12. tujbpus is gitfpus and mujvpus.\n\n13. vexnpus is lucypus.\n\n14. hatkpus is metqpus.\n\n15. jutdpus is zahbpus.\n\n16. xunjpus is vexnpus.\n\n17. yarkpus is forwpus.\n\n18. lahkpus is seljpus.\n\n19. rezspus is xunjpus and gajkpus.\n\n20. qibbpus is kenzpus and nekwpus.\n\n21. vijwpus is kokxpus.\n\n22. sasqpus is tujbpus.\n\n23. raygpus is maplpus.\n\n24. kamkpus is vijwpus and jusdpus.\n\n25. metqpus is kamkpus.\n\n26. x is zohgpus.\n\n27. forwpus is qibbpus.\n\n28. bagqpus is lehnpus.\n\n29. lehnpus is rezspus.\n\n30. kobvpus is raygpus and wusjpus.\n\n31. gitfpus is yarkpus.\n\nAnd from the question, we have babgpus, babrpus, and babspus. But babrpus and babspus are not mentioned in the given information. Only babgpus is mentioned in statement 4: yabmpus is babgpus and luzrpus.\n\nSo, I need to see if x is related to babgpus. Since babrpus and babspus are not defined, it might be unknown for them, but I need to check for babgpus.\n\nx is zohgpus, so I need to trace zohgpus to see if it leads to babgpus.\n\nLet me start from x: x is zohgpus.\n\nzohgpus is kobvpus and nehgpus. So x belongs to kobvpus and nehgpus.\n\nNow, kobvpus is raygpus and wusjpus. So kobvpus belongs to raygpus and wusjpus. Therefore, since x is zohgpus which is kobvpus, x also belongs to raygpus and wusjpus.\n\nraygpus is maplpus. So raygpus belongs to maplpus, so x belongs to maplpus through raygpus.\n\nmaplpus is sasqpus and reqypus. So maplpus belongs to sasqpus and reqypus.\n\nsasqpus is tujbpus. So sasqpus belongs to tujbpus.\n\ntujbpus is gitfpus and mujvpus. So tujbpus belongs to gitfpus and mujvpus.\n\ngitfpus is yarkpus. So gitfpus belongs to yarkpus.\n\nyarkpus is forwpus. So yarkpus belongs to forwpus.\n\nforwpus is qibbpus. So forwpus belongs to qibbpus.\n\nqibbpus is kenzpus and nekwpus. So qibbpus belongs to kenzpus and nekwpus.\n\nkenzpus is kizcpus and katfpus. So kenzpus belongs to kizcpus and katfpus.\n\nkizcpus is lahkpus. So kizcpus belongs to lahkpus.\n\nlahkpus is seljpus. So lahkpus belongs to seljpus.\n\nseljpus is jefypus. So seljpus belongs to jefypus.\n\njefypus is kadkpus and dacxpus. So jefypus belongs to kadkpus and dacxpus.\n\nkadkpus is bagqpus. So kadkpus belongs to bagqpus.\n\nbagqpus is lehnpus. So bagqpus belongs to lehnpus.\n\nlehnpus is rezspus. So lehnpus belongs to rezspus.\n\nrezspus is xunjpus and gajkpus. So rezspus belongs to xunjpus and gajkpus.\n\nxunjpus is vexnpus. So xunjpus belongs to vexnpus.\n\nvexnpus is lucypus. So vexnpus belongs to lucypus.\n\nlucypus is jutdpus and lurmpus. So lucypus belongs to jutdpus and lurmpus.\n\njutdpus is zahbpus. So jutdpus belongs to zahbpus.\n\nzahbpus is hatkpus. So zahbpus belongs to hatkpus.\n\nhatkpus is metqpus. So hatkpus belongs to metqpus.\n\nmetqpus is kamkpus. So metqpus belongs to kamkpus.\n\nkamkpus is vijwpus and jusdpus. So kamkpus belongs to vijwpus and jusdpus.\n\nvijwpus is kokxpus. So vijwpus belongs to kokxpus.\n\nkokxpus is yabmpus. So kokxpus belongs to yabmpus.\n\nyabmpus is babgpus and luzrpus. So yabmpus belongs to babgpus and luzrpus.\n\nSo, from this chain, I see that eventually, through a long path, we reach yabmpus which is babgpus. But I need to see if x is connected to yabmpus or babgpus.\n\nI have x going through zohgpus, kobvpus, raygpus, maplpus, sasqpus, tujbpus, gitfpus, yarkpus, forwpus, qibbpus, kenzpus, kizcpus, lahkpus, seljpus, jefypus, kadkpus, bagqpus, lehnpus, rezspus, xunjpus, vexnpus, lucypus, jutdpus, zahbpus, hatkpus, metqpus, kamkpus, vijwpus, kokxpus, to yabmpus, and then to babgpus.\n\nBut is this path valid? I need to ensure that the connections are consistent and that I'm not missing anything.\n\nAlso, I have nehgpus from zohgpus, but I haven't used nehgpus yet. Similarly, there are other branches like wusjpus from kobvpus, but I didn't follow that because it might not lead to babgpus.\n\nFrom the chain above, I followed the path through raygpus, which led to maplpus, and so on, eventually to yabmpus.\n\nBut let me confirm if this path is correct.\n\nFrom x: x is zohgpus\n\nzohgpus is kobvpus and nehgpus → so x is kobvpus\n\nkobvpus is raygpus and wusjpus → so x is raygpus\n\nraygpus is maplpus → so x is maplpus\n\nmaplpus is sasqpus and reqypus → so x is sasqpus (and reqypus, but I'll follow sasqpus)\n\nsasqpus is tujbpus → so x is tujbpus\n\ntujbpus is gitfpus and mujvpus → so x is gitfpus (and mujvpus)\n\ngitfpus is yarkpus → so x is yarkpus\n\nyarkpus is forwpus → so x is forwpus\n\nforwpus is qibbpus → so x is qibbpus\n\nqibbpus is kenzpus and nekwpus → so x is kenzpus (and nekwpus)\n\nkenzpus is kizcpus and katfpus → so x is kizcpus (and katfpus)\n\nkizcpus is lahkpus → so x is lahkpus\n\nlahkpus is seljpus → so x is seljpus\n\nseljpus is jefypus → so x is jefypus\n\njefypus is kadkpus and dacxpus → so x is kadkpus (and dacxpus)\n\nkadkpus is bagqpus → so x is bagqpus\n\nbagqpus is lehnpus → so x is lehnpus\n\nlehnpus is rezspus → so x is rezspus\n\nrezspus is xunjpus and gajkpus → so x is xunjpus (and gajkpus)\n\nxunjpus is vexnpus → so x is vexnpus\n\nvexnpus is lucypus → so x is lucypus\n\nlucypus is jutdpus and lurmpus → so x is jutdpus (and lurmpus)\n\njutdpus is zahbpus → so x is zahbpus\n\nzahbpus is hatkpus → so x is hatkpus\n\nhatkpus is metqpus → so x is metqpus\n\nmetqpus is kamkpus → so x is kamkpus\n\nkamkpus is vijwpus and jusdpus → so x is vijwpus (and jusdpus)\n\nvijwpus is kokxpus → so x is kokxpus\n\nkokxpus is yabmpus → so x is yabmpus\n\nyabmpus is babgpus and luzrpus → so x is babgpus\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus.\n\nSo, for the question: is x babgpus or babrpus or babspus? Since x is babgpus, it is true that x is babgpus.\n\nThe question says \"or\", so if x is babgpus, then it is true.\n\nNow, what about babrpus and babspus? They are not mentioned anywhere, so probably x is not those, but since the question is \"or\", if one is true, the whole statement is true.\n\nSo, based on this, x is babgpus, so the statement \"x is babgpus or babrpus or babspus\" is true.\n\nBut let me double-check if I missed any alternative paths or if there is any contradiction.\n\nI also have the nehgpus part from zohgpus, but I didn't use it because I followed kobvpus which led to raygpus, and that seemed to connect through. But if I follow nehgpus, what is nehgpus? From the given information, nehgpus is only mentioned in zohgpus is kobvpus and nehgpus, but there is no other definition for nehgpus. So, nehgpus might be a terminal category or something, but it doesn't lead to babgpus, so it doesn't affect the conclusion.\n\nSimilarly, wusjpus from kobvpus is not defined, so it doesn't lead to babgpus.\n\nTherefore, the path I followed is correct, and x is indeed babgpus.\n\nThus, the answer should be true.\n\nThe question is to box the answer.\n\nSo, final answer is true.",

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, final answer is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus. From the given information, x is mowkpus. So, x belongs to mowkpus.\n\nNow, I need to see if mowkpus is connected to babgpus. Looking at the information, kokxpus is babgpus. And muwvpus is kokxpus, which means muwvpus belongs to kokxpus, and since kokxpus is babgpus, muwvpus is also babgpus? But let's be careful: \"is\" here means belongs to category, not equality.\n\nSo, if A is B, and B is C, then A is C? Not necessarily, because if B is a category, and A belongs to B, and B belongs to C, then A should belong to C? But in set theory, if B is a subset of C, and A is an element of B, then A is an element of C. But here, \"is\" might imply subset or element relation.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, it could be that A is an instance of B, or A is a subset of B. I need to clarify.\n\nFrom the examples: muwvpus is kokxpus. kokxpus is zettpus. So, if muwvpus is kokxpus, and kokxpus is zettpus, then muwvpus should be zettpus? But let's see if that's implied.\n\nSimilarly, hatwpus is luwlpus, and hatwpus is bamxpus, but that doesn't necessarily mean luwlpus is bamxpus, because hatwpus might belong to multiple categories.\n\nBut for inheritance, if A is B and B is C, then A is C only if \"is\" is transitive for categories.\n\nThe note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B. So, if A is contained in B, and B is contained in C, then A is contained in C. So, yes, it should be transitive.\n\nSimilarly, if A belongs to B, and B is a category that is contained in C, then A belongs to C.\n\nSo, I think we can assume transitivity.\n\nNow, back to x: x is mowkpus.\n\nmowkpus is gofgpus and yiqwpus. So mowkpus belongs to gofgpus and also to yiqwpus? The statement says \"mowkpus is gofgpus and yiqwpus\". This might mean that mowkpus is contained in gofgpus and also contained in yiqwpus? Or does it mean that mowkpus is a category that includes gofgpus and yiqwpus? No, from the syntax, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if \"mowkpus is gofgpus and yiqwpus\", it probably means mowkpus belongs to gofgpus and also belongs to yiqwpus. But that might be ambiguous.\n\nLet's look at other statements. For example, \"vakrpus is fezmpus and yarhpus and pigcpus.\" This means vakrpus belongs to fezmpus, yarhpus, and pigcpus. Similarly, \"qigbpus is lihkpus and zuqvpus and xocqpus.\" So, when multiple categories are listed, it means A belongs to each of them.\n\nSo for mowkpus, it is gofgpus and yiqwpus, meaning mowkpus belongs to gofgpus and to yiqwpus.\n\nBut we need to see if x is babgpus. Since x is mowkpus, and mowkpus belongs to gofgpus, etc., we need to trace to babgpus.\n\nbabgpus is mentioned: kokxpus is babgpus. So kokxpus belongs to babgpus.\n\nNow, we need to see if x is connected to kokxpus or babgpus.\n\nFrom the information, we have bamxpus is muwvpus. And muwvpus is kokxpus. And kokxpus is zettpus and also kokxpus is babgpus.\n\nBut we need x to be babgpus.\n\nx is mowkpus.\n\nmowkpus is gofgpus and yiqwpus.\n\ngofgpus is qigbpus. So gofgpus belongs to qigbpus.\n\nqigbpus is lihkpus and zuqvpus and xocqpus.\n\nlihkpus is ciwjpus. So lihkpus belongs to ciwjpus.\n\nciwjpus is daxtpus. So ciwjpus belongs to daxtpus.\n\ndaxtpus is gercpus and wimrpus and ceqspus.\n\ngercpus is jacypus. So gercpus belongs to jacypus.\n\njacypus is mujlpus and cakqpus.\n\nmujlpus is yogqpus. So mujlpus belongs to yogqpus.\n\nyogqpus is quqmpus and pazjpus.\n\nquqmpus is yinvpus. So quqmpus belongs to yinvpus.\n\nyinvpus is vizbpus and lizgpus.\n\nvizbpus is vakrpus. So vizbpus belongs to vakrpus.\n\nvakrpus is fezmpus and yarhpus and pigcpus.\n\nfezmpus is cellpus. So fezmpus belongs to cellpus.\n\ncellpus is hatwpus. So cellpus belongs to hatwpus.\n\nhatwpus is luwlpus and also hatwpus is bamxpus.\n\nbamxpus is muwvpus. So bamxpus belongs to muwvpus.\n\nmuwvpus is kokxpus. So muwvpus belongs to kokxpus.\n\nkokxpus is zettpus and also kokxpus is babgpus.\n\nSo, from this, we have a chain from x to babgpus? Let's see if we can connect x to babgpus.\n\nx is mowkpus.\n\nmowkpus is gofgpus.\n\ngofgpus is qigbpus.\n\nqigbpus is lihkpus.\n\nlihkpus is ciwjpus.\n\nciwjpus is daxtpus.\n\ndaxtpus is gercpus.\n\ngercpus is jacypus.\n\njacypus is mujlpus.\n\nmujlpus is yogqpus.\n\nyogqpus is quqmpus.\n\nquqmpus is yinvpus.\n\nyinvpus is vizbpus.\n\nvizbpus is vakrpus.\n\nvakrpus is fezmpus.\n\nfezmpus is cellpus.\n\ncellpus is hatwpus.\n\nhatwpus is bamxpus.\n\nbamxpus is muwvpus.\n\nmuwvpus is kokxpus.\n\nkokxpus is babgpus.\n\nSo, since each \"is\" implies belonging, and transitivity holds, we can say that x is babgpus.\n\nLet me write the chain step by step:\n\n1. x is mowkpus\n\n2. mowkpus is gofgpus → so x is gofgpus\n\n3. gofgpus is qigbpus → so x is qigbpus\n\n4. qigbpus is lihkpus → so x is lihkpus\n\n5. lihkpus is ciwjpus → so x is ciwjpus\n\n6. ciwjpus is daxtpus → so x is daxtpus\n\n7. daxtpus is gercpus → so x is gercpus\n\n8. gercpus is jacypus → so x is jacypus\n\n9. jacypus is mujlpus → so x is mujlpus\n\n10. mujlpus is yogqpus → so x is yogqpus\n\n11. yogqpus is quqmpus → so x is quqmpus? Wait, no: yogqpus is quqmpus and pazjpus, so yogqpus belongs to quqmpus and to pazjpus. So since x is yogqpus, x belongs to quqmpus and to pazjpus.\n\nBut we need to go to yinvpus. quqmpus is yinvpus, so quqmpus belongs to yinvpus. Since x belongs to quqmpus, and quqmpus belongs to yinvpus, then x belongs to yinvpus.\n\nSimilarly, from there to vizbpus, etc.\n\nSo let's continue from x being quqmpus? Actually, from step 10, x is yogqpus, and yogqpus is quqmpus, so x is quqmpus.\n\nThen 12. quqmpus is yinvpus → so x is yinvpus\n\n13. yinvpus is vizbpus and lizgpus → so x is vizbpus and x is lizgpus\n\nWe need vizbpus for the chain.\n\n14. vizbpus is vakrpus → so x is vakrpus\n\n15. vakrpus is fezmpus and yarhpus and pigcpus → so x is fezmpus, etc.\n\n16. fezmpus is cellpus → so x is cellpus\n\n17. cellpus is hatwpus → so x is hatwpus\n\n18. hatwpus is bamxpus → so x is bamxpus? Wait, hatwpus is luwlpus and also hatwpus is bamxpus. So since x is hatwpus, x belongs to bamxpus and to luwlpus.\n\nSo x is bamxpus.\n\n19. bamxpus is muwvpus → so x is muwvpus\n\n20. muwvpus is kokxpus → so x is kokxpus\n\n21. kokxpus is babgpus → so x is babgpus\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus.\n\nSo, it is true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other paths or if I missed something.\n\nAlso, note that kokxpus is zettpus, but that doesn't affect since we need babgpus.\n\nAnd from the chain, we have x is kokxpus, and kokxpus is babgpus, so directly x is babgpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.",

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

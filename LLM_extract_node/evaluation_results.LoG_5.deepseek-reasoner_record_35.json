(This probably means disfpus is contained in both hovnpus and witypus, or perhaps disfpus is a subset of hovnpus and also of witypus? But from the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so A is an element of B? Or could it be that A is a subset? The note says \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\", which might imply that A is a member of B, but in set theory, \"contained\" might mean subset. I need to clarify.\n\nThe note: \"'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'\", so it could be that A is an instance of B or A is a subset of B. But in the context, since we're dealing with categories, it might be that \"is\" indicates membership or subset relation.\n\nLooking at the question: \"x is babcpus?\" and x is defined as \"x is xaylpus and tupvpus\". So x is both xaylpus and tupvpus, meaning x belongs to both categories.\n\nSimilarly, other statements like \"disfpus is hovnpus and witypus\" might mean that disfpus belongs to both hovnpus and witypus.\n\nBut let's list all the given statements clearly:\n\n- meddpus is xubvpus.\n\n- xubvpus is disfpus.\n\n- disfpus is hovnpus and witypus.  // so disfpus belongs to hovnpus and also to witypus\n\n- xaylpus is meddpus.\n\n- pehzpus is babcpus and ristpus.  // pehzpus belongs to babcpus and to ristpus\n\n- dunmpus is xixkpus and zathpus.  // dunmpus belongs to xixkpus and zathpus\n\n- hovnpus is pehzpus.  // hovnpus belongs to pehzpus? That seems odd because earlier we have disfpus is hovnpus, which might mean disfpus is in hovnpus, but now hovnpus is pehzpus, so if hovnpus is in pehzpus, then disfpus is in hovnpus which is in pehzpus, so disfpus is in pehzpus indirectly.\n\nBut let's see the last two:\n\n- x is xaylpus and tupvpus.  // x belongs to xaylpus and to tupvpus\n\n- hovnpus is dunmpus.  // hovnpus belongs to dunmpus\n\nAlso, from the list: \"hovnpus is pehzpus\" and \"hovnpus is dunmpus\" – so hovnpus belongs to both pehzpus and dunmpus.\n\nNow, the question is: is x is babcpus? Meaning, does x belong to babcpus?\n\nI need to trace the relationships to see if x is connected to babcpus.\n\nFirst, x is xaylpus and tupvpus. But we don't have direct information about tupvpus, so I might ignore tupvpus for now since we care about babcpus.\n\nx is xaylpus, and xaylpus is meddpus. So x belongs to xaylpus, and xaylpus belongs to meddpus, so x belongs to meddpus? Since x is xaylpus, and xaylpus is meddpus, that means xaylpus is contained in meddpus, so if x is in xaylpus, then x is in meddpus.\n\nSimilarly, meddpus is xubvpus, so meddpus is contained in xubvpus, so x is in meddpus which is in xubvpus, so x is in xubvpus.\n\nxubvpus is disfpus, so xubvpus is contained in disfpus, so x is in disfpus.\n\ndisfpus is hovnpus and witypus, so disfpus is contained in hovnpus and in witypus. Therefore, x is in disfpus which is in hovnpus, so x is in hovnpus.\n\nNow, hovnpus is pehzpus. So hovnpus is contained in pehzpus? From the statement \"hovnpus is pehzpus\", it means hovnpus belongs to pehzpus, so hovnpus is an element of pehzpus or a subset? Since pehzpus is a category, likely hovnpus is a subset of pehzpus or a member.\n\nBut also, pehzpus is babcpus and ristpus, meaning pehzpus is contained in babcpus and in ristpus. So if hovnpus is in pehzpus, and pehzpus is in babcpus, then hovnpus is in babcpus, and since x is in hovnpus, x is in babcpus.\n\nBut we have another statement: hovnpus is dunmpus. So hovnpus is contained in dunmpus? But dunmpus is xixkpus and zathpus, which might not relate to babcpus directly.\n\nBut for x to be in babcpus, we need to see if x is in pehzpus or directly in babcpus.\n\nFrom above: x is in hovnpus, and hovnpus is in pehzpus, so x is in pehzpus. And since pehzpus is in babcpus, so x is in babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus.\n\nBut let's confirm all steps.\n\nList the chain:\n\n1. x is xaylpus. (given)\n\n2. xaylpus is meddpus.

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, I think it's true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

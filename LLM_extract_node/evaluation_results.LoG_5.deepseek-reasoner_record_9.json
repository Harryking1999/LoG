  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is either babcpus or babrpus based on the given information. The information defines relationships where something \"is\" a category, meaning it belongs to that category.\n\nLet me list out all the given statements:\n\n1. hojhpus is befzpus and nokppus.\n\n2. x is yayppus.\n\n3. defrpus is saztpus and fimjpus.\n\n4. jimvpus is nocfpus.\n\n5. saztpus is lecbpus.\n\n6. befzpus is paxtpus and wugfpus.\n\n7. lecbpus is xoxcpus.\n\n8. paxtpus is jimvpus.\n\n9. zottpus is defrpus.\n\n10. yayppus is hojhpus and jetrpus.\n\n11. xoxcpus is qemhpus and xakhpus.\n\n12. helwpus is babcpus and dunxpus.\n\n13. nocfpus is zottpus and xeyfpus and xotjpus.\n\n14. qemhpus is helwpus and vicqpus.\n\nI need to find if x is babcpus or babrpus. Note that babrpus isn't mentioned anywhere in the given information, so I might not have any direct link to babrpus. But I need to see if x is babcpus.\n\nx is given as yayppus from statement 2: x is yayppus.\n\nFrom statement 10: yayppus is hojhpus and jetrpus. So yayppus belongs to hojhpus and jetrpus categories. But since x is yayppus, that means x is also in hojhpus and jetrpus? No, let's think carefully.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B. So if x is yayppus, it means x is a member of the yayppus category. Similarly, yayppus is hojhpus and jetrpus, meaning that the category yayppus is a subset of hojhpus and also a subset of jetrpus? Or does it mean that yayppus has properties of both? I need to interpret the relationships.\n\nTypically in such logic, \"A is B\" means that A is a type of B, so B is a broader category. So if A is B, then A is contained in B.\n\nBut here, we have statements like \"yayppus is hojhpus and jetrpus\" which might mean that yayppus is both hojhpus and jetrpus, so yayppus is a subset of hojhpus and also a subset of jetrpus.\n\nSimilarly, for x, since x is yayppus, x is in the yayppus category, which is a subset of hojhpus and jetrpus, so x is also in hojhpus and jetrpus.\n\nBut I need to get to babcpus.\n\nbabcpus is mentioned in statement 12: helwpus is babcpus and dunxpus. So helwpus is a subset of babcpus and also of dunxpus? Or does it mean that helwpus has categories babcpus and dunxpus? I think based on the note, \"helwpus is babcpus\" means that helwpus belongs to babcpus category, so helwpus is a type of babcpus.\n\nSimilarly, from statement 14: qemhpus is helwpus and vicqpus, so qemhpus is a type of helwpus and also of vicqpus.\n\nAnd from statement 11: xoxcpus is qemhpus and xakhpus, so xoxcpus is a type of qemhpus and xakhpus.\n\nAnd from statement 7: lecbpus is xoxcpus, so lecbpus is a type of xoxcpus.\n\nFrom statement 5: saztpus is lecbpus, so saztpus is a type of lecbpus.\n\nFrom statement 3: defrpus is saztpus and fimjpus, so defrpus is a type of saztpus and fimjpus.\n\nFrom statement 9: zottpus is defrpus, so zottpus is a type of defrpus.\n\nFrom statement 13: nocfpus is zottpus and xeyfpus and xotjpus, so nocfpus is a type of zottpus, xeyfpus, and xotjpus.\n\nFrom statement 4: jimvpus is nocfpus, so jimvpus is a type of nocfpus.\n\nFrom statement 8: paxtpus is jimvpus, so paxtpus is a type of jimvpus.\n\nFrom statement 6: befzpus is paxtpus and wugfpus, so befzpus is a type of paxtpus and wugfpus.\n\nFrom statement 1: hojhpus is befzpus and nokppus, so hojhpus is a type of befzpus and nokppus.\n\nBut from statement 10: yayppus is hojhpus and jetrpus, so yayppus is a type of hojhpus and jetrpus.\n\nAnd since x is yayppus, x is a type of yayppus, so x is also a type of hojhpus and jetrpus.\n\nNow, I need to see if x is a type of babcpus.\n\nbabcpus is from helwpus, which is from qemhpus, etc.\n\nSo let's see if we can connect x to babcpus.\n\nx is yayppus, which is hojhpus.\n\nhojhpus is befzpus and nokppus.\n\nbefzpus is paxtpus and wugfpus.\n\npaxtpus is jimvpus.\n\njimvpus is nocfpus.\n\nnocfpus is zottpus and xeyfpus and xotjpus.\n\nzottpus is defrpus.\n\ndefrpus is saztpus and fimjpus.\n\nsaztpus is lecbpus.\n\nlecbpus is xoxcpus.\n\nxoxcpus is qemhpus and xakhpus.\n\nqemhpus is helwpus and vicqpus.\n\nhelwpus is babcpus and dunxpus.\n\nSo, from this chain, we can see that helwpus is a type of babcpus, so anything that is a type of helwpus is also a type of babcpus.\n\nNow, is x a type of helwpus? Let's see the path from x to helwpus.\n\nx is yayppus → yayppus is hojhpus → hojhpus is befzpus → befzpus is paxtpus → paxtpus is jimvpus → jimvpus is nocfpus → nocfpus is zottpus → zottpus is defrpus → defrpus is saztpus → saztpus is lecbpus → lecbpus is xoxcpus → xoxcpus is qemhpus → qemhpus is helwpus.\n\nSo yes, through this long chain, x is ultimately a type of helwpus, and since helwpus is a type of babcpus, x is also a type of babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus.\n\nThe question is: is x is babcpus or babrpus? Since we have that x is babcpus, it is true that x is babcpus or babrpus, because even if babrpus is unknown, the \"or\" is satisfied by babcpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me confirm if there is any ambiguity.\n\nNote that in the chain, we have multiple \"is\" statements, but since each \"is\" indicates belonging to a category, the transitivity should hold: if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nSo, from x is yayppus and yayppus is hojhpus, so x is hojhpus.\n\nThen hojhpus is befzpus, so x is befzpus.\n\nAnd so on, all the way down to x is helwpus, and helwpus is babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus.\n\nSo for the question \"x is babcpus or babrpus?\", since x is babcpus, it is true.\n\nNow, babrpus is not mentioned anywhere, so we don't know if x is babrpus, but since the \"or\" only requires one to be true, it is true.\n\nThus, the answer is true.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nNow, babrpus is not mentioned anywhere, so we don't know if x is babrpus, but since the \"or\" only requires one to be true, it is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

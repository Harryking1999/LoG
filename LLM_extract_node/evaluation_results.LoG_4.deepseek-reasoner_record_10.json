But I don't have information about yenzpus yet, so I might need to focus on xorkpus first since that might connect to others.\n\nFrom statement 8: xorkpus is watppus.\n\nSo x is xorkpus, and xorkpus is watppus, so x is watppus? But remember, \"is\" means belongs to, so if x is xorkpus and xorkpus is watppus, then x belongs to watppus indirectly. Similarly, we can chain these.\n\nSimilarly, from statement 2: watppus is qinspus.\n\nSo since xorkpus is watppus and watppus is qinspus, then xorkpus is qinspus, and thus x is qinspus? Let's be careful.\n\nActually, since x is xorkpus, and xorkpus is watppus, so x belongs to watppus. Then since watppus is qinspus, x belongs to qinspus.\n\nNow from statement 5: qinspus is nagjpus.\n\nSo qinspus is nagjpus, meaning qinspus belongs to nagjpus, so since x belongs to qinspus, x belongs to nagjpus.\n\nNow from statement 1: nagjpus is ruqhpus and camnpus.\n\nSo nagjpus belongs to ruqhpus and camnpus, so x belongs to ruqhpus and camnpus.\n\nNow from statement 7: ruqhpus is pifhpus and dutnpus.\n\nSo ruqhpus belongs to pifhpus and dutnpus, so since x belongs to ruqhpus, x belongs to pifhpus and dutnpus.\n\nNow from statement 10: pifhpus is bepqpus.\n\nSo pifhpus belongs to bepqpus, so x belongs to bepqpus.\n\nNow from statement 4: bepqpus is luwjpus.\n\nSo bepqpus belongs to luwjpus, so x belongs to luwjpus.\n\nNow from statement 9: luwjpus is guczpus.\n\nSo luwjpus belongs to guczpus, so x belongs to guczpus.\n\nNow from statement 6: guczpus is babxpus.\n\nSo guczpus belongs to babxpus, so x belongs to babxpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babxpus.\n\nThe question is whether x is babdpus or babqpus or babxpus. Since x is babxpus, that means it is true that x is one of them, specifically babxpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nI also have the part about yenzpus, but I didn't use it.

Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

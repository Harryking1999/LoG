  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus, babcpus, and babppus. The given information states that \"x is putypus and yemzpus.\" So, x belongs to putypus and yemzpus. But I need to find out if x also belongs to babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nI should trace through the relationships to see if x is connected to these categories.\n\nLet me list out all the relevant statements from the given information.\n\nI know:\n\n- x is putypus and yemzpus.\n\n- putypus is zabrpus. (from \"putypus is zabrpus\")\n\n- zabrpus is xixzpus and nubkpus. (from \"zabrpus is xixzpus and nubkpus\")\n\n- xixzpus is kepqpus and vuhrpus. (from \"xixzpus is kepqpus and vuhrpus\")\n\n- kepqpus is yizqpus. (from \"kepqpus is yizqpus\") but also \"kepqpus is puxkpus and nujjpus\" – this might be multiple categories or perhaps kepqpus has multiple subcategories. Since \"is\" means belongs to category, kepqpus can belong to multiple categories.\n\nSimilarly, I need to find babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nFrom the information:\n\n- sebwpus is babbpus and guvmpus. (from \"sebwpus is babbpus and guvmpus\")\n\n- duffpus is sebwpus. (from \"duffpus is sebwpus\")\n\n- duffpus is yujppus. (from \"duffpus is yujppus\")\n\n- yujppus is babcpus and yaxxpus. (from \"yujppus is babcpus and yaxxpus\")\n\nSo, duffpus is sebwpus, which is babbpus, and duffpus is yujppus, which is babcpus. Therefore, duffpus is both babbpus and babcpus.\n\nNow, for babppus:\n\n- zelkpus is babppus and neybpus. (from \"zelkpus is babppus and neybpus\")\n\n- lupzpus is zelkpus and tivspus.

(from \"wolfpus is darzpus\")\n\n- darzpus is duffpus and peyppus and nefkpus. (from \"darzpus is duffpus and peyppus and nefkpus\")\n\nSo, darzpus includes duffpus, which we already have.\n\nBut I need to see if x is connected to duffpus or zelkpus.\n\nx is putypus, which is zabrpus, which is xixzpus, etc. This seems to be a different chain.\n\nI also have:\n\n- nacxpus is konlpus and madbpus.

(from \"kepqpus is yizqpus\")\n\nBut kepqpus is also puxkpus and nujjpus, but for now, we have kepqpus is yizqpus.\n\nAnd xixzpus is kepqpus and vuhrpus, so xixzpus includes kepqpus, which includes yizqpus, which includes vanspus, which includes bockpus, which includes fextpus, which is kuslpus, which is sajwpus, which is navdpus and huzxpus, and navdpus is xellpus, which is wajjpus and wikdpus, and wajjpus is ruqtpus, which is vijkpus, which is vijwpus, which is xargpus, which is nacxpus, which is konlpus and madbpus, etc.\n\nThis is getting messy.

Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

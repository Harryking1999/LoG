But I need to see if x belongs to babgpus.\n\nbabgpus is mentioned in the context of fogcpus: \"fogcpus is babgpus and fuhnpus and tombpus.\" So fogcpus belongs to babgpus, among other things. But I need to see if x is connected to fogcpus or babgpus.\n\nI should trace the relationships from x to babgpus. Since x is kikzpus, I can start with kikzpus.\n\nFrom the information: \"kikzpus is jallpus.\" and \"jallpus is pikvpus.\" and \"pikvpus is xutqpus.\" and \"xutqpus is lowlpus.\" and also \"xutqpus is riympus.\" but that might not be directly helpful.

Also, x is also yuxjpus, but I don't see yuxjpus connected to anything else, so it might not affect this.\n\nNow, the question is whether x is babgpus. From the chain, since x is kikzpus, and kikzpus eventually leads to fogcpus, which is babgpus, so yes, x should be babgpus.\n\nBut let me confirm the chain step by step.\n\nStart: x is kikzpus (given)\n\nkikzpus is jallpus (given)\n\njallpus is pikvpus (given)\n\npikvpus is xutqpus (given)\n\nxutqpus is lowlpus (given) — also xutqpus is riympus, but that might not be needed.\n\nlowlpus is geqnpus (given)\n\ngeqnpus is wehhpus (given)\n\nwehhpus is wozkpus and kipmpus — so wehhpus belongs to both, so we can take wozkpus.\n\nwozkpus is woctpus (given)\n\nwoctpus is qejmpus (given)\n\nqejmpus is suqfpus (given)\n\nsuqfpus is muxxpus (given)\n\nmuxxpus is xethpus and disxpus — so we can take xethpus.\n\nxethpus is rikppus (given) — also xethpus is tarbpus, but we don't need that.\n\nrikppus is jiqgpus and fotvpus — so we can take jiqgpus.\n\njiqgpus is vibkpus and qobxpus — so we can take vibkpus.\n\nvibkpus is sexgpus (given)\n\nsexgpus is batwpus (given)\n\nbatwpus is jifqpus and pubwpus and vusxpus — so we can take jifqpus.\n\njifqpus is yoqlpus and linnpus — so we can take yoqlpus.\n\nyoqlpus is kothpus (given) — also yoqlpus is rahfpus, but not needed.\n\nkothpus is fogcpus and tulmpus — so we can take fogcpus.\n\nfogcpus is babgpus and fuhnpus and tombpus — so fogcpus is babgpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is kikzpus, and through this chain, kikzpus is babgpus, so x is babgpus.\n\nThe chain seems consistent, and all links are given.\n\nBut is there any other information that might contradict this?

IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo the answer should be true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

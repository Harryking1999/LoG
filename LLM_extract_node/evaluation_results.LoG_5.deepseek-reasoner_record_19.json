The information defines relationships between categories using \"is\" to mean belonging to or containment.\n\nHere's what I know from the given information:\n\n- x is puhvpus and racspus.\n\n- jixypus is coqmpus and julxpus.\n\n- puhvpus is qofmpus.\n\n- qofmpus is serspus.\n\n- coqmpus is gidkpus.\n\n- gidkpus is babcpus and babrpus and qokypus and zovgpus.\n\n- serspus is gapgpus.\n\n- gapgpus is jixypus and wuygpus.\n\nI need to see if x is in babcpus and babrpus. Since babcpus and babrpus are categories under gidkpus, I need to see if x is connected to gidkpus.\n\nLet me trace the path from x to babcpus and babrpus.\n\nStart with x:\n\nx is puhvpus. So x belongs to puhvpus.\n\npuhvpus is qofmpus. So puhvpus is contained in qofmpus.\n\nqofmpus is serspus. So qofmpus is contained in serspus.\n\nserspus is gapgpus. So serspus is contained in gapgpus.\n\ngapgpus is jixypus and wuygpus. So gapgpus contains jixypus and wuygpus.\n\nBut I need to get to gidkpus, which has babcpus and babrpus.\n\ngidkpus is under coqmpus: coqmpus is gidkpus.\n\nAnd jixypus is coqmpus and julxpus. So jixypus belongs to coqmpus.\n\nFrom above, gapgpus contains jixypus, and jixypus is coqmpus, so coqmpus is related to gapgpus through jixypus.\n\nBut I have x going through serspus to gapgpus. Since gapgpus contains jixypus, and jixypus is coqmpus, and coqmpus is gidkpus, and gidkpus contains babcpus and babrpus.\n\nSo, potentially, x might be connected to gidkpus through this chain.\n\nBut I need to see if x itself is in babcpus and babrpus, or if the categories include it.\n\nThe question is \"x is babcpus and babrpus?\" meaning does x belong to both categories.\n\nFrom the chain, x is in puhvpus, which is in qofmpus, which is in serspus, which is in gapgpus. Now, gapgpus contains jixypus, but does gapgpus contain everything under it? Since gapgpus is a category that contains jixypus and wuygpus, but jixypus is itself a category that contains coqmpus? No, let's read carefully.\n\n\"gapgpus is jixypus and wuygpus\" means that gapgpus includes jixypus and wuygpus, so jixypus is a subset of gapgpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"jixypus is coqmpus and julxpus\" means jixypus includes coqmpus and julxpus, so coqmpus is a subset of jixypus.\n\nThen \"coqmpus is gidkpus\" means coqmpus includes gidkpus, so gidkpus is a subset of coqmpus.\n\nThen \"gidkpus is babcpus and babrpus and qokypus and zovgpus\" means gidkpus includes babcpus, babrpus, etc.\n\nSo, for x to be in babcpus, it must be in gidkpus, which requires it to be in coqmpus, which requires it to be in jixypus, which requires it to be in gapgpus.\n\nBut from x, we have x in serspus, and serspus is gapgpus, meaning serspus is contained in gapgpus? Let's see the statements.\n\n\"serspus is gapgpus\" – this means serspus belongs to gapgpus, so serspus is a subset of gapgpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"gapgpus is jixypus and wuygpus\" – this means gapgpus contains jixypus and wuygpus, so jixypus ⊆ gapgpus and wuygpus ⊆ gapgpus.\n\nBut from x, x is in serspus, and since serspus ⊆ gapgpus, so x is in gapgpus.\n\nNow, gapgpus contains jixypus, so x might be in jixypus? Not necessarily. Because gapgpus contains jixypus, but that doesn't mean that every member of gapgpus is in jixypus; it means that jixypus is a part of gapgpus, so there are elements in jixypus that are in gapgpus, but gapgpus may have other elements like wuygpus.\n\nSo, x is in gapgpus, but we don't know if x is specifically in jixypus or in wuygpus.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that x is in jixypus.\n\nSince we need x to be in jixypus to eventually get to coqmpus and gidkpus, but we don't have that link.\n\nLet's list the containment hierarchy.\n\nFrom the given:\n\n- puhvpus ⊆ qofmpus (since puhvpus is qofmpus)\n\n- qofmpus ⊆ serspus (qofmpus is serspus)\n\n- serspus ⊆ gapgpus (serspus is gapgpus)\n\n- gapgpus ⊇ jixypus and gapgpus ⊇ wuygpus (gapgpus is jixypus and wuygpus)\n\n- jixypus ⊇ coqmpus and jixypus ⊇ julxpus (jixypus is coqmpus and julxpus)\n\n- coqmpus ⊇ gidkpus (coqmpus is gidkpus)\n\n- gidkpus ⊇ babcpus and gidkpus ⊇ babrpus and etc.\n\nx is in puhvpus, so x is in qofmpus, so x is in serspus, so x is in gapgpus.\n\nNow, gapgpus contains jixypus, but x could be in the part of gapgpus that is not jixypus, i.e., it could be in wuygpus.\n\nThere is no information that x is in jixypus. Therefore, we cannot assume that x is in jixypus.\n\nHence, we cannot link x to coqmpus or gidkpus.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that x is in babcpus or babrpus.\n\nThe question is whether x is babcpus and babrpus, which would require x to be in gidkpus, but we don't have evidence for that.\n\nAlso, note that x is also racspus, but there is no information about racspus connecting to anything else, so that doesn't help.\n\nSo, based on the given, it is unknown whether x is in babcpus or babrpus.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be unknown.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any other path.\n\nIs there any connection from serspus to jixypus? From gapgpus, we have jixypus contained in gapgpus, but serspus is contained in gapgpus, so serspus and jixypus are both subsets of gapgpus, but they might be disjoint or overlapping, but we don't know.\n\nSimilarly, no information that serspus is related to jixypus.\n\nSo, indeed, we cannot infer that x is in jixypus.\n\nThus, for x to be in babcpus, it must be in gidkpus, which requires being in coqmpus, which requires being in jixypus, but we don't have that.\n\nSo, unknown.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nFirst, I need to determine if x is both babcpus and babrpus based on the given information.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

  "reasoning_text": "First, the given information is:\n\n- vedtpus is babqpus.\n\n- vedtpus is veznpus.\n\n- x is vedtpus and xumqpus.\n\nThe note says that 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B. So, it's about set membership or subset relations.\n\nI need to find out if x is babdpus or babqpus. But babdpus isn't mentioned anywhere in the given information. The question is about \"babdpus or babqpus\". Since babdpus isn't defined, I might need to infer something.\n\nLooking back: \"vedtpus is babqpus\" so babqpus is a category that contains vedtpus.\n\nAlso, \"vedtpus is veznpus\" so veznpus is another category that contains vedtpus.\n\nThen, \"x is vedtpus and xumqpus\" so x belongs to both vedtpus and xumqpus.\n\nThe question is: is x babdpus or babqpus? But babdpus isn't mentioned, so I don't have any information about babdpus. Therefore, I can't say that x is babdpus because there's no relation given.\n\nNow, about babqpus: I know that vedtpus is babqpus, and x is vedtpus, so if vedtpus is contained in babqpus, and x is in vedtpus, then x should also be in babqpus. That makes sense from set theory: if A is a subset of B, and x is an element of A, then x is an element of B.\n\nSo, since vedtpus is babqpus (meaning vedtpus ⊆ babqpus), and x is vedtpus (meaning x ∈ vedtpus), then x ∈ babqpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babqpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babdpus or babqpus?\" Since x is babqpus, it satisfies the \"or\" condition. So, it should be true that x is babqpus, so the statement \"x is babdpus or babqpus\" is true because one part is true.\n\nBut what about babdpus? I have no information about babdpus, so it might be false or unknown, but since the \"or\" condition only requires one to be true, and we have x is babqpus, so overall, it should be true.\n\nThe question is: \"Is it true or false or unknown: x is babdpus or babqpus?\"\n\nSince x is babqpus, it is true that x is babqpus, so the disjunction is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any trick here. The note says 'A is B' means A belongs to B, so it's membership or subset. In the case of x is vedtpus, it probably means x is an element of vedtpus, since vedtpus is a category.\n\nSimilarly, vedtpus is babqpus, so vedtpus is a subset of babqpus.\n\nSo, yes, x ∈ vedtpus ⊆ babqpus, so x ∈ babqpus.\n\nThus, x is babqpus.\n\nSo, for the question, x is babqpus, so \"x is babdpus or babqpus\" is true.\n\nI don't need to know about babdpus because the or condition is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is true.",

Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

(given)\n\nbuzvpus is bisdpus. (given)\n\nbisdpus is nochpus. (given)\n\nnochpus is cerspus. (given)\n\ncerspus is jukppus and vofdpus. But since we need to go through jukppus, we take jukppus.\n\ncerspus is jukppus, meaning jukppus is a category that contains cerspus, but since we are going from x to babbpus, we need to see the containment chain.\n\nIn this context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if A is B, then A is contained in B.\n\nSo for x, we have x is tintpus, so x is in tintpus category.\n\nBut tintpus is buzvpus, so tintpus is in buzvpus category, meaning x is in buzvpus category indirectly.\n\nSimilarly, buzvpus is bisdpus, so buzvpus is in bisdpus, so x is in bisdpus.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo to find if x is babbpus, we need to see if babbpus is a category that contains x, meaning we need to see if x is in the chain that leads to babbpus.\n\nFrom the chain above, we have a path from x to babbpus through multiple steps.\n\nBut let's confirm if the chain is valid.\n\nFrom jukppus: jukppus is jaxlpus and mozspus. So jukppus is contained in jaxlpus? No.\n\nThe statement \"jukppus is jaxlpus and mozspus\" means that jukppus belongs to jaxlpus and also to mozspus? Or does it mean jukppus is composed of jaxlpus and mozspus?\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B.\n\nSo \"jukppus is jaxlpus\" would mean jukppus is contained in jaxlpus? That seems backward from the typical \"is-a\" relationship.\n\nLet's read the note carefully: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \"\n\nSo if A is B, then A is a member of B, so B is a category that contains A.\n\nFor example, x is tintpus, so tintpus contains x.\n\ntintpus is buzvpus, so buzvpus contains tintpus.\n\nSo in the chain, when we say A is B, it means B contains A.\n\nTherefore, to find if x is babbpus, we need to see if babbpus contains x, meaning if x is in the set of things that babbpus contains.\n\nBut babbpus is a category, and we need to see if x is directly or indirectly contained in babbpus.\n\nFrom the given, we have kivwpus is babbpus and dadypus, meaning kivwpus contains babbpus? Or does it mean kivwpus is contained in babbpus?\n\nThe statement \"kivwpus is babbpus and dadypus\" – according to the note, it means kivwpus belongs to category babbpus and also to dadypus? Or does it mean kivwpus is composed of babbpus and dadypus?\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if A is B, then A is contained in B.\n\nBut here \"kivwpus is babbpus and dadypus\" – this might be ambiguous.\n\nLooking at other examples: \"yesvpus is kivwpus\" which means yesvpus is contained in kivwpus? Or kivwpus contains yesvpus?\n\nFrom \"yesvpus is kivwpus\", and since yesvpus is a category, it means that yesvpus is contained in kivwpus, so kivwpus contains yesvpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"kivwpus is babbpus and dadypus\" – this likely means that kivwpus is contained in babbpus and also contained in dadypus? Or does it mean that babbpus and dadypus are parts of kivwpus?\n\nThe note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so for \"kivwpus is babbpus\", it would mean kivwpus belongs to category babbpus, so babbpus contains kivwpus.\n\nBut then \"kivwpus is babbpus and dadypus\" would mean kivwpus belongs to babbpus and also to dadypus, so babbpus contains kivwpus and dadypus contains kivwpus.\n\nBut that seems odd because usually, we think of categories containing smaller things.\n\nLet's look at the beginning: \"nochpus is cerspus\" which means nochpus belongs to cerspus, so cerspus contains nochpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"cerspus is jukppus and vofdpus\" which means cerspus belongs to jukppus and to vofdpus, so jukppus contains cerspus and vofdpus contains cerspus.\n\nBut then \"jukppus is jaxlpus and mozspus\" means jukppus belongs to jaxlpus and to mozspus, so jaxlpus contains jukppus and mozspus contains jukppus.\n\nThis seems consistent: whenever we say \"A is B\", it means B contains A.\n\nSo for \"kivwpus is babbpus and dadypus\", it means babbpus contains kivwpus and dadypus contains kivwpus.\n\nTherefore, for x to be babbpus, we need babbpus to contain x, but babbpus contains kivwpus, which contains yesvpus, etc., so if x is contained in yesvpus or something, then indirectly babbpus contains x.\n\nBut from the chain, we have x contained in tintpus, which is contained in buzvpus, etc., and eventually through lowypus to yesvpus to kivwpus, and since babbpus contains kivwpus, then babbpus contains kivwpus, which contains yesvpus, which contains... up to x.\n\nSo yes, x is contained in babbpus indirectly.\n\nBut let's make sure the chain is correct.\n\nFrom x: x is tintpus → tintpus is buzvpus → buzvpus is bisdpus → bisdpus is nochpus → nochpus is cerspus → cerspus is jukppus (and vofdpus) → jukppus is jaxlpus (and mozspus) → jaxlpus is jozhpus (and vimwpus and mevjpus and gimvpus) → jozhpus is vodgpus (and hexmpus) → vodgpus is pasdpus (and meggpus and kifgpus) → pasdpus is vowhpus (and perppus) → vowhpus is jemhpus → jemhpus is muvlpus → muvlpus is jeyypus → jeyypus is nejlpus (and toqrpus and dewrpus) → nejlpus is towwpus (and suqvpus) → towwpus is xowypus → xowypus is gaxrpus → gaxrpus is lowypus → lowypus is yesvpus (and jectpus and faqqpus) → yesvpus is kivwpus → kivwpus is babbpus (and dadypus)\n\nSo since kivwpus is contained in babbpus, and yesvpus is contained in kivwpus, and lowypus contains yesvpus, and so on up to x, therefore x is contained in babbpus.\n\nThus, x is babbpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus?\" which means is x contained in babbpus? Yes, from above.\n\nTherefore, it is true.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any missing links or alternatives.\n\nWe also have other statements, but I think this chain is sufficient.\n\nNote that we have \"yesvpus is sejkpus\" and \"sejkpus is zuhlpus\" but zuhlpus is bicdpus and zacwpus, and bicdpus is cisbpus, and cisbpus is qeccpus and mizvpus, but that doesn't seem relevant to getting to babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"yesvpus is noqxpus\" and \"noqxpus is sehypus and batdpus\" but again, not needed.\n\nSo the chain I have seems correct.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.",

Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

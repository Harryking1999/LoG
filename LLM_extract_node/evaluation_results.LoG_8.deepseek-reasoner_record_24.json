But also, huxgpus is gabdpus and kawjpus. So gabdpus is a category.\n\nBut gabdpus is also muswpus and qofspus? No, from given: gabdpus is muswpus and qofspus? Let's see the text: \"gabdpus is muswpus and qofspus.\" But earlier it said \"gabdpus is vodxpus\"? No, I think I misread.\n\nLet's list all statements about gabdpus:\n\nFrom \"gabdpus is vodxpus.\" – that's one.\n\nBut then later: \"gabdpus is muswpus and qofspus.\" – that seems contradictory? But in this context, \"is\" might mean belongs to, so gabdpus belongs to vodxpus, and also gabdpus belongs to muswpus and qofspus? That doesn't make sense because categories might have multiple parents.\n\nPerhaps I need to interpret \"A is B\" as A is a subset of B or something. But let's see the note: \"A is B means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B\". So, it's possible for A to belong to multiple categories.\n\nBut in terms of inheritance, if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nBut for gabdpus, it is said to be vodxpus, and also muswpus and qofspus? That means gabdpus belongs to vodxpus, and also to muswpus, and to qofspus? But that might be okay if vodxpus, muswpus, qofspus are different categories.\n\nBut let's not get distracted. I need to find babbpus and babcpus.\n\nbabbpus is mentioned in: madgpus is babbpus and mukrpus.\n\nAnd babcpus is mentioned in: wokrpus is babcpus and fucrpus.\n\nNow, I need to see if x is connected to madgpus or wokrpus.\n\nFrom x, we have x is rahbpus, and rahbpus is tafwpus, among others.\n\ntafwpus is buydpus and yahhpus.\n\nBut also, from rahbpus, it is tafwpus, so x is tafwpus.\n\nNow, tafwpus is buydpus, so x is buydpus?

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11.

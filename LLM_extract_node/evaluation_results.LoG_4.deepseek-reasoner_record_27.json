Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8.

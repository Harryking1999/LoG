  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the relationships given. The statements are of the form \"A is B\", which means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, it's about set membership or hierarchy.\n\nLet me list out all the statements:\n\n1. fipbpus is suybpus.\n\n2. sejdpus is joqbpus.\n\n3. yixcpus is sejdpus.\n\n4. fuyspus is fipbpus and cahbpus.\n\n5. suybpus is yixcpus.\n\n6. joqbpus is yakbpus.\n\n7. joqbpus is babcpus.\n\n8. jezwpus is fuyspus and dorfpus.\n\n9. x is jezwpus and caqqpus.\n\nThe question is: Is it true or false or unknown that x is babcpus or babrpus or babspus?\n\nI need to find out if x belongs to babcpus, babrpus, or babspus. But note that babrpus and babspus are not mentioned in the given information at all. So, I might not have any information about them.\n\nFocusing on babcpus since it is mentioned: from statement 7, joqbpus is babcpus. That means joqbpus belongs to babcpus.\n\nNow, I need to see if x is connected to joqbpus or babcpus.\n\nLet me trace the relationships from x backwards.\n\nFrom statement 9: x is jezwpus and caqqpus. So x belongs to jezwpus and also to caqqpus. But since we're interested in babcpus, I'll focus on the jezwpus part.\n\nFrom statement 8: jezwpus is fuyspus and dorfpus. So jezwpus belongs to fuyspus and to dorfpus.\n\nFrom statement 4: fuyspus is fipbpus and cahbpus. So fuyspus belongs to fipbpus and to cahbpus.\n\nFrom statement 1: fipbpus is suybpus. So fipbpus belongs to suybpus.\n\nFrom statement 5: suybpus is yixcpus. So suybpus belongs to yixcpus.\n\nFrom statement 3: yixcpus is sejdpus. So yixcpus belongs to sejdpus.\n\nFrom statement 2: sejdpus is joqbpus. So sejdpus belongs to joqbpus.\n\nFrom statement 7: joqbpus is babcpus. So joqbpus belongs to babcpus.\n\nTherefore, by transitivity, since sejdpus is joqbpus, and yixcpus is sejdpus, and so on, we can chain up to x.\n\nLet me write the chain:\n\nx is jezwpus (from 9)\n\njezwpus is fuyspus (from 8)\n\nfuyspus is fipbpus (from 4)\n\nfipbpus is suybpus (from 1)\n\nsuybpus is yixcpus (from 5)\n\nyixcpus is sejdpus (from 3)\n\nsejdpus is joqbpus (from 2)\n\njoqbpus is babcpus (from 7)\n\nSo, since each \"is\" means membership, and membership is transitive in the sense that if A is B and B is C, then A is C? But I need to be careful. The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so it's like A ⊆ B or A ∈ B? Actually, in hierarchy, if A is B, it might mean that A is a subset of B or an instance of B. But for transitivity, if A is B and B is C, then A is C only if the relation is transitive. In set theory, if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C. But here, \"A is B\" might mean A is an element of B, which is not transitive. For example, if A is in B and B is in C, then A may not be in C.\n\nI need to clarify the meaning. The note says: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \". The phrase \"contained in\" could mean subset or element. But in common usage in such puzzles, \"is\" often means \"is a type of\" or \"is a subset of\", so transitivity holds.\n\nLook at the statements: for example, from statement 4, fuyspus is fipbpus and cahbpus, which suggests that fuyspus is a type of fipbpus and also a type of cahbpus. Similarly, from statement 8, jezwpus is fuyspus and dorfpus, meaning jezwpus is a type of fuyspus and also a type of dorfpus.\n\nSo, in this context, \"A is B\" means that A is a subtype of B or A is contained in the set B. Therefore, if A is B and B is C, then A is C, because the relation is transitive.\n\nWe can verify with the given: from statement 3, yixcpus is sejdpus, and from statement 2, sejdpus is joqbpus, so yixcpus should be joqbpus. But is that stated? Not directly, but it should follow.\n\nSimilarly, from statement 5, suybpus is yixcpus, and yixcpus is sejdpus, so suybpus is sejdpus, which is consistent because from statement 1, fipbpus is suybpus, and from above, suybpus is sejdpus, so fipbpus is sejdpus, and so on.\n\nSo, yes, transitivity seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, from the chain above, x is jezwpus, which is fuyspus, which is fipbpus, which is suybpus, which is yixcpus, which is sejdpus, which is joqbpus, which is babcpus.\n\nSo, x is babcpus.\n\nThe question is: x is babcpus or babrpus or babspus?\n\nSince x is babcpus, it is true that x is babcpus, so the OR statement is true because one of the conditions is true.\n\nBut what about babrpus and babspus? They are not mentioned, so we don't know if x is babrpus or babspus, but since x is babcpus, the OR is true regardless.\n\nSo, the statement \"x is babcpus or babrpus or babspus\" is true because x is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there is any ambiguity.\n\nAlso, from statement 9, x is also caqqpus, but that doesn't affect this.\n\nAnd from statement 8, jezwpus is also dorfpus, but again, not relevant.\n\nSo, yes, x is babcpus.\n\nThus, for the question, it is true.\n\nThe question says \"or babrpus or babspus\" but since we have no information about babrpus or babspus, but since x is babcpus, the OR is satisfied.\n\nSo, final answer should be true.",

IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, final answer should be true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

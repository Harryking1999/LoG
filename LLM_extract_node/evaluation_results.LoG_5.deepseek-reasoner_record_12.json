So, it's about set membership or hierarchy.\n\nI need to find out if x is babcpus or babrpus or babspus. But from the information, I see babcpus mentioned only once: \"husbpus is babcpus and jugwpus.\" So husbpus belongs to both babcpus and jugwpus.\n\nNow, x is taprpus. So I need to trace where taprpus belongs and see if it leads to babcpus or the others.\n\nLet me list out all the statements:\n\n1. x is taprpus. (so x belongs to taprpus)\n\n2. zusvpus is bowtpus.\n\n3. focnpus is lomzpus.\n\n4. hodbpus is zusvpus.\n\n5. husbpus is babcpus and jugwpus.\n\n6. lomzpus is hodbpus and luplpus.\n\n7. taprpus is focnpus and yiptpus.\n\n8. vowdpus is husbpus.\n\n9. bowtpus is vowdpus.\n\nI need to find if x is in babcpus or babrpus or babspus. But babrpus and babspus are not mentioned anywhere in the given information. So, I have no information about babrpus or babspus. Therefore, it might be unknown for those, but I need to see about babcpus.\n\nSince x is taprpus, and taprpus is focnpus and yiptpus, so x belongs to focnpus and yiptpus.\n\nNow, focnpus is lomzpus, so x belongs to lomzpus through focnpus.\n\nlomzpus is hodbpus and luplpus, so x belongs to hodbpus and luplpus.\n\nhodbpus is zusvpus, so x belongs to zusvpus.\n\nzusvpus is bowtpus, so x belongs to bowtpus.\n\nbowtpus is vowdpus, so x belongs to vowdpus.\n\nvowdpus is husbpus, so x belongs to husbpus.\n\nhusbpus is babcpus and jugwpus, so x belongs to babcpus and jugwpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus.\n\nThe question is: is x babcpus or babrpus or babspus? Since x is babcpus, it is true that x is babcpus. But the question uses \"or\", so if x is babcpus, then the statement \"x is babcpus or babrpus or babspus\" is true because one of the conditions is satisfied.\n\nEven though babrpus and babspus are not mentioned, since x is babcpus, the OR statement is true.\n\nSo, it should be true.\n\nBut let me confirm if there's any trick. The note says 'A is B' means A belongs to B, so it's about membership. From above, x belongs to babcpus, so yes.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that all connections are valid.

The other terms like babrpus and babspus are not defined, so we cannot say x is them, but since x is babcpus, the OR holds.\n\nThus, it is true.",

IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nThus, it is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

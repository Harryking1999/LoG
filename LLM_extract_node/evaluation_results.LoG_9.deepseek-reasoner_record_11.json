  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is both babbpus and babmpus. From the given information, I know that \"x is cukrpus and kumtpus.\" So x belongs to categories cukrpus and kumtpus.

Let me check the original.\n\nFrom the given: \"yedhpus is hecnpus.\" and \"hecnpus is laxjpus.\" and then later \"hecnpus is liqspus.\" – but in the context, hecnpus might have multiple categories. Similarly, \"hecnpus is laxjpus\" and \"hecnpus is liqspus\" are both stated, so hecnpus belongs to both laxjpus and liqspus.\n\nNow, \"laxjpus is xoqlpus.\"\n\n\"xoqlpus is falbpus and monspus.\"\n\n\"falbpus is macvpus.\"\n\n\"macvpus is xihbpus.\"\n\n\"xihbpus is morkpus.\"\n\n\"morkpus is puqnpus and yelbpus and jotmpus.\"\n\n\"puqnpus is bipspus.\" and also \"puqnpus is giczpus and yefppus.\" – again, multiple categories.\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus or babmpus, which seem unrelated so far.\n\nPerhaps I should look for connections through other paths.\n\nx is also kumtpus. But I don't see kumtpus mentioned anywhere else in the given information. Let me scan the entire text for kumtpus.\n\nThe only mention of kumtpus is in \"x is cukrpus and kumtpus.\" So kumtpus might be a category that isn't further defined, or it might be a terminal category. But I need to see if it connects to babbpus or babmpus.\n\nSince kumtpus isn't mentioned again, it might not lead to anything else. So I should focus on cukrpus.\n\nFrom cukrpus, we have rasqpus, which leads to yedhpus, which leads to hecnpus.\n\nhecnpus leads to laxjpus and liqspus.\n\nlaxjpus leads to xoqlpus.\n\nxoqlpus leads to falbpus and monspus.\n\nfalbpus leads to macvpus.\n\nmacvpus leads to xihbpus.\n\nxihbpus leads to morkpus.\n\nmorkpus leads to puqnpus, yelbpus, jotmpus.\n\npuqnpus leads to bipspus and also to giczpus and yefppus.\n\nbipspus leads to fodhpus and kebzpus.\n\nfodhpus leads to bibvpus and bugxpus.\n\nbibvpus leads to qoyqpus.\n\nqoyqpus leads to linnpus.\n\nlinnpus leads to xejwpus.\n\nxejwpus leads to kuggpus and ninmpus.\n\nkuggpus leads to selfpus.\n\nselfpus leads to dokwpus and gopzpus and feydpus.\n\nThis seems to be going away from babbpus and babmpus.\n\nFrom puqnpus, also to giczpus: \"puqnpus is giczpus and yefppus.\" and \"giczpus is gezspus.\" and \"gezspus is wihcpus.\" and \"wihcpus is kinkpus.\" and \"kinkpus is xuwhpus and gupmpus.\" and \"xuwhpus is vojxpus.\" and \"xuwhpus is rujgpus.\" – this is messy.\n\nI need a better approach. I should list all categories that are connected to babbpus and babmpus.\n\nFirst, babbpus: from \"bahmpus is babbpus\" and \"monnpus is bahmpus\" and \"samwpus is monnpus and takxpus\" and \"sobmpus is samwpus and tayrpus\" and \"xecrpus is sobmpus\" but also \"xecrpus is xejdpus and fejspus\" and \"xecrpus is hesxpus\" – multiple for xecrpus.\n\nxecrpus is mentioned multiple times: \"xecrpus is xejdpus and fejspus\" and \"xecrpus is sobmpus\" and also \"mixvpus is xecrpus and rivspus\" and \"qumfpus is mixvpus\" and \"yemtpus is qumfpus\" and \"fovmpus is yemtpus\" and \"helppus is fovmpus and yesmpus\" and \"zodvpus is kuplpus\" and \"heswpus is zodvpus\" and \"joqcpus is heswpus\" and \"vafvpus is joqcpus\" and \"semhpus is vafvpus and veqypus and hihgpus\" and \"pesspus is semhpus and sehjpus\" and \"sahxpus is pesspus and rabcpus and commpus and toxcpus\" and \"pecspus is sahxpus\" and \"sapwpus is pecspus\" and \"mayzpus is sapwpus and ketcpus\" and \"kakqpus is mayzpus\" and \"firvpus is kakqpus and ziwkpus\" and \"pafypus is firvpus\" and \"pihzpus is pafypus and pohxpus and caltpus\" and \"dunxpus is pihzpus\" and \"ruqrpus is dunxpus and sofbpus\" and \"codqpus is ruqrpus\" and \"negzpus is codqpus\" and \"vitmpus is negzpus\" and \"bogqpus is vitmpus and lutmpus\" and \"najxpus is bogqpus and cewppus\" and \"holwpus is najxpus\" and \"gefhpus is holwpus and domfpus\" and \"dinmpus is gefhpus and biztpus\" and \"zefrpus is dinmpus and xalppus\" and \"cisbpus is zefrpus\" and \"tejmpus is cisbpus\" and \"bupzpus is tejmpus and vigypus\" and \"batdpus is bupzpus and kilkpus\" and \"zimhpus is batdpus\" and \"weqlpus is zimhpus and mujxpus\" and \"xamzpus is weqlpus\" and \"wepfpus is xamzpus\" and \"ritkpus is wepfpus\" and \"joplpus is ritkpus\" and \"kehjpus is joplpus\" and \"hizjpus is kehjpus\" and \"dikvpus is hizjpus\" and \"lepfpus is dikvpus and sufppus\" and \"xakmpus is lepfpus\" and \"pexrpus is xakmpus and duzxpus\" and \"qorxpus is pexrpus and wuscpus\" and \"rebxpus is qorxpus\" and \"vojxpus is rebxpus\" and \"xuwhpus is vojxpus\" and \"kinkpus is xuwhpus and gupmpus\" and \"wihcpus is kinkpus\" and \"gezspus is wihcpus\" and \"giczpus is gezspus\" and \"puqnpus is giczpus and yefppus\" – back to puqnpus.\n\nThis is very complex. I am considering that x might not be connected to babbpus or babmpus through cukrpus.\n\nBut let's think about babmpus.\n\nbabmpus is from faycpus: \"faycpus is babmpus and yepypus\" and \"bimzpus is faycpus\" and \"xejdpus is bimzpus and vozcpus\" and \"xecrpus is xejdpus and fejspus\" so xecrpus includes xejdpus, which includes bimzpus, which includes faycpus, which includes babmpus.\n\nSo xecrpus has babmpus in its chain.\n\nBut is x connected to xecrpus? x is cukrpus, and from cukrpus, we have rasqpus -> yedhpus -> hecnpus -> laxjpus -> xoqlpus -> falbpus -> macvpus -> xihbpus -> morkpus -> puqnpus -> ... and eventually to xecrpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom morkpus, it is puqnpus, and puqnpus is giczpus, and giczpus is gezspus, and gezspus is wihcpus, and wihcpus is kinkpus, and kinkpus is xuwhpus and gupmpus, and xuwhpus is vojxpus, and vojxpus is rebxpus, and rebxpus is qorxpus, and qorxpus is pexrpus and wuscpus, and pexrpus is xakmpus and duzxpus, and xakmpus is lepfpus, and lepfpus is dikvpus and sufppus, and dikvpus is hizjpus, and hizjpus is kehjpus, and kehjpus is joplpus, and joplpus is ritkpus, and ritkpus is wepfpus, and wepfpus is xamzpus, and xamzpus is weqlpus, and weqlpus is zimhpus and mujxpus, and zimhpus is batdpus, and batdpus is bupzpus and kilkpus, and bupzpus is tejmpus and vigypus, and tejmpus is cisbpus, and cisbpus is zefrpus, and zefrpus is dinmpus and xalppus, and dinmpus is gefhpus and biztpus, and gefhpus is holwpus and domfpus, and holwpus is najxpus, and najxpus is bogqpus and cewppus, and bogqpus is vitmpus and lutmpus, and vitmpus is negzpus, and negzpus is codqpus, and codqpus is ruqrpus, and ruqrpus is dunxpus and sofbpus, and dunxpus is pihzpus, and pihzpus is pafypus and pohxpus and caltpus, and pafypus is firvpus, and firvpus is kakqpus and ziwkpus, and kakqpus is mayzpus, and mayzpus is sapwpus and ketcpus, and sapwpus is pecspus, and pecspus is sahxpus, and sahxpus is pesspus and rabcpus and commpus and toxcpus, and pesspus is semhpus and sehjpus, and semhpus is vafvpus and veqypus and hihgpus, and vafvpus is joqcpus, and joqcpus is heswpus, and heswpus is zodvpus, and zodvpus is kuplpus, and kuplpus is helppus, and helppus is fovmpus and yesmpus, and fovmpus is yemtpus, and yemtpus is qumfpus, and qumfpus is mixvpus, and mixvpus is xecrpus and rivspus.\n\nSo finally, from puqnpus, through a long chain, we reach mixvpus which is xecrpus and rivspus. So xecrpus is reached from puqnpus.\n\nBut from x, through cukrpus, rasqpus, yedhpus, hecnpus, laxjpus, xoqlpus, falbpus, macvpus, xihbpus, morkpus, we reach puqnpus. So yes, x is connected to puqnpus, and thus to xecrpus.\n\nSince xecrpus includes xejdpus, which includes bimzpus, which includes faycpus, which includes babmpus, therefore x belongs to babmpus.\n\nBut we need to see if x is babmpus directly? In this chain, x is connected to xecrpus, which has xejdpus, which has bimzpus, which has faycpus, which has babmpus. So since x is in the chain that leads to babmpus, does that mean x is babmpus?\n\nIn this context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if B is C, then A is C, because categories are hierarchical. So if x is cukrpus, and cukrpus is rasqpus, then x is rasqpus, and so on. So through the chain, x should be babmpus.\n\nBut let's confirm the chain step by step.\n\nx is cukrpus.\n\ncukrpus is rasqpus, so x is rasqpus.\n\nrasqpus is yedhpus, so x is yedhpus.\n\nyedhpus is hecnpus, so x is hecnpus.\n\nhecnpus is laxjpus, so x is laxjpus.\n\nlaxjpus is xoqlpus, so x is xoqlpus.\n\nxoqlpus is falbpus, so x is falbpus.\n\nfalbpus is macvpus, so x is macvpus.\n\nmacvpus is xihbpus, so x is xihbpus.\n\nxihbpus is morkpus, so x is morkpus.\n\nmorkpus is puqnpus, so x is puqnpus.\n\npuqnpus is giczpus, so x is giczpus. (since puqnpus is giczpus and yefppus, so x is giczpus)\n\ngiczpus is gezspus, so x is gezspus.\n\ngezspus is wihcpus, so x is wihcpus.\n\nwihcpus is kinkpus, so x is kinkpus.\n\nkinkpus is xuwhpus, so x is xuwhpus.

So I should focus on cukrpus.\n\nFrom cukrpus, we have rasqpus, which leads to yedhpus, which leads to hecnpus.\n\nhecnpus leads to laxjpus and liqspus.\n\nlaxjpus leads to xoqlpus.\n\nxoqlpus leads to falbpus and monspus.\n\nfalbpus leads to macvpus.\n\nmacvpus leads to xihbpus.\n\nxihbpus leads to morkpus.\n\nmorkpus leads to puqnpus, yelbpus, jotmpus.\n\npuqnpus leads to bipspus and also to giczpus and yefppus.\n\nbipspus leads to fodhpus and kebzpus.\n\nfodhpus leads to bibvpus and bugxpus.\n\nbibvpus leads to qoyqpus.\n\nqoyqpus leads to linnpus.\n\nlinnpus leads to xejwpus.\n\nxejwpus leads to kuggpus and ninmpus.\n\nkuggpus leads to selfpus.\n\nselfpus leads to dokwpus and gopzpus and feydpus.\n\nThis seems to be going away from babbpus and babmpus.\n\nFrom puqnpus, also to giczpus: \"puqnpus is giczpus and yefppus.\" and \"giczpus is gezspus.\" and \"gezspus is wihcpus.\" and \"wihcpus is kinkpus.\" and \"kinkpus is xuwhpus and gupmpus.\" and \"xuwhpus is vojxpus.\" and \"xuwhpus is rujgpus.\" – this is messy.\n\nI need a better approach. I should list all categories that are connected to babbpus and babmpus.\n\nFirst, babbpus: from \"bahmpus is babbpus\" and \"monnpus is bahmpus\" and \"samwpus is monnpus and takxpus\" and \"sobmpus is samwpus and tayrpus\" and \"xecrpus is sobmpus\" but also \"xecrpus is xejdpus and fejspus\" and \"xecrpus is hesxpus\" – multiple for xecrpus.\n\nxecrpus is mentioned multiple times: \"xecrpus is xejdpus and fejspus\" and \"xecrpus is sobmpus\" and also \"mixvpus is xecrpus and rivspus\" and \"qumfpus is mixvpus\" and \"yemtpus is qumfpus\" and \"fovmpus is yemtpus\" and \"helppus is fovmpus and yesmpus\" and \"zodvpus is kuplpus\" and \"heswpus is zodvpus\" and \"joqcpus is heswpus\" and \"vafvpus is joqcpus\" and \"semhpus is vafvpus and veqypus and hihgpus\" and \"pesspus is semhpus and sehjpus\" and \"sahxpus is pesspus and rabcpus and commpus and toxcpus\" and \"pecspus is sahxpus\" and \"sapwpus is pecspus\" and \"mayzpus is sapwpus and ketcpus\" and \"kakqpus is mayzpus\" and \"firvpus is kakqpus and ziwkpus\" and \"pafypus is firvpus\" and \"pihzpus is pafypus and pohxpus and caltpus\" and \"dunxpus is pihzpus\" and \"ruqrpus is dunxpus and sofbpus\" and \"codqpus is ruqrpus\" and \"negzpus is codqpus\" and \"vitmpus is negzpus\" and \"bogqpus is vitmpus and lutmpus\" and \"najxpus is bogqpus and cewppus\" and \"holwpus is najxpus\" and \"gefhpus is holwpus and domfpus\" and \"dinmpus is gefhpus and biztpus\" and \"zefrpus is dinmpus and xalppus\" and \"cisbpus is zefrpus\" and \"tejmpus is cisbpus\" and \"bupzpus is tejmpus and vigypus\" and \"batdpus is bupzpus and kilkpus\" and \"zimhpus is batdpus\" and \"weqlpus is zimhpus and mujxpus\" and \"xamzpus is weqlpus\" and \"wepfpus is xamzpus\" and \"ritkpus is wepfpus\" and \"joplpus is ritkpus\" and \"kehjpus is joplpus\" and \"hizjpus is kehjpus\" and \"dikvpus is hizjpus\" and \"lepfpus is dikvpus and sufppus\" and \"xakmpus is lepfpus\" and \"pexrpus is xakmpus and duzxpus\" and \"qorxpus is pexrpus and wuscpus\" and \"rebxpus is qorxpus\" and \"vojxpus is rebxpus\" and \"xuwhpus is vojxpus\" and \"kinkpus is xuwhpus and gupmpus\" and \"wihcpus is kinkpus\" and \"gezspus is wihcpus\" and \"giczpus is gezspus\" and \"puqnpus is giczpus and yefppus\" – back to puqnpus.\n\nThis is very complex. I am considering that x might not be connected to babbpus or babmpus through cukrpus.\n\nBut let's think about babmpus.\n\nbabmpus is from faycpus: \"faycpus is babmpus and yepypus\" and \"bimzpus is faycpus\" and \"xejdpus is bimzpus and vozcpus\" and \"xecrpus is xejdpus and fejspus\" so xecrpus includes xejdpus, which includes bimzpus, which includes faycpus, which includes babmpus.\n\nSo xecrpus has babmpus in its chain.\n\nBut is x connected to xecrpus? x is cukrpus, and from cukrpus, we have rasqpus -> yedhpus -> hecnpus -> laxjpus -> xoqlpus -> falbpus -> macvpus -> xihbpus -> morkpus -> puqnpus -> ... and eventually to xecrpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom morkpus, it is puqnpus, and puqnpus is giczpus, and giczpus is gezspus, and gezspus is wihcpus, and wihcpus is kinkpus, and kinkpus is xuwhpus and gupmpus, and xuwhpus is vojxpus, and vojxpus is rebxpus, and rebxpus is qorxpus, and qorxpus is pexrpus and wuscpus, and pexrpus is xakmpus and duzxpus, and xakmpus is lepfpus, and lepfpus is dikvpus and sufppus, and dikvpus is hizjpus, and hizjpus is kehjpus, and kehjpus is joplpus, and joplpus is ritkpus, and ritkpus is wepfpus, and wepfpus is xamzpus, and xamzpus is weqlpus, and weqlpus is zimhpus and mujxpus, and zimhpus is batdpus, and batdpus is bupzpus and kilkpus, and bupzpus is tejmpus and vigypus, and tejmpus is cisbpus, and cisbpus is zefrpus, and zefrpus is dinmpus and xalppus, and dinmpus is gefhpus and biztpus, and gefhpus is holwpus and domfpus, and holwpus is najxpus, and najxpus is bogqpus and cewppus, and bogqpus is vitmpus and lutmpus, and vitmpus is negzpus, and negzpus is codqpus, and codqpus is ruqrpus, and ruqrpus is dunxpus and sofbpus, and dunxpus is pihzpus, and pihzpus is pafypus and pohxpus and caltpus, and pafypus is firvpus, and firvpus is kakqpus and ziwkpus, and kakqpus is mayzpus, and mayzpus is sapwpus and ketcpus, and sapwpus is pecspus, and pecspus is sahxpus, and sahxpus is pesspus and rabcpus and commpus and toxcpus, and pesspus is semhpus and sehjpus, and semhpus is vafvpus and veqypus and hihgpus, and vafvpus is joqcpus, and joqcpus is heswpus, and heswpus is zodvpus, and zodvpus is kuplpus, and kuplpus is helppus, and helppus is fovmpus and yesmpus, and fovmpus is yemtpus, and yemtpus is qumfpus, and qumfpus is mixvpus, and mixvpus is xecrpus and rivspus.\n\nSo finally, from puqnpus, through a long chain, we reach mixvpus which is xecrpus and rivspus. So xecrpus is reached from puqnpus.\n\nBut from x, through cukrpus, rasqpus, yedhpus, hecnpus, laxjpus, xoqlpus, falbpus, macvpus, xihbpus, morkpus, we reach puqnpus. So yes, x is connected to puqnpus, and thus to xecrpus.\n\nSince xecrpus includes xejdpus, which includes bimzpus, which includes faycpus, which includes babmpus, therefore x belongs to babmpus.\n\nBut we need to see if x is babmpus directly? In this chain, x is connected to xecrpus, which has xejdpus, which has bimzpus, which has faycpus, which has babmpus. So since x is in the chain that leads to babmpus, does that mean x is babmpus?\n\nIn this context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if B is C, then A is C, because categories are hierarchical. So if x is cukrpus, and cukrpus is rasqpus, then x is rasqpus, and so on. So through the chain, x should be babmpus.\n\nBut let's confirm the chain step by step.\n\nx is cukrpus.\n\ncukrpus is rasqpus, so x is rasqpus.\n\nrasqpus is yedhpus, so x is yedhpus.\n\nyedhpus is hecnpus, so x is hecnpus.\n\nhecnpus is laxjpus, so x is laxjpus.\n\nlaxjpus is xoqlpus, so x is xoqlpus.\n\nxoqlpus is falbpus, so x is falbpus.\n\nfalbpus is macvpus, so x is macvpus.\n\nmacvpus is xihbpus, so x is xihbpus.\n\nxihbpus is morkpus, so x is morkpus.\n\nmorkpus is puqnpus, so x is puqnpus.\n\npuqnpus is giczpus, so x is giczpus.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the relationships. The statement \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, it's about set membership or hierarchy.\n\nI have several statements:\n\n1. wacdpus is babgpus.\n\n2. lejspus is lizwpus and yomlpus.\n\n3. bolbpus is kidcpus.\n\n4. wacdpus is bolbpus.\n\n5. wacdpus is bilfpus.\n\n6. x is mergpus.\n\n7. lejspus is yusmpus and caglpus.\n\n8. yusmpus is tuqwpus.\n\n9. tuqwpus is wacdpus and fumwpus.\n\n10. mergpus is lejspus and jucbpus.\n\nI need to find out if x is babgpus.\n\nSince x is mergpus (from point 6), and I need to see if x is babgpus, I should trace the connections from mergpus to babgpus.\n\nFrom point 10: mergpus is lejspus and jucbpus. This means that mergpus contains lejspus and jucbpus, or lejspus belongs to mergpus? The notation is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the note: \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B. So, if A is B, then A is a member of B or a subset of B.\n\nIn point 10, \"mergpus is lejspus and jucbpus\" – this probably means that mergpus consists of lejspus and jucbpus, or that lejspus and jucbpus are parts of mergpus. But from the membership perspective, if A is B, it means A is in B. So, for example, if mergpus is lejspus, that would mean mergpus is contained in lejspus? That seems backwards.\n\nI need to clarify the direction. The note says: \"'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'\". So, if A is B, then A is a member of B, or A is a subset of B. But in common usage, \"is\" might imply identity, but here it's specified that it means belonging or containment.\n\nLet's look at examples from the given information. For instance, \"wacdpus is babgpus\" means wacdpus belongs to babgpus. Similarly, \"wacdpus is bolbpus\" means wacdpus belongs to bolbpus.\n\nBut in point 10, \"mergpus is lejspus and jucbpus\" – this seems to mean that mergpus belongs to lejspus and jucbpus? That would be strange because mergpus can't belong to two things simultaneously. Alternatively, it might mean that mergpus is composed of lejspus and jucbpus, meaning that lejspus and jucbpus are categories that contain mergpus? But the note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so B is the category.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in the parsing. Let me read point 10 carefully: \"mergpus is lejspus and jucbpus\". According to the note, this should mean that mergpus belongs to lejspus and also mergpus belongs to jucbpus. But that would imply that mergpus is in both lejspus and jucbpus, which might be possible if lejspus and jucbpus are overlapping categories.\n\nSimilarly, in point 2: \"lejspus is lizwpus and yomlpus\" means lejspus belongs to lizwpus and also to yomlpus.\n\nIn point 7: \"lejspus is yusmpus and caglpus\" means lejspus belongs to yusmpus and to caglpus.\n\nBut from point 8, yusmpus is tuqwpus, so yusmpus belongs to tuqwpus.\n\nAnd from point 9, tuqwpus is wacdpus and fumwpus, so tuqwpus belongs to wacdpus and to fumwpus.\n\nAlso, from point 4, wacdpus is bolbpus, so wacdpus belongs to bolbpus.\n\nFrom point 3, bolbpus is kidcpus, so bolbpus belongs to kidcpus.\n\nFrom point 1, wacdpus is babgpus, so wacdpus belongs to babgpus.\n\nFrom point 5, wacdpus is bilfpus, so wacdpus belongs to bilfpus.\n\nNow, x is mergpus, so x belongs to mergpus.\n\nBut we need to know if x is babgpus, meaning does x belong to babgpus?\n\nSince x belongs to mergpus, if mergpus belongs to babgpus, then x might belong to babgpus, but we need to see the chain.\n\nThe relationship is not necessarily transitive in terms of membership? But in category membership, if A belongs to B and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C? Not always, because B might be a category, and A is in B, B is in C, so A is in C? That depends on how we interpret \"belongs to\".\n\nIn set theory, if A is an element of B and B is an element of C, then A is not necessarily an element of C. But if \"belongs to\" means subset, then if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C.\n\nBut here, from the statements, we have both types? Let's see.\n\nFor example, wacdpus is babgpus: wacdpus is an element of babgpus set? Or wacdpus is a subset of babgpus? The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B, so it could be either.\n\nBut in the context, since we have things like \"lejspus is lizwpus and yomlpus\", it seems that lejspus is a member of multiple categories, so probably \"is\" means element membership, not subset.\n\nSimilarly, \"mergpus is lejspus and jucbpus\" means mergpus is a member of lejspus and also a member of jucbpus.\n\nSo, for x, x is mergpus, so x is an element of mergpus.\n\nBut we need to know if x is an element of babgpus.\n\nSo, to find if x is in babgpus, we need to see if mergpus is in babgpus or if there is a chain from mergpus to babgpus.\n\nBut since membership is not transitive, we need to find if babgpus contains mergpus or something.\n\nLet's list all the membership relations from the given.\n\nLet me denote the relations as \"A ∈ B\" meaning A is a member of B.\n\nFrom the given:\n\n1. wacdpus ∈ babgpus\n\n2. lejspus ∈ lizwpus and lejspus ∈ yomlpus  (from \"lejspus is lizwpus and yomlpus\")\n\n3. bolbpus ∈ kidcpus\n\n4. wacdpus ∈ bolbpus\n\n5. wacdpus ∈ bilfpus\n\n6. x ∈ mergpus\n\n7. lejspus ∈ yusmpus and lejspus ∈ caglpus  (from \"lejspus is yusmpus and caglpus\")\n\n8. yusmpus ∈ tuqwpus\n\n9. tuqwpus ∈ wacdpus and tuqwpus ∈ fumwpus  (from \"tuqwpus is wacdpus and fumwpus\")\n\n10. mergpus ∈ lejspus and mergpus ∈ jucbpus  (from \"mergpus is lejspus and jucbpus\")\n\nNow, we need to find if x ∈ babgpus.\n\nSince x ∈ mergpus and mergpus ∈ lejspus, then x ∈ lejspus? Is membership transitive? If x is in mergpus and mergpus is in lejspus, does that mean x is in lejspus? Only if lejspus is a set that contains mergpus as an element, but x is an element of mergpus, so x may not be an element of lejspus unless mergpus is a subset of lejspus, but from the relation, mergpus ∈ lejspus, which means mergpus is an element of lejspus, so lejspus is a set that contains mergpus as an element, but x is in mergpus, so x is at a lower level, so x is not necessarily in lejspus.\n\nFor example, if mergpus is a box, and lejspus is a room, then mergpus is in the room, but x is in the box, so x is in the box, which is in the room, so x is in the room? But in terms of set membership, if x ∈ mergpus and mergpus ∈ lejspus, it does not imply x ∈ lejspus, because lejspus contains mergpus as an element, but mergpus is a set, and x is an element of that set, so x is not directly an element of lejspus.\n\nIn set theory, if A ∈ B and B ∈ C, then A may not be in C. For example, let B = {A}, and C = {B}, then A ∈ B and B ∈ C, but A ∉ C.\n\nSo, in this case, we cannot assume transitivity for membership.\n\nTherefore, to have x ∈ babgpus, we need a direct statement or a chain where x is directly connected to babgpus, or we need that mergpus is in babgpus, but since x is in mergpus, that doesn't imply x in babgpus.\n\nBut from the statements, we have that wacdpus is in babgpus, but we need x in babgpus.\n\nSo, we need to see if x is related to wacdpus or something.\n\nLet's see what we know about mergpus.\n\nFrom 10, mergpus ∈ lejspus and mergpus ∈ jucbpus.\n\nFrom 7, lejspus ∈ yusmpus and lejspus ∈ caglpus.\n\nFrom 8, yusmpus ∈ tuqwpus.\n\nFrom 9, tuqwpus ∈ wacdpus and tuqwpus ∈ fumwpus.\n\nFrom 4, wacdpus ∈ bolbpus.\n\nFrom 1, wacdpus ∈ babgpus.\n\nBut all these are about mergpus being in lejspus, lejspus in yusmpus, etc., but since membership is not transitive, we cannot say that mergpus is in wacdpus or babgpus.\n\nFor example, from mergpus ∈ lejspus and lejspus ∈ yusmpus, we cannot say mergpus ∈ yusmpus.\n\nSimilarly, from yusmpus ∈ tuqwpus and tuqwpus ∈ wacdpus, we cannot say yusmpus ∈ wacdpus.\n\nSo, directly, there is no chain that shows that mergpus is in babgpus.\n\nBut we also have x ∈ mergpus, so even if mergpus were in babgpus, x might not be in babgpus, as discussed.\n\nSo, for x to be in babgpus, we need that x is directly stated to be in babgpus, or that x is in something that is in babgpus, but since membership isn't transitive, we need that something that contains x is in babgpus, but that doesn't help because x is in mergpus, so if mergpus is in babgpus, then x is in mergpus, which is in babgpus, but since babgpus contains mergpus as an element, and x is in mergpus, x is not necessarily in babgpus.\n\nTo have x in babgpus, we need that babgpus contains x directly or that mergpus is a subset of babgpus, but from the statements, we have only membership, not subset relations.\n\nThe note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B, so it could mean A is a subset of B. But in the given statements, it seems that \"A is B\" is used for membership, not subset.\n\nFor example, \"wacdpus is babgpus\" likely means wacdpus is a member of babgpus category, not that wacdpus is a subset of babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"lejspus is lizwpus\" means lejspus is a member of lizwpus.\n\nSo, in all cases, \"A is B\" means A ∈ B, where B is a category.\n\nTherefore, for x to be in babgpus, we need x ∈ babgpus directly or through a chain of membership, but since membership is not transitive, we cannot use chains.\n\nSo, how can we determine if x is in babgpus?\n\nWe need to find if there is any statement that links x to babgpus.\n\nFrom the given, x is only mentioned in point 6: x is mergpus, so x ∈ mergpus.\n\nmergpus is mentioned in point 10: mergpus is lejspus and jucbpus, so mergpus ∈ lejspus and mergpus ∈ jucbpus.\n\nlejspus is mentioned in points 2 and 7.\n\nBut babgpus is only mentioned in point 1 with wacdpus.\n\nwacdpus is mentioned in points 1,4,5,9.\n\nFrom point 9, tuqwpus is wacdpus and fumwpus, so tuqwpus ∈ wacdpus and tuqwpus ∈ fumwpus.\n\nBut wacdpus is a category, so tuqwpus is a member of wacdpus.\n\nSimilarly, from point 8, yusmpus is tuqwpus, so yusmpus ∈ tuqwpus.\n\nFrom point 7, lejspus is yusmpus and caglpus, so lejspus ∈ yusmpus and lejspus ∈ caglpus.\n\nFrom point 10, mergpus is lejspus, so mergpus ∈ lejspus.\n\nBut again, this doesn't connect to babgpus.\n\nWe have wacdpus ∈ babgpus from point 1.\n\nBut wacdpus is a category, and tuqwpus is in wacdpus, so tuqwpus is in wacdpus, and wacdpus is in babgpus, but since wacdpus is in babgpus, and tuqwpus is in wacdpus, does that mean tuqwpus is in babgpus? No, because wacdpus is a member of babgpus, so babgpus contains wacdpus as an element, but tuqwpus is an element of wacdpus, so tuqwpus is not necessarily an element of babgpus.\n\nFor example, babgpus is a club, wacdpus is a member of the club, and tuqwpus is a friend of wacdpus, but tuqwpus is not a member of the club unless the club allows friends, but in set terms, no.\n\nSo, similarly, there is no way to conclude that x is in babgpus.\n\nBut let's see if there is any other path.\n\nFrom point 4, wacdpus is bolbpus, so wacdpus ∈ bolbpus.\n\nFrom point 3, bolbpus is kidcpus, so bolbpus ∈ kidcpus.\n\nBut again, not related to x.\n\nSo, based on the given information, there is no statement that links x to babgpus. Therefore, we cannot conclude that x is babgpus.\n\nThe question is to say true, false, or unknown. Since we cannot conclude it, it should be unknown.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any indirect chain.\n\nNotice that from point 9, tuqwpus is wacdpus and fumwpus, so tuqwpus ∈ wacdpus.\n\nBut wacdpus is a category, and from point 1, wacdpus ∈ babgpus, so babgpus contains wacdpus as a member, but tuqwpus is a member of wacdpus, so for tuqwpus to be in babgpus, babgpus would need to contain all members of wacdpus, but that is not stated. So, no.\n\nSimilarly, from point 8, yusmpus ∈ tuqwpus, and from point 7, lejspus ∈ yusmpus, from point 10, mergpus ∈ lejspus, from point 6, x ∈ mergpus.\n\nSo, x is in mergpus, which is in lejspus, which is in yusmpus, which is in tuqwpus, which is in wacdpus.\n\nBut wacdpus is in babgpus.\n\nSo, if we had that wacdpus is a set that contains tuqwpus, and since wacdpus is in babgpus, but babgpus may not contain elements of wacdpus unless babgpus is a set of sets, but even then, x is an element of an element of an element of wacdpus, so x is not in wacdpus directly; x is in mergpus, which is in lejspus, etc., and eventually tuqwpus is in wacdpus, but tuqwpus contains yusmpus, which contains lejspus, which contains mergpus, which contains x, so x is deep inside, but wacdpus only contains tuqwpus as an element, so x is not an element of wacdpus.\n\nTherefore, x is not necessarily in babgpus.\n\nThus, we cannot say that x is babgpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be unknown.\n\nBut let's see the question: \"Is it true or false or unknown: x is babgpus?\"\n\nBased on reasoning, it is unknown.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thought: from point 10, mergpus is lejspus, and from point 7, lejspus is yusmpus, but again, not helpful.\n\nFrom point 9, tuqwpus is wacdpus, meaning tuqwpus ∈ wacdpus, and from point 1, wacdpus ∈ babgpus, so if we assume that babgpus is a category that includes all members of its members, but that is not stated. So, we cannot assume that.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, we cannot conclude that x is babgpus.\n\nSo, the answer is unknown.",

But in the given statements, it seems that \"A is B\" is used for membership, not subset.\n\nFor example, \"wacdpus is babgpus\" likely means wacdpus is a member of babgpus category, not that wacdpus is a subset of babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"lejspus is lizwpus\" means lejspus is a member of lizwpus.\n\nSo, in all cases, \"A is B\" means A ∈ B, where B is a category.\n\nTherefore, for x to be in babgpus, we need x ∈ babgpus directly or through a chain of membership, but since membership is not transitive, we cannot use chains.\n\nSo, how can we determine if x is in babgpus?\n\nWe need to find if there is any statement that links x to babgpus.\n\nFrom the given, x is only mentioned in point 6: x is mergpus, so x ∈ mergpus.\n\nmergpus is mentioned in point 10: mergpus is lejspus and jucbpus, so mergpus ∈ lejspus and mergpus ∈ jucbpus.\n\nlejspus is mentioned in points 2 and 7.\n\nBut babgpus is only mentioned in point 1 with wacdpus.\n\nwacdpus is mentioned in points 1,4,5,9.\n\nFrom point 9, tuqwpus is wacdpus and fumwpus, so tuqwpus ∈ wacdpus and tuqwpus ∈ fumwpus.\n\nBut wacdpus is a category, so tuqwpus is a member of wacdpus.\n\nSimilarly, from point 8, yusmpus is tuqwpus, so yusmpus ∈ tuqwpus.\n\nFrom point 7, lejspus is yusmpus and caglpus, so lejspus ∈ yusmpus and lejspus ∈ caglpus.\n\nFrom point 10, mergpus is lejspus, so mergpus ∈ lejspus.\n\nBut again, this doesn't connect to babgpus.\n\nWe have wacdpus ∈ babgpus from point 1.\n\nBut wacdpus is a category, and tuqwpus is in wacdpus, so tuqwpus is in wacdpus, and wacdpus is in babgpus, but since wacdpus is in babgpus, and tuqwpus is in wacdpus, does that mean tuqwpus is in babgpus? No, because wacdpus is a member of babgpus, so babgpus contains wacdpus as an element, but tuqwpus is an element of wacdpus, so tuqwpus is not necessarily an element of babgpus.\n\nFor example, babgpus is a club, wacdpus is a member of the club, and tuqwpus is a friend of wacdpus, but tuqwpus is not a member of the club unless the club allows friends, but in set terms, no.\n\nSo, similarly, there is no way to conclude that x is in babgpus.\n\nBut let's see if there is any other path.\n\nFrom point 4, wacdpus is bolbpus, so wacdpus ∈ bolbpus.\n\nFrom point 3, bolbpus is kidcpus, so bolbpus ∈ kidcpus.\n\nBut again, not related to x.\n\nSo, based on the given information, there is no statement that links x to babgpus. Therefore, we cannot conclude that x is babgpus.\n\nThe question is to say true, false, or unknown. Since we cannot conclude it, it should be unknown.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any indirect chain.\n\nNotice that from point 9, tuqwpus is wacdpus and fumwpus, so tuqwpus ∈ wacdpus.\n\nBut wacdpus is a category, and from point 1, wacdpus ∈ babgpus, so babgpus contains wacdpus as a member, but tuqwpus is a member of wacdpus, so for tuqwpus to be in babgpus, babgpus would need to contain all members of wacdpus, but that is not stated. So, no.\n\nSimilarly, from point 8, yusmpus ∈ tuqwpus, and from point 7, lejspus ∈ yusmpus, from point 10, mergpus ∈ lejspus, from point 6, x ∈ mergpus.\n\nSo, x is in mergpus, which is in lejspus, which is in yusmpus, which is in tuqwpus, which is in wacdpus.\n\nBut wacdpus is in babgpus.\n\nSo, if we had that wacdpus is a set that contains tuqwpus, and since wacdpus is in babgpus, but babgpus may not contain elements of wacdpus unless babgpus is a set of sets, but even then, x is an element of an element of an element of wacdpus, so x is not in wacdpus directly; x is in mergpus, which is in lejspus, etc., and eventually tuqwpus is in wacdpus, but tuqwpus contains yusmpus, which contains lejspus, which contains mergpus, which contains x, so x is deep inside, but wacdpus only contains tuqwpus as an element, so x is not an element of wacdpus.\n\nTherefore, x is not necessarily in babgpus.\n\nThus, we cannot say that x is babgpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be unknown.\n\nBut let's see the question: \"Is it true or false or unknown: x is babgpus?\"\n\nBased on reasoning, it is unknown.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thought: from point 10, mergpus is lejspus, and from point 7, lejspus is yusmpus, but again, not helpful.\n\nFrom point 9, tuqwpus is wacdpus, meaning tuqwpus ∈ wacdpus, and from point 1, wacdpus ∈ babgpus, so if we assume that babgpus is a category that includes all members of its members, but that is not stated. So, we cannot assume that.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, we cannot conclude that x is babgpus.\n\nSo, the answer is unknown.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, the answer is unknown.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

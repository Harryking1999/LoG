  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the given information. It says: \"pestpus is babxpus and fomdpus and hecjpus.\" This means pestpus belongs to the categories babxpus, fomdpus, and hecjpus.\n\nThen, it says: \"x is pestpus and fucdpus.\" So x belongs to pestpus and fucdpus.\n\nThe question is: Is it true or false or unknown that x is babdpus or babqpus or babxpus?\n\nI need to see if x belongs to any of these categories: babdpus, babqpus, or babxpus.\n\nFrom the information, x is pestpus, and pestpus is babxpus. So if x is pestpus, and pestpus is babxpus, then x should be babxpus. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let's confirm the categories. The question is asking about \"babdpus or babqpus or babxpus\". Since x is babxpus through pestpus, it should be true that x is babxpus.\n\nThe \"or\" means that if x is any one of these, the statement is true. So even if x is not babdpus or babqpus, as long as it is babxpus, the statement holds.\n\nSo, from the given: x is pestpus, and pestpus is babxpus, so x is babxpus. Therefore, x is babxpus, which is one of the options, so the statement \"x is babdpus or babqpus or babxpus\" is true.\n\nI should check if there's any other information that might contradict this. The only other thing is that x is also fucdpus, but that doesn't affect the categories we're looking at.\n\nAlso, the note says that 'A is B' means A belongs to category B, so it's about set membership, not equality. So x is a member of pestpus, and pestpus is a member of babxpus, meaning pestpus is a subset of babxpus? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So it could mean that A is an instance of B, or that A is a subset of B. In logic, this might be ambiguous, but from the context, I think \"A is B\" means A is a member of the set B.\n\nSimilarly, \"pestpus is babxpus\" means pestpus is a member of babxpus.\n\nThen \"x is pestpus\" means x is a member of pestpus.\n\nSo, if pestpus is a member of babxpus, and x is a member of pestpus, then x is also a member of babxpus? Not necessarily. If we think in terms of sets, if A is a member of B, and B is a member of C, it doesn't mean A is a member of C, unless we have a chain of membership or something else.\n\nThis is important. In set theory, if x ∈ A and A ∈ B, it does not imply that x ∈ B. For example, if A is a set that is an element of B, and x is an element of A, x may not be an element of B unless B is a set of sets or something.\n\nBut in this context, the categories might be hierarchical, but the note doesn't specify that. The note says \"A belongs to category B\" which might imply that categories are sets, and A is an element of that set.\n\nBut if pestpus is a category itself, and x is in pestpus, and pestpus is in babxpus, that doesn't mean x is in babxpus.\n\nFor example, think of babxpus as a category of categories, and pestpus is one of those categories, and x is an item in pestpus. Then x is not necessarily in babxpus; babxpus contains categories, not items directly.\n\nThe question is asking if x is in babdpus or babqpus or babxpus, which are probably categories similar to babxpus.\n\nSo, from the information, we know that pestpus is in babxpus, meaning pestpus is a member of the babxpus category.\n\nx is in pestpus, meaning x is a member of the pestpus category.\n\nBut we don't know if babxpus contains items directly or only categories. If babxpus is a category of items, then since pestpus is in babxpus, and pestpus contains x, it might imply that x is in babxpus, but that depends on how the categories are defined.\n\nIn standard set theory, membership is not transitive unless specified.\n\nHowever, in many knowledge representation systems, \"is-a\" relationships can be transitive if we are dealing with subclasses or instances.\n\nBut here, the note says \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". The word \"contained\" might imply subset, but it says \"or\", so it could be either.\n\nLet's read the note again: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\"\n\nSo, it might mean that \"A is B\" can mean either A is an instance of B or A is a subset of B. But that would be ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps in this context, \"A is B\" means that A is a subtype of B or a member of B.\n\nBut for the reasoning, we need to be careful.\n\nLooking at the given: \"pestpus is babxpus and fomdpus and hecjpus\" – this likely means that pestpus is a member of multiple categories.\n\nSimilarly, \"x is pestpus and fucdpus\" – x is a member of pestpus and fucdpus.\n\nNow, for x to be a member of babxpus, we need to know if membership is transitive.\n\nBut from the information, we don't have any statement that categories are transitive or that belonging implies inheritance.\n\nTherefore, since we only know that pestpus is in babxpus, and x is in pestpus, we cannot conclude that x is in babxpus, because babxpus might be a category of categories, not of x.\n\nFor example, if babxpus is \"animals\", pestpus is \"dogs\", and x is \"Fido\", then dogs are animals, and Fido is a dog, so Fido is an animal. But in that case, \"is\" means \"is a type of\", which is transitive.\n\nBut in this context, the note says \"A belongs to category B\", which for \"dogs are animals\" would mean dogs belong to the category animals, which is true, and then \"Fido is a dog\" means Fido belongs to the category dogs, so Fido belongs to animals.\n\nSo if \"is\" means \"is a member of the category\", and categories can contain both individuals and other categories, then if a category C contains category D, and D contains individual x, then x is in C only if C is a category that includes all members of its subcategories, which is usually the case in taxonomy.\n\nBut in strict set theory, if C is a set that contains set D, and x is in D, then x is not necessarily in C unless C is a superset that includes all elements of D, but that's not automatic.\n\nIn knowledge representation, we often assume that categories have instances, and if a category is a subcategory of another, then instances of the subcategory are instances of the supercategory.\n\nBut here, the relationship is not explicitly \"subcategory\" but \"belongs to category\", which might be similar.\n\nLet's see the note: \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". The word \"contained\" might mean \"is a subset of\".\n\nSo for example, if A is contained in B, then A is a subset of B, so if x is in A, then x is in B.\n\nBut if A belongs to category B, then A is an instance of B, so if x is in A, it doesn't mean x is in B.\n\nIn the given, \"pestpus is babxpus\" – is this \"belongs to\" or \"contained in\"? The note says it can mean either, but we need to know which one it is.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps from the context, we can assume that \"is\" means either membership or subset, but for the purpose of this problem, we might need to interpret it consistently.\n\nLet's look at the statement: \"pestpus is babxpus and fomdpus and hecjpus\" – if pestpus is contained in babxpus, that would mean pestpus is a subset of babxpus, so any member of pestpus is also a member of babxpus. Then since x is a member of pestpus, x would be a member of babxpus.\n\nIf pestpus belongs to babxpus as a member, then pestpus is an element of babxpus, and x is an element of pestpus, so x may not be an element of babxpus.\n\nSimilarly for the other categories.\n\nThe question is about x being in babdpus or babqpus or babxpus.\n\nWe have no information about babdpus or babqpus, so we don't know if x is in them.\n\nBut for babxpus, if \"pestpus is babxpus\" means pestpus is a subset of babxpus, then x is in babxpus.\n\nIf it means pestpus is a member of babxpus, then x may not be in babxpus.\n\nThe note says \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\", so it could be interpreted either way.\n\nBut in the given, for \"x is pestpus\", since x is likely an individual, and pestpus is a category, \"x is pestpus\" probably means x belongs to category pestpus, so x is a member of pestpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"pestpus is babxpus\" could mean pestpus belongs to category babxpus, so pestpus is a member of babxpus.\n\nThen, from x member of pestpus and pestpus member of babxpus, we cannot infer that x member of babxpus.\n\nTherefore, it is unknown if x is babxpus.\n\nMoreover, we have no information about babdpus or babqpus, so we don't know if x is in those.\n\nThus, the statement is unknown.\n\nBut let's see if there is any other clue.\n\nThe given information also says that pestpus is fomdpus and hecjpus, but that doesn't help with babxpus.\n\nAnd x is fucdpus, which is unrelated.\n\nSo, based on the membership chain not being transitive, we cannot conclude that x is in babxpus.\n\nTherefore, the truth value is unknown.\n\nBut perhaps in this context, we are to assume that \"is\" implies transitivity for categories.\n\nI recall that in some logic puzzles, \"is\" might mean \"is a type of\" which is transitive.\n\nBut the note explicitly says \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\", which suggests two different meanings.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's see the question: \"x is babdpus or babqpus or babxpus?\"\n\nWe need to see if x is in any of these categories.\n\nFrom given, x is in pestpus, and pestpus is in babxpus? But as above, that doesn't imply x is in babxpus.\n\nUnless \"pestpus is babxpus\" means that pestpus is a subset of babxpus, so all members of pestpus are members of babxpus.\n\nThe note says \"A is contained in B\" which means subset, so if \"is\" can mean that, then for \"pestpus is babxpus\", it might mean pestpus is contained in babxpus, so subset.\n\nBut in the same sentence, pestpus is also fomdpus and hecjpus, so if it means subset, then pestpus is subset of babxpus, subset of fomdpus, and subset of hecjpus, which is possible if these categories overlap.\n\nThen for x, since x is in pestpus, and pestpus subset of babxpus, then x is in babxpus.\n\nSo in that case, x is babxpus, so the statement is true.\n\nBut if \"is\" means membership, then not necessarily.\n\nThe note says \"or\", so it can be either, but we need to know which one is intended.\n\nPerhaps from the way it is phrased, \"pestpus is babxpus\" likely means that pestpus is a category that is classified under babxpus, so membership for categories, but for individuals, it might be different.\n\nLet's look at the second part: \"x is pestpus and fucdpus\" – here, x is an individual, so \"x is pestpus\" means x belongs to category pestpus, so membership.\n\nSimilarly, \"pestpus is babxpus\" means pestpus belongs to category babxpus, so membership.\n\nSo consistently, \"A is B\" means A is a member of B.\n\nTherefore, from x member of pestpus and pestpus member of babxpus, no inference that x member of babxpus.\n\nThus, it is unknown if x is babxpus.\n\nAnd for babdpus and babqpus, no information, so unknown.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be unknown.\n\nBut let's see the question: \"x is babdpus or babqpus or babxpus?\" \n\nSince we don't know about babdpus and babqpus, and we don't know for sure about babxpus, it is unknown.\n\nSo I think that's the reasoning.",

    "Therefore, since we only know that pestpus is in babxpus, and x is in pestpus, we cannot conclude that x is in babxpus, because babxpus might be a category of categories, not of x.",
    "For example, if babxpus is \"animals\", pestpus is \"dogs\", and x is \"Fido\", then dogs are animals, and Fido is a dog, so Fido is an animal.",
    "But in that case, \"is\" means \"is a type of\", which is transitive.",
    "But in this context, the note says \"A belongs to category B\", which for \"dogs are animals\" would mean dogs belong to the category animals, which is true, and then \"Fido is a dog\" means Fido belongs to the category dogs, so Fido belongs to animals.",
    "So if \"is\" means \"is a member of the category\", and categories can contain both individuals and other categories, then if a category C contains category D, and D contains individual x, then x is in C only if C is a category that includes all members of its subcategories, which is usually the case in taxonomy.",
    "But in strict set theory, if C is a set that contains set D, and x is in D, then x is not necessarily in C unless C is a superset that includes all elements of D, but that's not automatic.",
    "In knowledge representation, we often assume that categories have instances, and if a category is a subcategory of another, then instances of the subcategory are instances of the supercategory.",
    "But here, the relationship is not explicitly \"subcategory\" but \"belongs to category\", which might be similar.",
    "Let's see the note: \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\".",
    "The word \"contained\" might mean \"is a subset of\".",
    "So for example, if A is contained in B, then A is a subset of B, so if x is in A, then x is in B.",
    "But if A belongs to category B, then A is an instance of B, so if x is in A, it doesn't mean x is in B.",
    "In the given, \"pestpus is babxpus\" – is this \"belongs to\" or \"contained in\"?",
    "The note says it can mean either, but we need to know which one it is.",
    "This is ambiguous.",
    "Perhaps from the context, we can assume that \"is\" means either membership or subset, but for the purpose of this problem, we might need to interpret it consistently.",
    "Let's look at the statement: \"pestpus is babxpus and fomdpus and hecjpus\" – if pestpus is contained in babxpus, that would mean pestpus is a subset of babxpus, so any member of pestpus is also a member of babxpus.",
    "Then since x is a member of pestpus, x would be a member of babxpus.",
    "If pestpus belongs to babxpus as a member, then pestpus is an element of babxpus, and x is an element of pestpus, so x may not be an element of babxpus.",
    "Similarly for the other categories.",
    "The question is about x being in babdpus or babqpus or babxpus.",
    "We have no information about babdpus or babqpus, so we don't know if x is in them.",
    "But for babxpus, if \"pestpus is babxpus\" means pestpus is a subset of babxpus, then x is in babxpus.",
    "If it means pestpus is a member of babxpus, then x may not be in babxpus.",
    "The note says \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\", so it could be interpreted either way.",
    "But in the given, for \"x is pestpus\", since x is likely an individual, and pestpus is a category, \"x is pestpus\" probably means x belongs to category pestpus, so x is a member of pestpus.",
    "Similarly, \"pestpus is babxpus\" could mean pestpus belongs to category babxpus, so pestpus is a member of babxpus.",
    "Then, from x member of pestpus and pestpus member of babxpus, we cannot infer that x member of babxpus.",
    "Therefore, it is unknown if x is babxpus.",
    "Moreover, we have no information about babdpus or babqpus, so we don't know if x is in those.",
    "Thus, the statement is unknown.",
    "But let's see if there is any other clue.",
    "The given information also says that pestpus is fomdpus and hecjpus, but that doesn't help with babxpus.",
    "And x is fucdpus, which is unrelated.",
    "So, based on the membership chain not being transitive, we cannot conclude that x is in babxpus.",
    "Therefore, the truth value is unknown.",
    "But perhaps in this context, we are to assume that \"is\" implies transitivity for categories.",
    "I recall that in some logic puzzles, \"is\" might mean \"is a type of\" which is transitive.",
    "But the note explicitly says \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\", which suggests two different meanings.",
    "To avoid confusion, let's see the question: \"x is babdpus or babqpus or babxpus?",
    "\"",
    "We need to see if x is in any of these categories.",
    "From given, x is in pestpus, and pestpus is in babxpus?",
    "But as above, that doesn't imply x is in babxpus.",
    "Unless \"pestpus is babxpus\" means that pestpus is a subset of babxpus, so all members of pestpus are members of babxpus.",
    "The note says \"A is contained in B\" which means subset, so if \"is\" can mean that, then for \"pestpus is babxpus\", it might mean pestpus is contained in babxpus, so subset.",
    "But in the same sentence, pestpus is also fomdpus and hecjpus, so if it means subset, then pestpus is subset of babxpus, subset of fomdpus, and subset of hecjpus, which is possible if these categories overlap.",
    "Then for x, since x is in pestpus, and pestpus subset of babxpus, then x is in babxpus.",
    "So in that case, x is babxpus, so the statement is true.",
    "But if \"is\" means membership, then not necessarily.",
    "The note says \"or\", so it can be either, but we need to know which one is intended.",
    "Perhaps from the way it is phrased, \"pestpus is babxpus\" likely means that pestpus is a category that is classified under babxpus, so membership for categories, but for individuals, it might be different.",
    "Let's look at the second part: \"x is pestpus and fucdpus\" – here, x is an individual, so \"x is pestpus\" means x belongs to category pestpus, so membership.",
    "Similarly, \"pestpus is babxpus\" means pestpus belongs to category babxpus, so membership.",
    "So consistently, \"A is B\" means A is a member of B.",
    "Therefore, from x member of pestpus and pestpus member of babxpus, no inference that x member of babxpus.",
    "Thus, it is unknown if x is babxpus.",
    "And for babdpus and babqpus, no information, so unknown.",
    "Therefore, the answer should be unknown.",
    "But let's see the question: \"x is babdpus or babqpus or babxpus?",
    "\"",
    "Since we don't know about babdpus and babqpus, and we don't know for sure about babxpus, it is unknown.",
    "So I think that's the reasoning."

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo I think that's the reasoning.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

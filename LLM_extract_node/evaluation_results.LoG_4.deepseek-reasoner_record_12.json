  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the relationships. The statements are of the form \"A is B\", which means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, it's about set membership or categorization.\n\nList out all the statements:\n\n1. tuplpus is tekdpus.\n\n2. pedppus is lixxpus.\n\n3. zagspus is mawhpus.\n\n4. lesdpus is furgpus.\n\n5. x is lesdpus and sutmpus.

(ticxpus belongs to both zagspus and komcpus.)\n\n9. tekdpus is pedppus.\n\n10. lixxpus is ticxpus.\n\nThe question is: Is x is babdpus? Meaning, does x belong to babdpus?\n\nI need to trace the connections from x to babdpus.\n\nStart with x. From statement 5: x is lesdpus and sutmpus. So, x belongs to lesdpus.\n\nFrom statement 4: lesdpus is furgpus. So, since x is lesdpus, and lesdpus is furgpus, that means x is furgpus? But careful: \"lesdpus is furgpus\" means lesdpus belongs to furgpus, so lesdpus is a subset of furgpus or a member? The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so it might imply that A is an instance of B or a subset. But in logic, we need to see the chain.\n\nTypically, if A is B, and B is C, then A is C? But since \"is\" means belongs to, it might not be transitive if we think in terms of set membership versus subset relation.\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". So, it could be that A is an element of B or A is a subset of B. But in common usage in such puzzles, it often implies a hierarchical relationship where if A is B, and B is C, then A is C, meaning that belonging is transitive.\n\nLet me see the statements. For example, from statement 1: tuplpus is tekdpus. And from statement 9: tekdpus is pedppus. So, if we assume transitivity, then tuplpus is pedppus? But we need to check if that holds.\n\nSimilarly, from statement 2: pedppus is lixxpus. And from statement 10: lixxpus is ticxpus. So pedppus is ticxpus? Then from statement 8: ticxpus is zagspus and komcpus, so pedppus is zagspus? But let's see.\n\nAlso, from statement 7: furgpus is tuplpus. And from statement 1: tuplpus is tekdpus, so furgpus is tekdpus? Then from statement 9: tekdpus is pedppus, so furgpus is pedppus? And so on.\n\nBut for x, we need to see if x is babdpus.\n\nbabdpus is mentioned in statement 6: zagspus is babdpus. So zagspus belongs to babdpus.\n\nSo, if we can show that x is zagspus or something that leads to zagspus, then x might be babdpus.\n\nBut let's list all the categories and see the connections.\n\nI am considering building a chain or a graph.\n\nStart from x:\n\nx is lesdpus (from 5)\n\nlesdpus is furgpus (from 4)\n\nfurgpus is tuplpus (from 7)\n\ntuplpus is tekdpus (from 1)\n\ntekdpus is pedppus (from 9)\n\npedppus is lixxpus (from 2)\n\nlixxpus is ticxpus (from 10)\n\nticxpus is zagspus (from 8, since ticxpus is zagspus and komcpus, so it is zagspus)\n\nNow, zagspus is babdpus (from 6)\n\nSo, if we assume that \"is\" is transitive, meaning that if A is B and B is C, then A is C, then we can chain this together.\n\nSo from above: x is lesdpus, lesdpus is furgpus, so x is furgpus? But careful: when we say \"lesdpus is furgpus\", it means lesdpus belongs to furgpus, so if x is lesdpus, then x is also belonging to furgpus? Actually, if lesdpus is a member of furgpus, and x is a member of lesdpus, then x might not directly be a member of furgpus unless lesdpus is a subset or something. But the note says \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". So, if A is contained in B, then if x is A, then x is contained in B? That would imply transitivity.\n\nIn common interpretation of such puzzles, \"is\" for categories is often transitive. For example, if \"dog is animal\" and \"animal is living thing\", then \"dog is living thing\". So I think we can assume transitivity here.\n\nSimilarly, in the statements, we have multiple chains that seem to imply transitivity.\n\nFor instance, from statement 8: ticxpus is zagspus, and from statement 10: lixxpus is ticxpus, so lixxpus is zagspus? And from statement 2: pedppus is lixxpus, so pedppus is zagspus? And from statement 9: tekdpus is pedppus, so tekdpus is zagspus? And so on.\n\nSo, for x, we have:\n\nx is lesdpus\n\nlesdpus is furgpus → so x is furgpus? Since lesdpus is contained in furgpus, and x is contained in lesdpus, so x is contained in furgpus.\n\nSimilarly, furgpus is tuplpus → so x is tuplpus? And so on.\n\nSo let's write the chain:\n\nx is lesdpus\n\nlesdpus is furgpus ⇒ x is furgpus\n\nfurgpus is tuplpus ⇒ x is tuplpus\n\ntuplpus is tekdpus ⇒ x is tekdpus\n\ntekdpus is pedppus ⇒ x is pedppus\n\npedppus is lixxpus ⇒ x is lixxpus\n\nlixxpus is ticxpus ⇒ x is ticxpus\n\nticxpus is zagspus ⇒ x is zagspus  (since ticxpus is zagspus, meaning ticxpus belongs to zagspus, so x belonging to ticxpus implies x belongs to zagspus? But careful: if ticxpus is a category, and x is ticxpus, meaning x is in ticxpus, and ticxpus is in zagspus, then x is in zagspus only if zagspus contains all elements of ticxpus, which it does if \"is\" means subset.\n\nSince \"ticxpus is zagspus\" means ticxpus is contained in zagspus, so yes, if x is in ticxpus, then x is in zagspus.\n\nSo, x is zagspus.\n\nNow, zagspus is babdpus (from statement 6) ⇒ so x is babdpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babdpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any contradictions or missing links.\n\nWe also have that x is sutmpus from statement 5, but sutmpus doesn't seem related to babdpus, so we can ignore it for this question.\n\nAlso, from statement 3: zagspus is mawhpus, but that doesn't affect whether x is babdpus.\n\nAnd from statement 8, ticxpus is also komcpus, but again, not relevant.\n\nSo, the chain from x to babdpus seems solid.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babdpus.",

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nBut careful: if ticxpus is a category, and x is ticxpus, meaning x is in ticxpus, and ticxpus is in zagspus, then x is in zagspus only if zagspus contains all elements of ticxpus, which it does if \"is\" means subset.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

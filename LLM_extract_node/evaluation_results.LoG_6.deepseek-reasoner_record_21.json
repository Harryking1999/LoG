(from \"x is fahnpus\")\n\n- x is gujkpus and mujspus. (from \"x is gujkpus and mujspus\")\n\nBut I need to find out if x is in the categories babgpus, babrpus, and babspus.\n\nI should list out all the relationships and see how these categories are connected.\n\nStart with babgpus:\n\nFrom \"wobypus is babgpus\" and \"puwhpus is wobypus\", so puwhpus is wobypus, and wobypus is babgpus, so puwhpus is babgpus? But note: \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if wobypus is babgpus, that means wobypus is a type of babgpus, or wobypus is contained in babgpus. Similarly, puwhpus is wobypus, so puwhpus is also in wobypus, which means puwhpus is in babgpus? Let's think carefully.\n\nIf A is B, it means A is a subset of B or A is an instance of B. But in this context, it might be that categories contain other categories or items.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll assume that \"A is B\" means that A is a member of category B, so B is a broader category that includes A.\n\nSo, from \"wobypus is babgpus\" – wobypus is a member of babgpus category.\n\nThen \"puwhpus is wobypus\" – puwhpus is a member of wobypus category. So, since wobypus is a member of babgpus, that means puwhpus is also a member of babgpus? Not necessarily directly, but through wobypus. If wobypus is a category that contains puwhpus, and wobypus itself is in babgpus, then puwhpus should be in babgpus as well. Similarly, if we have chains.\n\nI think we need to infer the membership recursively.\n\nSimilarly for other categories.\n\nNow, for babrpus: from \"puwhpus is babrpus and defhpus\" so directly, puwhpus is babrpus, meaning puwhpus is a member of babrpus category.\n\nAnd for babspus: from \"hofspus is babspus and nerqpus and pifppus and kanfpus\" and \"quyjpus is hofspus\" so quyjpus is hofspus, and hofspus is babspus, so quyjpus is babspus.\n\nBut we need to see if x is in these categories.\n\nx is given as fahnpus and gujkpus and mujspus.\n\nFirst, let's see what x is connected to.\n\nFrom x is fahnpus, and fahnpus is feygpus (from \"fahnpus is feygpus\"), so x is feygpus.\n\nfeygpus is zufgpus (from \"feygpus is zufgpus\"), so x is zufgpus.\n\nzufgpus is qohvpus (from \"zufgpus is qohvpus\"), so x is qohvpus.\n\nqohvpus is pikvpus (from \"qohvpus is pikvpus\"), so x is pikvpus.\n\npikvpus is vazxpus and siwrpus (from \"pikvpus is vazxpus and siwrpus\"), so x is vazxpus and siwrpus.\n\nvazxpus is quyjpus (from \"vazxpus is quyjpus\"), so x is quyjpus.\n\nquyjpus is hofspus (from \"quyjpus is hofspus\"), so x is hofspus.\n\nhofspus is babspus and nerqpus and pifppus and kanfpus (from \"hofspus is babspus and nerqpus and pifppus and kanfpus\"), so since x is hofspus, x is babspus.\n\nSo, we have that x is babspus.

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nNow, to box the answer.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

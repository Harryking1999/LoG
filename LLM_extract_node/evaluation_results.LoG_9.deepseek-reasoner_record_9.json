  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x belongs to babbpus, babmpus, or babnpus. From the given information, I see that x is defined as yatgpus. So, x is yatgpus.\n\nNow, I need to trace what yatgpus is. Looking at the information: \"yatgpus is rilfpus and qivspus.\" But since \"is\" here means belongs to or is contained in, yatgpus might be part of multiple categories. However, for the question, I need to see if x is in babbpus or babmpus or babnpus.\n\nI notice that babbpus is mentioned in the context of fagvpus: \"fagvpus is babbpus and micfpus and qodfpus.\" And fagvpus is related to xetbpus: \"xetbpus is fagvpus.\" And hejrpus includes xetbpus: \"hejrpus is xetbpus and wigypus.\" And wufdpus includes hejrpus: \"wufdpus is hejrpus.\" And vablpus includes wufdpus: \"vablpus is wufdpus and giqspus.\" And sizvpus is vablpus: \"sizvpus is vablpus.\" And leslpus is sizvpus: \"leslpus is sizvpus.\" And fognpus is leslpus: \"fognpus is leslpus.\" And curspus includes fognpus: \"curspus is fognpus and bihjpus.\" And ludxpus includes curspus: \"ludxpus is curspus and nofrpus and terspus.\" And kagfpus is ludxpus: \"kagfpus is ludxpus.\" And letlpus is kagfpus: \"letlpus is kagfpus.\" And japgpus is letlpus: \"japgpus is letlpus.\" And yajwpus is japgpus: \"yajwpus is japgpus.\" And vixjpus is yajwpus: \"vixjpus is yajwpus.\" And hafdpus is vixjpus: \"hafdpus is vixjpus.\" And cadxpus includes hafdpus: \"cadxpus is hafdpus and jayxpus and qolypus.\" And caqspus includes cadxpus: \"caqspus is cadxpus and waczpus.\" And qaswpus includes caqspus: \"qaswpus is caqspus and dilzpus and kazqpus.\" And secrpus is qaswpus: \"secrpus is qaswpus.\" And yecppus includes secrpus: \"yecppus is secrpus and zunqpus.\" And jixspus is yecppus: \"jixspus is yecppus.\" And kawlpus is jixspus: \"kawlpus is jixspus.\" And tanhpus is kawlpus: \"tanhpus is kawlpus.\" And setmpus is tanhpus: \"setmpus is tanhpus.\" And datqpus is setmpus: \"datqpus is setmpus.\" But datqpus is also rijcpus: \"datqpus is rijcpus.\" And rijcpus is yehjpus and wobqpus: \"rijcpus is yehjpus and wobqpus.\" This seems messy, and I'm not sure if this leads to babbpus.\n\nI need to focus on babbpus directly. babbpus is part of fagvpus, and fagvpus is part of xetbpus, which is part of hejrpus, which is part of wufdpus, which is part of vablpus, and so on. But x is yatgpus, which is rilfpus and qivspus.\n\nNow, what is rilfpus? \"rilfpus is disypus.\" And disypus is jayfpus and hehzpus: \"disypus is jayfpus and hehzpus.\" jayfpus is winlpus and pehypus: \"jayfpus is winlpus and pehypus.\" winlpus is yexrpus: \"winlpus is yexrpus.\" yexrpus is rethpus: \"yexrpus is rethpus.\" rethpus is haplpus: \"rethpus is haplpus.\" haplpus is sogxpus and tezhpus: \"haplpus is sogxpus and tezhpus.\" sogxpus is zulnpus: \"sogxpus is zulnpus.\" zulnpus is zosvpus and wiskpus: \"zulnpus is zosvpus and wiskpus.\" zosvpus is tacqpus: \"zosvpus is tacqpus.\" tacqpus is zizgpus and vuzcpus and pifcpus: \"tacqpus is zizgpus and vuzcpus and pifcpus.\" zizgpus is hukvpus: \"zizgpus is hukvpus.\" hukvpus is xucppus: \"hukvpus is xucppus.\" xucppus is negkpus: \"xucppus is negkpus.\" negkpus is mibtpus: \"negkpus is mibtpus.\" mibtpus is quztpus and vamkpus: \"mibtpus is quztpus and vamkpus.\" quztpus is sozwpus: \"quztpus is sozwpus.\" sozwpus is julgpus and zetwpus and yuxspus: \"sozwpus is julgpus and zetwpus and yuxspus.\" julgpus is doflpus: \"julgpus is doflpus.\" but also \"julgpus is zudkpus and xesfpus\" – wait, there might be multiple definitions? No, \"is\" means belongs to, so julgpus can belong to multiple categories.\n\nThis is getting very complicated. I might need to find a shorter path or see if there's a connection to babbpus.\n\nPerhaps I should look for babmpus or babnpus. From the information, I see bibmpus and bibwpus, but not babmpus or babnpus. The question is about babbpus or babmpus or babnpus. I see babbpus mentioned, but not babmpus or babnpus. So, for babmpus and babnpus, since they are not mentioned in the given information, it might be unknown if x is in them.\n\nBut let's confirm if babbpus is connected to x.\n\nx is yatgpus, and yatgpus is rilfpus and qivspus. rilfpus is disypus, and disypus includes hehzpus, but hehzpus is not defined anywhere? From the list, hehzpus is not mentioned in the given information. Similarly, qivspus is not defined. So, I don't know what hehzpus or qivspus is.\n\nTherefore, for x to be babbpus, I need to see if yatgpus is connected to babbpus through any chain.\n\nBut from the chains I started, it seems far fetched. Let's list all the categories that are connected to babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is a category under fagvpus. fagvpus is under xetbpus. xetbpus is under hejrpus. hejrpus is under wufdpus. wufdpus is under vablpus. vablpus is under sizvpus. sizvpus is under leslpus. leslpus is under fognpus. fognpus is under curspus. curspus is under ludxpus. ludxpus is under kagfpus. kagfpus is under letlpus. letlpus is under japgpus. japgpus is under yajwpus. yajwpus is under vixjpus. vixjpus is under hafdpus. hafdpus is under cadxpus. cadxpus is under caqspus. caqspus is under qaswpus. qaswpus is under secrpus. secrpus is under yecppus. yecppus is under jixspus. jixspus is under kawlpus. kawlpus is under tanhpus. tanhpus is under setmpus. setmpus is under datqpus. datqpus is under rijcpus or under setmpus? datqpus is setmpus, so it is under itself? No, datqpus is setmpus, meaning datqpus belongs to setmpus, so setmpus is a category containing datqpus.\n\nBut from here, where does this connect to yatgpus? yatgpus is rilfpus, and rilfpus is disypus, and disypus is jayfpus and hehzpus. jayfpus is winlpus and pehypus, winlpus is yexrpus, yexrpus is rethpus, rethpus is haplpus, haplpus is sogxpus and tezhpus, sogxpus is zulnpus, zulnpus is zosvpus and wiskpus, zosvpus is tacqpus, tacqpus is zizgpus and vuzcpus and pifcpus, zizgpus is hukvpus, hukvpus is xucppus, xucppus is negkpus, negkpus is mibtpus, mibtpus is quztpus and vamkpus, quztpus is sozwpus, sozwpus is julgpus and zetwpus and yuxspus, julgpus is doflpus or zudkpus and xesfpus, doflpus is nugxpus and kirlpus, nugxpus is qitdpus and surppus, qitdpus is kitwpus, kitwpus is sazhpus, sazhpus is jekzpus, jekzpus is norzpus and japmpus, norzpus is jefspus, jefspus is cotbpus, etc. This doesn't seem to connect to the chain from babbpus.\n\nPerhaps there is another way. Notice that in the chain from babbpus, we have datqpus, which is also rijcpus, but rijcpus is yehjpus and wobqpus, which doesn't help.\n\nAlso, from yatgpus, we have qivspus, which is not defined, so I have no information about qivspus.\n\nTherefore, it seems that there is no clear path from x to babbpus. Similarly, babmpus and babnpus are not mentioned at all in the given information, so I have no idea if x belongs to them.\n\nThus, the answer should be unknown.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any connection I missed. From the beginning, x is yatgpus, and yatgpus is rilfpus and qivspus. rilfpus is disypus, and disypus is jayfpus and hehzpus. jayfpus is winlpus and pehypus. winlpus is yexrpus. yexrpus is rethpus. rethpus is haplpus. haplpus is sogxpus and tezhpus. sogxpus is zulnpus. zulnpus is zosvpus and wiskpus. zosvpus is tacqpus. tacqpus is zizgpus and vuzcpus and pifcpus. zizgpus is hukvpus. hukvpus is xucppus. xucppus is negkpus. negkpus is mibtpus. mibtpus is quztpus and vamkpus. quztpus is sozwpus. sozwpus is julgpus and zetwpus and yuxspus. julgpus is doflpus? But also julgpus is zudkpus and xesfpus.\n\ndoflpus is nugxpus and kirlpus. nugxpus is qitdpus and surppus. qitdpus is kitwpus. kitwpus is sazhpus. sazhpus is jekzpus. jekzpus is norzpus and japmpus. norzpus is jefspus. jefspus is cotbpus. cotbpus is not connected to babbpus.\n\nFrom sozwpus, julgpus is also zudkpus and xesfpus. zudkpus is bibwpus. bibwpus is fulhpus. fulhpus is bevhpus. bevhpus is berxpus and filkpus. berxpus is bibmpus and valrpus. bibmpus is kusrpus and recnpus. kusrpus is qodrpus. qodrpus is miyfpus and leztpus and soydpus. miyfpus is mefspus and pizlpus. mefspus is cazypus. cazypus is nocdpus. nocdpus is neyvpus. neyvpus is xidqpus and beqlpus and nisdpus. xidqpus is niqppus. niqppus is fuznpus and dumrpus. fuznpus is dobvpus. dobvpus is barlpus. barlpus is febcpus? wait, \"barlpus is febcpus\" but also \"barlpus is mamlpus\" – multiple belonging.\n\nbarlpus is febcpus? From \"dobvpus is barlpus\" and \"fuznpus is dobvpus\" so barlpus is a category, but from \"barlpus is febcpus\" meaning barlpus belongs to febcpus? But febcpus is fecnpus and rejbpus, etc. This doesn't connect to babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is only mentioned in fagvpus, and fagvpus is from xetbpus, which is from hejrpus, which is from wufdpus, which is from vablpus, which is from sizvpus, which is from leslpus, which is from fognpus, which is from curspus, which is from ludxpus, which is from kagfpus, which is from letlpus, which is from japgpus, which is from yajwpus, which is from vixjpus, which is from hafdpus, which is from cadxpus, which is from caqspus, which is from qaswpus, which is from secrpus, which is from yecppus, which is from jixspus, which is from kawlpus, which is from tanhpus, which is from setmpus, which is from datqpus. But datqpus is also setmpus, so it's circular? datqpus is setmpus, meaning datqpus is contained in setmpus, so setmpus contains datqpus. But from the chain, we have setmpus containing datqpus, but datqpus is also contained in rijcpus? \"datqpus is rijcpus\" meaning datqpus belongs to rijcpus, so rijcpus contains datqpus.\n\nBut where is yatgpus? yatgpus is rilfpus, and rilfpus is disypus, and disypus is jayfpus and hehzpus. jayfpus is winlpus and pehypus, winlpus is yexrpus, etc., as before. No connection to datqpus or any part of the babbpus chain.\n\nTherefore, there is no known connection between x and babbpus.\n\nSince babmpus and babnpus are not mentioned, it is unknown if x is in them.\n\nSo, the answer should be unknown.",

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, the answer should be unknown.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

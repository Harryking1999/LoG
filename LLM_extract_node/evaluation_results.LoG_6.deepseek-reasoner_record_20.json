The information states relationships like \"borzpus is nevtpus\" which means borzpus belongs to the category nevtpus.\n\nLet me list out all the given statements:\n\n1. borzpus is nevtpus.\n\n2. zetspus is babgpus.\n\n3. borzpus is lagwpus.\n\n4. x is mesdpus and kuwqpus.\n\n5. zetspus is pahgpus and yupgpus.\n\n6. qurkpus is ginxpus.\n\n7. nevtpus is yoynpus.\n\n8. qurkpus is lugmpus.\n\n9. ginxpus is borzpus and yoycpus.\n\n10. mesdpus is qipppus and kujgpus and ciwnpus.\n\n11. qipppus is qurkpus and gazqpus.\n\n12. yoynpus is zetspus.\n\nI need to find if x is babgpus. From statement 2, zetspus is babgpus, so if x is related to zetspus, I might find a connection.\n\nI also know from statement 4 that x is mesdpus and kuwqpus. So x belongs to mesdpus and kuwqpus.\n\nNow, I need to see if mesdpus or kuwqpus is connected to babgpus.\n\nLet me trace the categories.\n\nStart with babgpus: from statement 2, zetspus is babgpus. So babgpus contains zetspus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is in babgpus, meaning x should be connected to zetspus or directly to babgpus.\n\nNow, from statement 12, yoynpus is zetspus. So yoynpus contains zetspus.\n\nFrom statement 7, nevtpus is yoynpus, so nevtpus contains yoynpus.\n\nFrom statement 1, borzpus is nevtpus, so borzpus is in nevtpus.\n\nFrom statement 9, ginxpus is borzpus and yoycpus. So ginxpus contains borzpus.\n\nFrom statement 6, qurkpus is ginxpus, so qurkpus is in ginxpus.\n\nFrom statement 11, qipppus is qurkpus and gazqpus, so qipppus contains qurkpus.\n\nFrom statement 10, mesdpus is qipppus and kujgpus and ciwnpus, so mesdpus contains qipppus.\n\nAnd from statement 4, x is mesdpus, so x is in mesdpus.\n\nSince mesdpus contains qipppus, and qipppus contains qurkpus, and qurkpus is in ginxpus, and ginxpus contains borzpus, and borzpus is in nevtpus, and nevtpus is in yoynpus, and yoynpus is in zetspus, and zetspus is in babgpus.\n\nSo, through this chain, x is in mesdpus, which is part of a chain that leads to babgpus.\n\nBut I need to confirm if x is directly in babgpus or if the chain implies that x is contained in babgpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babgpus?\" meaning does x belong to babgpus.\n\nSince babgpus contains zetspus, and zetspus contains yoynpus, and so on, down to mesdpus containing x, so ultimately, x should be contained in babgpus through the hierarchy.\n\nLet me map out the containment.\n\nWe have:\n\nbabgpus contains zetspus (from 2)\n\nzetspus contains yoynpus? No, from statement 12: yoynpus is zetspus, which means yoynpus belongs to zetspus, so zetspus contains yoynpus.\n\nSimilarly, yoynpus contains nevtpus? From statement 7: nevtpus is yoynpus, so nevtpus belongs to yoynpus, meaning yoynpus contains nevtpus.\n\nnevtpus contains borzpus? From statement 1: borzpus is nevtpus, so borzpus belongs to nevtpus, meaning nevtpus contains borzpus.\n\nBut from statement 9: ginxpus is borzpus and yoycpus. This means ginxpus belongs to borzpus? No, let's read carefully.\n\n\"ginxpus is borzpus and yoycpus\" – according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so ginxpus belongs to borzpus? That seems backward because usually, we think of categories containing items, but here \"is\" means belongs to, so if A is B, then A is an instance of B, so B contains A.\n\nSo, for statement 9: \"ginxpus is borzpus and yoycpus\" means ginxpus belongs to borzpus and also to yoycpus. So borzpus contains ginxpus, and yoycpus contains ginxpus.\n\nBut from statement 1, borzpus is nevtpus, so borzpus belongs to nevtpus, meaning nevtpus contains borzpus.\n\nSo if nevtpus contains borzpus, and borzpus contains ginxpus, then nevtpus contains ginxpus? But we need to see the chain.\n\nSimilarly, from statement 6: \"qurkpus is ginxpus\" means qurkpus belongs to ginxpus, so ginxpus contains qurkpus.\n\nFrom statement 11: \"qipppus is qurkpus and gazqpus\" means qipppus belongs to qurkpus and to gazqpus, so qurkpus contains qipppus, and gazqpus contains qipppus.\n\nFrom statement 10: \"mesdpus is qipppus and kujgpus and ciwnpus\" means mesdpus belongs to qipppus, and to kujgpus, and to ciwnpus. So qipppus contains mesdpus, kujgpus contains mesdpus, ciwnpus contains mesdpus.\n\nFrom statement 4: \"x is mesdpus and kuwqpus\" means x belongs to mesdpus and to kuwqpus, so mesdpus contains x, and kuwqpus contains x.\n\nNow, we want to see if x belongs to babgpus, i.e., babgpus contains x.\n\nbabgpus contains zetspus (from 2)\n\nzetspus contains yoynpus (from 12, since yoynpus is zetspus, so zetspus contains yoynpus)\n\nyoynpus contains nevtpus (from 7, nevtpus is yoynpus, so yoynpus contains nevtpus)\n\nnevtpus contains borzpus (from 1, borzpus is nevtpus, so nevtpus contains borzpus)\n\nborzpus contains ginxpus (from 9, ginxpus is borzpus, so borzpus contains ginxpus)\n\nginxpus contains qurkpus (from 6, qurkpus is ginxpus, so ginxpus contains qurkpus)\n\nqurkpus contains qipppus (from 11, qipppus is qurkpus, so qurkpus contains qipppus)\n\nqipppus contains mesdpus (from 10, mesdpus is qipppus, so qipppus contains mesdpus)\n\nmesdpus contains x (from 4, x is mesdpus, so mesdpus contains x)\n\nTherefore, since containment is transitive, babgpus contains x through this chain.\n\nSo, x is contained in babgpus, meaning x is babgpus? The question is \"x is babgpus?\" which means x belongs to babgpus, so yes, it is true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other paths or contradictions.\n\nAlso, from statement 5, zetspus is pahgpus and yupgpus, but that doesn't affect the chain to babgpus.\n\nFrom statement 3, borzpus is lagwpus, which might mean borzpus also belongs to lagwpus, but that doesn't change the containment in babgpus.\n\nFrom statement 8, qurkpus is lugmpus, so qurkpus also belongs to lugmpus, but again, not relevant for babgpus.\n\nFrom statement 9, ginxpus is also yoycpus, but yoycpus isn't connected to babgpus in the given info, so we can ignore that.\n\nSo, the chain from babgpus to x is clear.\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.",

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the relationships given. The statements are of the form \"A is B\", which means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, it's about set membership or categorization.\n\nList out all the statements:\n\n1. joylpus is xucmpus.\n\n2. worjpus is wumkpus.\n\n3. xucmpus is gicypus.\n\n4. robwpus is worjpus and yizhpus. (This means robwpus belongs to both worjpus and yizhpus? Or is it that robwpus is a combination? Based on the note, it probably means robwpus is contained in both categories. But the word \"and\" might mean that robwpus is both worjpus and yizhpus, meaning it has both properties. Since it's about categories, I think \"robwpus is worjpus and yizhpus\" means that robwpus is a subset of worjpus and also a subset of yizhpus. But typically, in such logic, if we say \"A is B and C\", it might mean A is a type of B and also a type of C. So, for reasoning, I'll assume that \"A is B\" means A ⊆ B, and \"A is B and C\" means A ⊆ B and A ⊆ C.\n\nSimilarly, later we have \"x is joylpus and neqqpus\", which probably means x ⊆ joylpus and x ⊆ neqqpus.\n\nBut x is probably an instance, so x is a member of joylpus and neqqpus? The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or is contained in B. Since x is mentioned, it might be an individual, so \"x is joylpus\" means x is a member of joylpus.\n\nLet's clarify the notation. The note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, for categories, if A is a category, it might be contained in another category, but if A is an instance, it belongs to a category.\n\nIn the statements, we have things like joylpus, xucmpus, etc., which seem to be category names. And then we have x, which seems to be an instance.\n\nSo, for categories, \"joylpus is xucmpus\" means that the category joylpus is a subset of xucmpus, or that joylpus is contained in xucmpus. Similarly, \"worjpus is wumkpus\" means worjpus ⊆ wumkpus.\n\nBut when we have \"robwpus is worjpus and yizhpus\", it means robwpus ⊆ worjpus and robwpus ⊆ yizhpus.\n\nAnd for x, \"x is joylpus and neqqpus\" means x ∈ joylpus and x ∈ neqqpus.\n\nThe question is about x: \"Is it true or false or unknown: x is babdpus and babqpus and babxpus?\" which means x ∈ babdpus and x ∈ babqpus and x ∈ babxpus.\n\nSo, I need to find out if x is a member of these categories.\n\nNow, let's trace the relationships from x.\n\nWe know: x is joylpus and neqqpus. So x ∈ joylpus and x ∈ neqqpus.\n\nFrom statement 1: joylpus is xucmpus, so joylpus ⊆ xucmpus. Therefore, since x ∈ joylpus, x ∈ xucmpus.\n\nFrom statement 3: xucmpus is gicypus, so xucmpus ⊆ gicypus. Therefore, x ∈ gicypus.\n\nFrom statement: gicypus is gugqpus. Wait, is there such a statement? Let's see: \"gicypus is gugqpus.\" Yes, from the list: \"gicypus is gugqpus.\" So, gicypus ⊆ gugqpus. Therefore, since x ∈ gicypus, x ∈ gugqpus.\n\nNow, from statement: gugqpus is robwpus and rirppus. So, gugqpus ⊆ robwpus and gugqpus ⊆ rirppus? Or does it mean that gugqpus is contained in both? Based on the wording, \"gugqpus is robwpus and rirppus\" likely means that gugqpus is a subset of robwpus and also a subset of rirppus.\n\nBut let's confirm with other statements. For example, \"robwpus is worjpus and yizhpus\" which means robwpus ⊆ worjpus and robwpus ⊆ yizhpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"wumkpus is babdpus and babqpus and babxpus and bakspus\" which means wumkpus ⊆ babdpus and wumkpus ⊆ babqpus and wumkpus ⊆ babxpus and wumkpus ⊆ bakspus.\n\nSo, back to gugqpus: gugqpus is robwpus and rirppus, so gugqpus ⊆ robwpus and gugqpus ⊆ rirppus.\n\nTherefore, since x ∈ gugqpus, x ∈ robwpus and x ∈ rirppus? No: if gugqpus ⊆ robwpus, then any member of gugqpus is also a member of robwpus. So yes, x ∈ robwpus.\n\nSimilarly, x ∈ rirppus, but we don't care about rirppus for the question.\n\nNow, we have x ∈ robwpus.\n\nFrom statement 4: robwpus is worjpus and yizhpus, so robwpus ⊆ worjpus and robwpus ⊆ yizhpus. Therefore, since x ∈ robwpus, x ∈ worjpus and x ∈ yizhpus.\n\nNow, from statement 2: worjpus is wumkpus, so worjpus ⊆ wumkpus. Therefore, since x ∈ worjpus, x ∈ wumkpus.\n\nNow, from statement: wumkpus is babdpus and babqpus and babxpus and bakspus. So wumkpus ⊆ babdpus, wumkpus ⊆ babqpus, wumkpus ⊆ babxpus, and wumkpus ⊆ bakspus.\n\nTherefore, since x ∈ wumkpus, x ∈ babdpus, x ∈ babqpus, x ∈ babxpus, and x ∈ bakspus.\n\nThe question is whether x is babdpus and babqpus and babxpus, which we have just derived that x is in all of them.\n\nSo, it should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any missing links or contradictions.\n\nWe also have that x is neqqpus, but neqqpus doesn't seem to be connected to any other category, so it doesn't affect this reasoning.\n\nSimilarly, yizhpus and rirppus are not needed for this question.\n\nSo, based on the chain, x is in wumkpus, which is contained in babdpus, babqpus, and babxpus.\n\nTherefore, x is indeed a member of babdpus, babqpus, and babxpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nThe question says \"and babxpus?\" and I have babxpus included.\n\nIn the wumkpus statement, it says \"wumkpus is babdpus and babqpus and babxpus and bakspus\" so yes, babxpus is included.\n\nSo, for x, it is in all three.\n\nThus, it is true.",

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nThus, it is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

So, it's about set membership or hierarchy.\n\nI need to find out if x is babcpus. From the given information, x is jifcpus. So, x is a member of jifcpus.\n\nNow, I need to see if jifcpus is connected to babcpus somehow.\n\nLet me list out all the given statements:\n\n1. zottpus is babcpus and yutspus and xazxpus.\n\nThis means zottpus belongs to babcpus, yutspus, and xazxpus.

Since x is in jifcpus, I need to see if jifcpus is in babcpus or connected through other categories.\n\nLet me trace the path from jifcpus to babcpus.\n\nFrom 6: jifcpus is busdpus and navzpus. So jifcpus is contained in busdpus.\n\nFrom 8: busdpus is makvpus. So busdpus is contained in makvpus.\n\nFrom 4: makvpus is guytpus and cuzxpus and tomzpus. So makvpus is contained in guytpus.\n\nFrom 2: guytpus is nulgpus. So guytpus is contained in nulgpus.\n\nFrom 9: nulgpus is faxdpus and qaxqpus. So nulgpus is contained in faxdpus.\n\nFrom 3: faxdpus is rijxpus. So faxdpus is contained in rijxpus.\n\nFrom 5: rijxpus is wirfpus and pibmpus.

So in terms of sets, B is a superset of A.\n\nSo, from above, we have:\n\nx ∈ jifcpus\n\njifcpus ∈ busdpus  (since jifcpus is busdpus)\n\nbusdpus ∈ makvpus\n\nmakvpus ∈ guytpus\n\nguytpus ∈ nulgpus\n\nnulgpus ∈ faxdpus\n\nfaxdpus ∈ rijxpus\n\nrijxpus ∈ wirfpus\n\nwirfpus ∈ zottpus\n\nzottpus ∈ babcpus\n\nTherefore, by transitivity, x ∈ babcpus.\n\nSo, it should be true that x is babcpus.\n\nThe question is: Is it true or false or unknown: x is babcpus?\n\nBased on this, it is true.\n\nI should double-check if there are any other paths or contradictions. Also, note that in statement 1, zottpus is babcpus and yutspus and xazxpus, meaning zottpus is contained in all three, so babcpus contains zottpus, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, all other statements seem consistent.\n\nSo, I think it's true.",

IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, I think it's true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

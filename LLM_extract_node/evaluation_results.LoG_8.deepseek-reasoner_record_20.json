  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is either babbpus or babcpus. The given information tells me that x is qeylpus. So, x belongs to qeylpus.\n\nNow, from the information, qeylpus is buntpus. So, x is also buntpus because if x is qeylpus and qeylpus is buntpus, then x is buntpus.\n\nNext, buntpus is ruxdpus and vaqxpus. So, x is ruxdpus and vaqxpus? But since it's \"is\" meaning belongs to, buntpus belongs to both ruxdpus and vaqxpus, so x, being buntpus, also belongs to both.\n\nBut I need to see if x is babbpus or babcpus. I don't see babbpus mentioned anywhere in the given information. I see babcpus mentioned in the context of kalrpus.\n\nLet me trace through the information.\n\nI have kalrpus is babcpus and xitppus. And fitppus is kalrpus. And bolypus is fitppus. And tuzcpus is bolypus. And zevtpus is tuzcpus. And tiwjpus is zevtpus. And vonvpus is tiwjpus. And cihbpus is vonvpus. And semkpus is cihbpus and lelxpus and widjpus. And jarqpus is semkpus and hivxpus. And rimtpus is jarqpus and vifgpus and gakzpus. And fozzpus is rimtpus. And rojspus is fozzpus. And sosqpus is rojspus. And felcpus is sosqpus and bewppus. And gevdpus is zascpus. And zascpus is felcpus. Also, seddpus is gevdpus. And pitcpus is seddpus. And dorbpus is pitcpus. And woqxpus is dorbpus. And qetppus is woqxpus. And yavzpus is qetppus. And xivqpus is yavzpus. And weyvpus is xivqpus and loswpus. And jucgpus is weyvpus. And cegxpus is jucgpus and kulvpus. And wofhpus is cegxpus. And dixbpus is wofhpus. And kuvppus is dixbpus and xibfpus. And qogbpus is kuvppus and moxppus. And wogxpus is qogbpus. And nozdpus is wogxpus and qihypus and nujcpus and qikkpus. And fomvpus is gijfpus and neldpus. And kezfpus is fomvpus. And dudqpus is kezfpus and viyxpus. And lejjpus is dudqpus. And cevkpus is lejjpus and buwgpus. And yemtpus is cevkpus. And jijhpus is yemtpus. And fabrpus is jijhpus. And ruxdpus is fabrpus. And buntpus is ruxdpus and vaqxpus. And x is qeylpus, and qeylpus is buntpus.\n\nSo, x is ultimately connected to buntpus, which is connected to ruxdpus, which is connected to fabrpus, and so on. But I need babcpus.\n\nbabcp us is under kalrpus. kalrpus is part of fitppus, which is part of bolypus, and so on. But where is x in relation to this?\n\nx is from the other side: x -> qeylpus -> buntpus -> ruxdpus -> fabrpus -> jijhpus -> yemtpus -> cevkpus -> lejjpus -> dudqpus -> kezfpus -> fomvpus -> gijfpus -> nozdpus -> wogxpus -> qogbpus -> kuvppus -> dixbpus -> wofhpus -> cegxpus -> jucgpus -> weyvpus -> xivqpus -> yavzpus -> qetppus -> woqxpus -> dorbpus -> pitcpus -> seddpus -> gevdpus -> kucqpus -> kedbpus? Wait, gevdpus is also zascpus -> felcpus -> sosqpus -> rojspus -> fozzpus -> rimtpus -> jarqpus -> semkpus -> cihbpus -> vonvpus -> tiwjpus -> zevtpus -> tuzcpus -> bolypus -> fitppus -> kalrpus -> babcpus.\n\nSo, actually, through a long chain, x might be connected to babcpus? But let's see if there is a path from x to babcpus.\n\nFrom x: x is qeylpus -> buntpus -> ruxdpus -> fabrpus -> jijhpus -> yemtpus -> cevkpus -> lejjpus -> dudqpus -> kezfpus -> fomvpus -> gijfpus -> nozdpus -> wogxpus -> qogbpus -> kuvppus -> dixbpus -> wofhpus -> cegxpus -> jucgpus -> weyvpus -> xivqpus -> yavzpus -> qetppus -> woqxpus -> dorbpus -> pitcpus -> seddpus -> gevdpus -> kucqpus? But gevdpus is also zascpus -> felcpus -> sosqpus -> rojspus -> fozzpus -> rimtpus -> jarqpus -> semkpus -> cihbpus -> vonvpus -> tiwjpus -> zevtpus -> tuzcpus -> bolypus -> fitppus -> kalrpus -> babcpus.\n\nBut is gevdpus connected to both? gevdpus is seddpus? seddpus is gevdpus, and gevdpus is kucqpus? No, from above: seddpus is gevdpus, and gevdpus is zascpus, and zascpus is felcpus, etc.\n\nBut in the chain from x, we have seddpus is gevdpus, and then gevdpus is kucqpus? Let's see the given information.\n\nFrom given: seddpus is gevdpus. And gevdpus is kucqpus? I don't see that. Let's read carefully.\n\nI see: gevdpus is kucqpus. Is that stated? Let's check the given information.\n\nLook: \"gevdpus is kucqpus.\" No, in the given, I have \"kezfpus is fomvpus\" and \"kucqpus is kedbpus\" but not gevdpus is kucqpus.\n\nLet's list all \"is\" statements from the given.\n\nFrom given:\n\nsemkpus is cihbpus and lelxpus and widjpus.\n\nlejjpus is dudqpus.\n\nx is qeylpus.\n\nvonvpus is tiwjpus.\n\nnozdpus is wogxpus and qihypus and nujcpus and qikkpus.\n\nqeylpus is buntpus.\n\nyemtpus is cevkpus.\n\nqogbpus is kuvppus and moxppus.\n\nwoqxpus is dorbpus.\n\nsosqpus is xalypus.  // wait, but later sosqpus is also related to rojspus?

No, let's see: \"qetppus is wopspus\" is not there. From given: \"qetppus is woqxpus\" because later: \"yavzpus is qetppus\" and \"qetppus is woqxpus\" from? Wait, in the given: \"qetppus is wopspus\" is not stated. Let's read carefully.\n\nThe given says: \"qetppus is wopspus.\"? No, from the text: \"qetppus is wopspus\" is not present. Let's see the original given information.\n\nFrom the user's message: \"qetppus is wopspus.\" is not there. I think I misread.\n\nUser said: \"qetppus is wopspus.\"? Let's copy the given information:\n\n\"semkpus is cihbpus and lelxpus and widjpus. lejjpus is dudqpus. x is qeylpus. vonvpus is tiwjpus. nozdpus is wogxpus and qihypus and nujcpus and qikkpus. qeylpus is buntpus. yemtpus is cevkpus. qogbpus is kuvppus and moxppus. woqxpus is dorbpus. sosqpus is xalypus. dudqpus is kezfpus and viyxpus. fabrpus is jijhpus. jijhpus is yemtpus. xivqpus is zebtpus. pitcpus is seddpus. kezfpus is fomvpus. kucqpus is kedbpus. tiwjpus is zevtpus. rimtpus is jarqpus and vifgpus and gakzpus. dorbpus is pitcpus. seddpus is gevdpus. jarqpus is semkpus and hivxpus. ruxdpus is fabrpus. gijfpus is nozdpus. wogxpus is qogbpus. qetppus is wopspus. wofhpus is cegxpus. bolypus is fitppus. buntpus is ruxdpus and vaqxpus. jucgpus is weyvpus. xivqpus is yavzpus. yavzpus is qetppus. fozzpus is rimtpus. zebtpus is miwfpus and ruzspus. zevtpus is tuzcpus. kuvppus is dixbpus and xibfpus. qetppus is woqxpus. weyvpus is xivqpus and loswpus. rojspus is fozzpus. fitppus is kalrpus. gevdpus is kucqpus. cegxpus is jucgpus and kulvpus. cevkpus is lejjpus and buwgpus. sosqpus is rojspus. felcpus is sosqpus and bewppus. gevdpus is zascpus. miwfpus is kowdpus and povnpus. tuzcpus is bolypus. kalrpus is babcpus and xitppus. fomvpus is gijfpus and neldpus. dixbpus is wofhpus. zascpus is felcpus. cihbpus is vonvpus. kowdpus is pikppus and fasvpus.\"\n\nAh, here it is: \"qetppus is wopspus\" is not stated; instead, from the text: \"qetppus is woqxpus\" because later it says \"qetppus is woqxpus\" explicitly? Let's see: in the list, after \"yavzpus is qetppus\" and then \"fozzpus is rimtpus\" etc., but then later: \"qetppus is woqxpus\" is stated? In the user's message, it says: \"weyvpus is xivqpus and loswpus. rojspus is fozzpus. fitppus is kalrpus. gevdpus is kucqpus. cegxpus is jucgpus and kulvpus. cevkpus is lejjpus and buwgpus. sosqpus is rojspus. felcpus is sosqpus and bewppus. gevdpus is zascpus. miwfpus is kowdpus and povnpus. tuzcpus is bolypus. kalrpus is babcpus and xitppus. fomvpus is gijfpus and neldpus. dixbpus is wofhpus. zascpus is felcpus. cihbpus is vonvpus. kowdpus is pikppus and fasvpus.\"\n\nBut where is \"qetppus is woqxpus\"? Earlier in the list, I see \"woqxpus is dorbpus\" and then later \"yavzpus is qetppus\" and then after that, in the flow, but not \"qetppus is woqxpus\" explicitly? Let's read the user's message carefully.\n\nUser said: \"yavzpus is qetppus. fozzpus is rimtpus. zebtpus is miwfpus and ruzspus. zevtpus is tuzcpus. kuvppus is dixbpus and xibfpus. qetppus is woqxpus. weyvpus is xivqpus and loswpus. rojspus is fozzpus. ...\"\n\nYes! Here it is: \"qetppus is woqxpus.\" So, qetppus is woqxpus.\n\nSo, from yavzpus is qetppus, and qetppus is woqxpus, so yavzpus is woqxpus, etc.\n\nNow, back to the chain.\n\nx is qeylpus.\n\nqeylpus is buntpus.\n\nbuntpus is ruxdpus and vaqxpus. So x is ruxdpus and vaqxpus.\n\nruxdpus is fabrpus.\n\nfabrpus is jijhpus.\n\njijhpus is yemtpus.\n\nyemtpus is cevkpus.\n\ncevkpus is lejjpus and buwgpus.\n\nlejjpus is dudqpus.\n\ndudqpus is kezfpus and viyxpus.\n\nkezfpus is fomvpus.\n\nfomvpus is gijfpus and neldpus.\n\ngijfpus is nozdpus.\n\nnozdpus is wogxpus and qihypus and nujcpus and qikkpus.\n\nwogxpus is qogbpus.\n\nqogbpus is kuvppus and moxppus.\n\nkuvppus is dixbpus and xibfpus.\n\ndixbpus is wofhpus.\n\nwofhpus is cegxpus.\n\ncegxpus is jucgpus and kulvpus.\n\njucgpus is weyvpus.\n\nweyvpus is xivqpus and loswpus.\n\nxivqpus is yavzpus.  // from \"xivqpus is yavzpus\" given? User said: \"xivqpus is yavzpus\" yes, from \"xivqpus is yavzpus\" and also \"xivqpus is zebtpus\" earlier? Let's see: \"xivqpus is zebtpus\" is given, but then \"xivqpus is yavzpus\" is also given? User said: \"jucgpus is weyvpus. xivqpus is yavzpus. yavzpus is qetppus.\" So xivqpus is yavzpus.\n\nBut earlier, \"xivqpus is zebtpus\" is also given? User said: \"xivqpus is zebtpus\" before? Let's see: in the list, after \"jijhpus is yemtpus\" there is \"xivqpus is zebtpus\" and then \"pitcpus is seddpus\" etc. So xivqpus is both zebtpus and yavzpus? That might be possible if zebtpus and yavzpus are related, but from later, yavzpus is qetppus, and zebtpus is miwfpus and ruzspus, so they are different.\n\nBut in the \"is\" relation, it means xivqpus belongs to zebtpus and also belongs to yavzpus? So it can belong to multiple categories.\n\nSimilarly, from weyvpus is xivqpus and loswpus, so weyvpus belongs to xivqpus, meaning xivqpus is a category containing weyvpus? Let's clarify the meaning.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', so if A is B, then A is a member of B, so B is a category that contains A.\n\nSo, if we have \"xivqpus is zebtpus\" and \"xivqpus is yavzpus\", that means xivqpus belongs to both zebtpus and yavzpus, so zebtpus and yavzpus are categories that contain xivqpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"weyvpus is xivqpus and loswpus\" means weyvpus belongs to xivqpus and also to loswpus, so xivqpus contains weyvpus.\n\nSo, from weyvpus is xivqpus, and xivqpus is yavzpus, so weyvpus is also yavzpus? Since weyvpus belongs to xivqpus, and xivqpus belongs to yavzpus, then weyvpus belongs to yavzpus? But the relation is transitive? Not necessarily directly, but if A belongs to B and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C? In set theory, if B is a subset of C, then A in B implies A in C. But here, \"A is B\" means A is an element of B, so B is a set, and A is in B. But if B is in C, meaning B is an element of C, then A may not be in C unless C is a set of sets or something. But in this context, since it's categories, it might be that categories contain items or other categories.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, it could be that A is an instance of B, or B is a broader category that includes A. But when we have \"B is C\", it means B belongs to category C, so C is a category that contains B. So if A is B and B is C, then A is also in C? Only if C is a category that contains all elements of B, but since B is an element of C, not necessarily a subset, so A may not be in C.\n\nFor example, if B is a dog, and C is animals, then if A is B, meaning A is a dog, and B is C, meaning dog is an animal, then A is an animal, so A is C. So in this case, it seems transitive if we interpret \"is\" as \"is a type of\".\n\nSimilarly, in this problem, since it's categories, likely \"A is B\" means A is a subtype of B or A is contained in B, so it should be transitive. That is, if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nOtherwise, it would be messy. So I think we can assume transitivity.\n\nSo, from x is qeylpus, and qeylpus is buntpus, so x is buntpus.\n\nSimilarly, buntpus is ruxdpus, so x is ruxdpus.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, let's trace x to babcpus.\n\nBut babcpus is under kalrpus: kalrpus is babcpus and xitppus, so kalrpus belongs to babcpus? No: \"kalrpus is babcpus\" means kalrpus belongs to babcpus, so babcpus is a category that contains kalrpus.\n\nBut we want to know if x is babcpus, meaning x belongs to babcpus.\n\nSo, we need to see if x is in the chain that leads to babcpus.\n\nFrom the other side, we have kalrpus which is babcpus, and kalrpus is from fitppus: fitppus is kalrpus, so fitppus belongs to kalrpus, so if we go up, we might find a connection to x.\n\nBut let's list all chains.\n\nFrom x: x is qeylpus -> buntpus -> ruxdpus -> fabrpus -> jijhpus -> yemtpus -> cevkpus -> lejjpus -> dudqpus -> kezfpus -> fomvpus -> gijfpus -> nozdpus -> wogxpus -> qogbpus -> kuvppus -> dixbpus -> wofhpus -> cegxpus -> jucgpus -> weyvpus -> xivqpus -> yavzpus -> qetppus -> woqxpus -> dorbpus -> pitcpus -> seddpus -> gevdpus -> ... now gevdpus is both kucqpus and zascpus? From given: \"gevdpus is kucqpus\" and \"gevdpus is zascpus\" so gevdpus belongs to kucqpus and also to zascpus.\n\nThen zascpus is felcpus.\n\nfelcpus is sosqpus and bewppus.\n\nsosqpus is rojspus? From \"sosqpus is rojspus\" given? User said: \"sosqpus is rojspus\" yes, from \"sosqpus is rojspus\" and also \"sosqpus is xalypus\" earlier? User said: \"sosqpus is xalypus\" but then later \"sosqpus is rojspus\" so sosqpus belongs to both xalypus and rojspus.\n\nThen rojspus is fozzpus.\n\nfozzpus is rimtpus.\n\nrimtpus is jarqpus and vifgpus and gakzpus.\n\njarqpus is semkpus and hivxpus.\n\nsemkpus is cihbpus and lelxpus and widjpus.\n\ncihbpus is vonvpus.\n\nvonvpus is tiwjpus.\n\ntiwjpus is zevtpus.\n\nzevtpus is tuzcpus.\n\ntuzcpus is bolypus.\n\nbolypus is fitppus.\n\nfitppus is kalrpus.\n\nkalrpus is babcpus and xitppus.\n\nSo, from gevdpus, through zascpus, felcpus, sosqpus, rojspus, fozzpus, rimtpus, jarqpus, semkpus, cihbpus, vonvpus, tiwjpus, zevtpus, tuzcpus, bolypus, fitppus, kalrpus, to babcpus.\n\nBut is gevdpus connected to x? From x, we have seddpus is gevdpus, and pitcpus is seddpus, so pitcpus is gevdpus? pitcpus is seddpus, and seddpus is gevdpus, so pitcpus is gevdpus.\n\nThen dorbpus is pitcpus, so dorbpus is gevdpus.\n\nwoqxpus is dorbpus, so woqxpus is gevdpus.\n\nqetppus is woqxpus, so qetppus is gevdpus.\n\nyavzpus is qetppus, so yavzpus is gevdpus.\n\nxivqpus is yavzpus, so xivqpus is gevdpus.\n\nweyvpus is xivqpus, so weyvpus is gevdpus.\n\njucgpus is weyvpus, so jucgpus is gevdpus.\n\ncegxpus is jucgpus, so cegxpus is gevdpus.\n\nwofhpus is cegxpus, so wofhpus is gevdpus.\n\ndixbpus is wofhpus, so dixbpus is gevdpus.\n\nkuvppus is dixbpus, so kuvppus is gevdpus.\n\nqogbpus is kuvppus, so qogbpus is gevdpus.\n\nwogxpus is qogbpus, so wogxpus is gevdpus.\n\nnozdpus is wogxpus, so nozdpus is gevdpus.\n\ngijfpus is nozdpus, so gijfpus is gevdpus.\n\nfomvpus is gijfpus, so fomvpus is gevdpus.\n\nkezfpus is fomvpus, so kezfpus is gevdpus.\n\ndudqpus is kezfpus, so dudqpus is gevdpus.\n\nlejjpus is dudqpus, so lejjpus is gevdpus.\n\ncevkpus is lejjpus, so cevkpus is gevdpus.\n\nyemtpus is cevkpus, so yemtpus is gevdpus.\n\njijhpus is yemtpus, so jijhpus is gevdpus.\n\nfabrpus is jijhpus, so fabrpus is gevdpus.\n\nruxdpus is fabrpus, so ruxdpus is gevdpus.\n\nbuntpus is ruxdpus, so buntpus is gevdpus.\n\nqeylpus is buntpus, so qeylpus is gevdpus.\n\nx is qeylpus, so x is gevdpus.\n\nTherefore, x is gevdpus.\n\nAnd since gevdpus is babcpus? No, gevdpus is connected to babcpus through the chain: gevdpus is zascpus, zascpus is felcpus, felcpus is sosqpus, sosqpus is rojspus, rojspus is fozzpus, fozzpus is rimtpus, rimtpus is jarqpus, jarqpus is semkpus, semkpus is cihbpus, cihbpus is vonvpus, vonvpus is tiwjpus, tiwjpus is zevtpus, zevtpus is tuzcpus, tuzcpus is bolypus, bolypus is fitppus, fitppus is kalrpus, kalrpus is babcpus.\n\nSo, since kalrpus is babcpus, and fitppus is kalrpus, so fitppus is babcpus, and so on, down to gevdpus is babcpus? Let's see the transitivity.\n\nIf gevdpus is zascpus, and zascpus is felcpus, so gevdpus is felcpus.\n\nfelcpus is sosqpus, so gevdpus is sosqpus.\n\nsosqpus is rojspus, so gevdpus is rojspus.\n\nrojspus is fozzpus, so gevdpus is fozzpus.\n\nfozzpus is rimtpus, so gevdpus is rimtpus.\n\nrimtpus is jarqpus, so gevdpus is jarqpus.\n\njarqpus is semkpus, so gevdpus is semkpus.\n\nsemkpus is cihbpus, so gevdpus is cihbpus.\n\ncihbpus is vonvpus, so gevdpus is vonvpus.\n\nvonvpus is tiwjpus, so gevdpus is tiwjpus.\n\ntiwjpus is zevtpus, so gevdpus is zevtpus.\n\nzevtpus is tuzcpus, so gevdpus is tuzcpus.\n\ntuzcpus is bolypus, so gevdpus is bolypus.\n\nbolypus is fitppus, so gevdpus is fitppus.\n\nfitppus is kalrpus, so gevdpus is kalrpus.\n\nkalrpus is babcpus, so gevdpus is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is gevdpus, and gevdpus is babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nSo, x is babcpus.\n\nThe question is: is x is babbpus or babcpus? Since x is babcpus, it is true that x is babcpus.\n\nBut what about babbpus? babbpus is not mentioned anywhere in the given information. So, we don't know if x is babbpus or not. But the question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus\", which is true if either is true. Since x is babcpus, the OR condition is true.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babbpus or babcpus.\n\nBut let's confirm if babbpus exists. From the given, only babcpus is mentioned, not babbpus. So, for babbpus, it is unknown, but since babcpus is true, the OR is true.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut the question is: \"Is it true or false or unknown: x is babbpus or babcpus?\"\n\nSince x is babcpus, it is true.\n\nSo, final answer is true.",
  "thinking_text": "First, I need to determine if x is either babbpus or babcpus. The given information tells me that x is qeylpus. So, x belongs to qeylpus.\n\nNow, from the information, qeylpus is buntpus.

But I need babcpus.\n\nbabcp us is under kalrpus. kalrpus is part of fitppus, which is part of bolypus, and so on. But where is x in relation to this?\n\nx is from the other side: x -> qeylpus -> buntpus -> ruxdpus -> fabrpus -> jijhpus -> yemtpus -> cevkpus -> lejjpus -> dudqpus -> kezfpus -> fomvpus -> gijfpus -> nozdpus -> wogxpus -> qogbpus -> kuvppus -> dixbpus -> wofhpus -> cegxpus -> jucgpus -> weyvpus -> xivqpus -> yavzpus -> qetppus -> woqxpus -> dorbpus -> pitcpus -> seddpus -> gevdpus -> kucqpus -> kedbpus?

But let's see if there is a path from x to babcpus.\n\nFrom x: x is qeylpus -> buntpus -> ruxdpus -> fabrpus -> jijhpus -> yemtpus -> cevkpus -> lejjpus -> dudqpus -> kezfpus -> fomvpus -> gijfpus -> nozdpus -> wogxpus -> qogbpus -> kuvppus -> dixbpus -> wofhpus -> cegxpus -> jucgpus -> weyvpus -> xivqpus -> yavzpus -> qetppus -> woqxpus -> dorbpus -> pitcpus -> seddpus -> gevdpus -> kucqpus?

No, from above: seddpus is gevdpus, and gevdpus is zascpus, and zascpus is felcpus, etc.\n\nBut in the chain from x, we have seddpus is gevdpus, and then gevdpus is kucqpus? Let's see the given information.\n\nFrom given: seddpus is gevdpus. And gevdpus is kucqpus? I don't see that. Let's read carefully.\n\nI see: gevdpus is kucqpus. Is that stated?

Wait, in the given: \"qetppus is wopspus\" is not stated. Let's read carefully.\n\nThe given says: \"qetppus is wopspus.\"? No, from the text: \"qetppus is wopspus\" is not present. Let's see the original given information.\n\nFrom the user's message: \"qetppus is wopspus.\" is not there. I think I misread.\n\nUser said: \"qetppus is wopspus.\"? Let's copy the given information:\n\n\"semkpus is cihbpus and lelxpus and widjpus. lejjpus is dudqpus. x is qeylpus. vonvpus is tiwjpus. nozdpus is wogxpus and qihypus and nujcpus and qikkpus. qeylpus is buntpus. yemtpus is cevkpus. qogbpus is kuvppus and moxppus. woqxpus is dorbpus. sosqpus is xalypus. dudqpus is kezfpus and viyxpus. fabrpus is jijhpus. jijhpus is yemtpus. xivqpus is zebtpus. pitcpus is seddpus. kezfpus is fomvpus. kucqpus is kedbpus. tiwjpus is zevtpus. rimtpus is jarqpus and vifgpus and gakzpus. dorbpus is pitcpus. seddpus is gevdpus. jarqpus is semkpus and hivxpus. ruxdpus is fabrpus. gijfpus is nozdpus. wogxpus is qogbpus. qetppus is wopspus. wofhpus is cegxpus. bolypus is fitppus. buntpus is ruxdpus and vaqxpus. jucgpus is weyvpus. xivqpus is yavzpus. yavzpus is qetppus. fozzpus is rimtpus. zebtpus is miwfpus and ruzspus. zevtpus is tuzcpus. kuvppus is dixbpus and xibfpus. qetppus is woqxpus. weyvpus is xivqpus and loswpus. rojspus is fozzpus. fitppus is kalrpus. gevdpus is kucqpus. cegxpus is jucgpus and kulvpus. cevkpus is lejjpus and buwgpus. sosqpus is rojspus. felcpus is sosqpus and bewppus. gevdpus is zascpus. miwfpus is kowdpus and povnpus. tuzcpus is bolypus. kalrpus is babcpus and xitppus. fomvpus is gijfpus and neldpus. dixbpus is wofhpus. zascpus is felcpus. cihbpus is vonvpus. kowdpus is pikppus and fasvpus.\"\n\nAh, here it is: \"qetppus is wopspus\" is not stated; instead, from the text: \"qetppus is woqxpus\" because later it says \"qetppus is woqxpus\" explicitly? Let's see: in the list, after \"yavzpus is qetppus\" and then \"fozzpus is rimtpus\" etc., but then later: \"qetppus is woqxpus\" is stated? In the user's message, it says: \"weyvpus is xivqpus and loswpus. rojspus is fozzpus. fitppus is kalrpus. gevdpus is kucqpus. cegxpus is jucgpus and kulvpus. cevkpus is lejjpus and buwgpus. sosqpus is rojspus. felcpus is sosqpus and bewppus. gevdpus is zascpus. miwfpus is kowdpus and povnpus. tuzcpus is bolypus. kalrpus is babcpus and xitppus. fomvpus is gijfpus and neldpus. dixbpus is wofhpus. zascpus is felcpus. cihbpus is vonvpus. kowdpus is pikppus and fasvpus.\"\n\nBut where is \"qetppus is woqxpus\"? Earlier in the list, I see \"woqxpus is dorbpus\" and then later \"yavzpus is qetppus\" and then after that, in the flow, but not \"qetppus is woqxpus\" explicitly? Let's read the user's message carefully.\n\nUser said: \"yavzpus is qetppus. fozzpus is rimtpus. zebtpus is miwfpus and ruzspus. zevtpus is tuzcpus. kuvppus is dixbpus and xibfpus. qetppus is woqxpus. weyvpus is xivqpus and loswpus. rojspus is fozzpus. ...\"\n\nYes! Here it is: \"qetppus is woqxpus.\" So, qetppus is woqxpus.\n\nSo, from yavzpus is qetppus, and qetppus is woqxpus, so yavzpus is woqxpus, etc.\n\nNow, back to the chain.\n\nx is qeylpus.\n\nqeylpus is buntpus.\n\nbuntpus is ruxdpus and vaqxpus.

User said: \"xivqpus is yavzpus\" yes, from \"xivqpus is yavzpus\" and also \"xivqpus is zebtpus\" earlier? Let's see: \"xivqpus is zebtpus\" is given, but then \"xivqpus is yavzpus\" is also given? User said: \"jucgpus is weyvpus. xivqpus is yavzpus. yavzpus is qetppus.\" So xivqpus is yavzpus.\n\nBut earlier, \"xivqpus is zebtpus\" is also given? User said: \"xivqpus is zebtpus\" before? Let's see: in the list, after \"jijhpus is yemtpus\" there is \"xivqpus is zebtpus\" and then \"pitcpus is seddpus\" etc. So xivqpus is both zebtpus and yavzpus? That might be possible if zebtpus and yavzpus are related, but from later, yavzpus is qetppus, and zebtpus is miwfpus and ruzspus, so they are different.\n\nBut in the \"is\" relation, it means xivqpus belongs to zebtpus and also belongs to yavzpus? So it can belong to multiple categories.\n\nSimilarly, from weyvpus is xivqpus and loswpus, so weyvpus belongs to xivqpus, meaning xivqpus is a category containing weyvpus? Let's clarify the meaning.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', so if A is B, then A is a member of B, so B is a category that contains A.\n\nSo, if we have \"xivqpus is zebtpus\" and \"xivqpus is yavzpus\", that means xivqpus belongs to both zebtpus and yavzpus, so zebtpus and yavzpus are categories that contain xivqpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"weyvpus is xivqpus and loswpus\" means weyvpus belongs to xivqpus and also to loswpus, so xivqpus contains weyvpus.\n\nSo, from weyvpus is xivqpus, and xivqpus is yavzpus, so weyvpus is also yavzpus? Since weyvpus belongs to xivqpus, and xivqpus belongs to yavzpus, then weyvpus belongs to yavzpus? But the relation is transitive? Not necessarily directly, but if A belongs to B and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C? In set theory, if B is a subset of C, then A in B implies A in C. But here, \"A is B\" means A is an element of B, so B is a set, and A is in B. But if B is in C, meaning B is an element of C, then A may not be in C unless C is a set of sets or something. But in this context, since it's categories, it might be that categories contain items or other categories.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, it could be that A is an instance of B, or B is a broader category that includes A. But when we have \"B is C\", it means B belongs to category C, so C is a category that contains B. So if A is B and B is C, then A is also in C? Only if C is a category that contains all elements of B, but since B is an element of C, not necessarily a subset, so A may not be in C.\n\nFor example, if B is a dog, and C is animals, then if A is B, meaning A is a dog, and B is C, meaning dog is an animal, then A is an animal, so A is C. So in this case, it seems transitive if we interpret \"is\" as \"is a type of\".\n\nSimilarly, in this problem, since it's categories, likely \"A is B\" means A is a subtype of B or A is contained in B, so it should be transitive. That is, if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nOtherwise, it would be messy. So I think we can assume transitivity.\n\nSo, from x is qeylpus, and qeylpus is buntpus, so x is buntpus.\n\nSimilarly, buntpus is ruxdpus, so x is ruxdpus.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, let's trace x to babcpus.\n\nBut babcpus is under kalrpus: kalrpus is babcpus and xitppus, so kalrpus belongs to babcpus? No: \"kalrpus is babcpus\" means kalrpus belongs to babcpus, so babcpus is a category that contains kalrpus.\n\nBut we want to know if x is babcpus, meaning x belongs to babcpus.\n\nSo, we need to see if x is in the chain that leads to babcpus.\n\nFrom the other side, we have kalrpus which is babcpus, and kalrpus is from fitppus: fitppus is kalrpus, so fitppus belongs to kalrpus, so if we go up, we might find a connection to x.\n\nBut let's list all chains.\n\nFrom x: x is qeylpus -> buntpus -> ruxdpus -> fabrpus -> jijhpus -> yemtpus -> cevkpus -> lejjpus -> dudqpus -> kezfpus -> fomvpus -> gijfpus -> nozdpus -> wogxpus -> qogbpus -> kuvppus -> dixbpus -> wofhpus -> cegxpus -> jucgpus -> weyvpus -> xivqpus -> yavzpus -> qetppus -> woqxpus -> dorbpus -> pitcpus -> seddpus -> gevdpus -> ... now gevdpus is both kucqpus and zascpus? From given: \"gevdpus is kucqpus\" and \"gevdpus is zascpus\" so gevdpus belongs to kucqpus and also to zascpus.\n\nThen zascpus is felcpus.\n\nfelcpus is sosqpus and bewppus.\n\nsosqpus is rojspus? From \"sosqpus is rojspus\" given? User said: \"sosqpus is rojspus\" yes, from \"sosqpus is rojspus\" and also \"sosqpus is xalypus\" earlier? User said: \"sosqpus is xalypus\" but then later \"sosqpus is rojspus\" so sosqpus belongs to both xalypus and rojspus.\n\nThen rojspus is fozzpus.\n\nfozzpus is rimtpus.\n\nrimtpus is jarqpus and vifgpus and gakzpus.\n\njarqpus is semkpus and hivxpus.\n\nsemkpus is cihbpus and lelxpus and widjpus.\n\ncihbpus is vonvpus.\n\nvonvpus is tiwjpus.\n\ntiwjpus is zevtpus.\n\nzevtpus is tuzcpus.\n\ntuzcpus is bolypus.\n\nbolypus is fitppus.\n\nfitppus is kalrpus.\n\nkalrpus is babcpus and xitppus.\n\nSo, from gevdpus, through zascpus, felcpus, sosqpus, rojspus, fozzpus, rimtpus, jarqpus, semkpus, cihbpus, vonvpus, tiwjpus, zevtpus, tuzcpus, bolypus, fitppus, kalrpus, to babcpus.\n\nBut is gevdpus connected to x? From x, we have seddpus is gevdpus, and pitcpus is seddpus, so pitcpus is gevdpus? pitcpus is seddpus, and seddpus is gevdpus, so pitcpus is gevdpus.\n\nThen dorbpus is pitcpus, so dorbpus is gevdpus.\n\nwoqxpus is dorbpus, so woqxpus is gevdpus.\n\nqetppus is woqxpus, so qetppus is gevdpus.\n\nyavzpus is qetppus, so yavzpus is gevdpus.\n\nxivqpus is yavzpus, so xivqpus is gevdpus.\n\nweyvpus is xivqpus, so weyvpus is gevdpus.\n\njucgpus is weyvpus, so jucgpus is gevdpus.\n\ncegxpus is jucgpus, so cegxpus is gevdpus.\n\nwofhpus is cegxpus, so wofhpus is gevdpus.\n\ndixbpus is wofhpus, so dixbpus is gevdpus.\n\nkuvppus is dixbpus, so kuvppus is gevdpus.\n\nqogbpus is kuvppus, so qogbpus is gevdpus.\n\nwogxpus is qogbpus, so wogxpus is gevdpus.\n\nnozdpus is wogxpus, so nozdpus is gevdpus.\n\ngijfpus is nozdpus, so gijfpus is gevdpus.\n\nfomvpus is gijfpus, so fomvpus is gevdpus.\n\nkezfpus is fomvpus, so kezfpus is gevdpus.\n\ndudqpus is kezfpus, so dudqpus is gevdpus.\n\nlejjpus is dudqpus, so lejjpus is gevdpus.\n\ncevkpus is lejjpus, so cevkpus is gevdpus.\n\nyemtpus is cevkpus, so yemtpus is gevdpus.\n\njijhpus is yemtpus, so jijhpus is gevdpus.\n\nfabrpus is jijhpus, so fabrpus is gevdpus.\n\nruxdpus is fabrpus, so ruxdpus is gevdpus.\n\nbuntpus is ruxdpus, so buntpus is gevdpus.\n\nqeylpus is buntpus, so qeylpus is gevdpus.\n\nx is qeylpus, so x is gevdpus.\n\nTherefore, x is gevdpus.\n\nAnd since gevdpus is babcpus? No, gevdpus is connected to babcpus through the chain: gevdpus is zascpus, zascpus is felcpus, felcpus is sosqpus, sosqpus is rojspus, rojspus is fozzpus, fozzpus is rimtpus, rimtpus is jarqpus, jarqpus is semkpus, semkpus is cihbpus, cihbpus is vonvpus, vonvpus is tiwjpus, tiwjpus is zevtpus, zevtpus is tuzcpus, tuzcpus is bolypus, bolypus is fitppus, fitppus is kalrpus, kalrpus is babcpus.\n\nSo, since kalrpus is babcpus, and fitppus is kalrpus, so fitppus is babcpus, and so on, down to gevdpus is babcpus? Let's see the transitivity.\n\nIf gevdpus is zascpus, and zascpus is felcpus, so gevdpus is felcpus.\n\nfelcpus is sosqpus, so gevdpus is sosqpus.\n\nsosqpus is rojspus, so gevdpus is rojspus.\n\nrojspus is fozzpus, so gevdpus is fozzpus.\n\nfozzpus is rimtpus, so gevdpus is rimtpus.\n\nrimtpus is jarqpus, so gevdpus is jarqpus.\n\njarqpus is semkpus, so gevdpus is semkpus.\n\nsemkpus is cihbpus, so gevdpus is cihbpus.\n\ncihbpus is vonvpus, so gevdpus is vonvpus.\n\nvonvpus is tiwjpus, so gevdpus is tiwjpus.\n\ntiwjpus is zevtpus, so gevdpus is zevtpus.\n\nzevtpus is tuzcpus, so gevdpus is tuzcpus.\n\ntuzcpus is bolypus, so gevdpus is bolypus.\n\nbolypus is fitppus, so gevdpus is fitppus.\n\nfitppus is kalrpus, so gevdpus is kalrpus.\n\nkalrpus is babcpus, so gevdpus is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is gevdpus, and gevdpus is babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nSo, x is babcpus.\n\nThe question is: is x is babbpus or babcpus? Since x is babcpus, it is true that x is babcpus.\n\nBut what about babbpus? babbpus is not mentioned anywhere in the given information. So, we don't know if x is babbpus or not. But the question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus\", which is true if either is true. Since x is babcpus, the OR condition is true.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babbpus or babcpus.\n\nBut let's confirm if babbpus exists. From the given, only babcpus is mentioned, not babbpus. So, for babbpus, it is unknown, but since babcpus is true, the OR is true.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut the question is: \"Is it true or false or unknown: x is babbpus or babcpus?\"\n\nSince x is babcpus, it is true.\n\nSo, final answer is true.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

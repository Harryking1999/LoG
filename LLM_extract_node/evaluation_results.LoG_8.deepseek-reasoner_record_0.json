  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is either babbpus, babcpus, or babppus. The given information states that x is fabfpus. So, I need to trace what fabfpus is and see if it leads to any of these categories.\n\nFrom the information: fabfpus is soxspus and hoqcpus. So, x is fabfpus, which means x is soxspus and hoqcpus. But I need to see if x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus.\n\nNow, looking at the categories, babbpus is mentioned in gowypus: gowypus is babbpus and ratspus and vulmpus. Also, puqrpus is gowypus, and cupgpus is puqrpus and xosmpus, but I need to see if x is connected to gowypus or babbpus.\n\nSince x is fabfpus, and fabfpus is soxspus and hoqcpus, I should explore soxspus and hoqcpus.\n\nsoxspus is jedjpus and kohtpus. jedjpus is vasfpus. vasfpus is dumcpus. dumcpus is nedlpus. nedlpus is puclpus and judypus. puclpus is zuqrpus. zuqrpus is dazkpus and pomdpus. dazkpus is ruvvpus and noddpus. ruvvpus is yumypus and titppus. yumypus is vovkpus and caqzpus. vovkpus is xugrpus. But this seems long, and I'm not sure if it leads to babbpus.\n\nI should look for a direct connection to babbpus. babbpus is part of gowypus, so I need to see if x is connected to gowypus.\n\ngowypus is babbpus and ratspus and vulmpus. And puqrpus is gowypus. cupgpus is puqrpus and xosmpus. ridxpus is cupgpus and zehnpus. But where is x in this?\n\nx is fabfpus, which is soxspus and hoqcpus. I need to see if soxspus or hoqcpus connects to gowypus.\n\nFrom soxspus: soxspus is jedjpus and kohtpus. jedjpus is vasfpus. vasfpus is dumcpus. dumcpus is sivnpus? Wait, no: vasfpus is dumcpus, and dumcpus is nedlpus, but also, from another part, dumcpus is sivnpus? Let's see.\n\nThere is a statement: dumcpus is sivnpus. But from vasfpus is dumcpus, and dumcpus is nedlpus, so perhaps dumcpus has multiple categories? In this context, \"is\" might mean belongs to multiple categories, so dumcpus can be both nedlpus and sivnpus.\n\nSimilarly, from the information: dumcpus is nedlpus. and also, dumcpus is sivnpus? Wait, let's find where dumcpus is sivnpus.\n\nFrom the given: vasfpus is dumcpus. and then later: dumcpus is sivnpus. Yes, it says \"dumcpus is sivnpus.\" So dumcpus belongs to sivnpus.\n\nBut for now, from soxspus -> jedjpus -> vasfpus -> dumcpus -> nedlpus -> puclpus -> zuqrpus -> dazkpus -> ruvvpus -> yumypus -> vovkpus -> xugrpus, etc. This doesn't seem to lead to babbpus.\n\nNow, what about hoqcpus? fabfpus is hoqcpus, but I don't see any information about hoqcpus in the given list. I see hoqgpus, but not hoqcpus. Let's check the given information carefully.\n\nThe given information has: fernpus is hoqgpus and wufmpus. and hoqgpus is zexvpus and vayzpus. But no hoqcpus. So perhaps hoqcpus is not defined? But fabfpus is soxspus and hoqcpus, so hoqcpus must be a category, but it's not mentioned anywhere else. That might be a problem.\n\nMaybe I missed it. Let's read the entire given information again.\n\n**Given Information**: tonwpus is wurjpus. sivnpus is danzpus and muqypus. fernpus is hoqgpus and wufmpus. wiwxpus is naszpus. wilppus is viphpus and xodbpus and todkpus. jimrpus is xojppus. vovxpus is navdpus. navdpus is muknpus. soxspus is jedjpus and kohtpus. vasfpus is dumcpus. jonrpus is wakvpus. jemqpus is pipnpus and rubqpus. zegvpus is fedwpus. votppus is wiwxpus. jujjpus is zegvpus and xivqpus. tindpus is dulspus. boygpus is gaxrpus. tecqpus is manvpus. vovkpus is xugrpus. popbpus is vovxpus. jagfpus is sarwpus. ruvvpus is yumypus and titppus. cupgpus is puqrpus and xosmpus. vewgpus is diqvpus. yodjpus is depbpus. leytpus is jagfpus. dumcpus is nedlpus. zuqrpus is dazkpus and pomdpus. ridxpus is cupgpus and zehnpus. x is fabfpus. fedwpus is wacdpus and zikdpus and kichpus. dulspus is dutbpus. viphpus is yicnpus. manvpus is huhnpus. naszpus is rabhpus. nedlpus is puclpus and judypus. wacdpus is tindpus. rumxpus is quvrpus and xofxpus. puclpus is zuqrpus. fabfpus is soxspus and hoqcpus. rabhpus is jumjpus. loyypus is rumxpus and goylpus. muknpus is leytpus. yicnpus is tecqpus. dedfpus is votppus. gowypus is babbpus and ratspus and vulmpus. pipnpus is fernpus. labxpus is popbpus and zockpus. vovkpus is yizypus. zexvpus is ridxpus and yaxrpus. zabqpus is xudcpus and diwmpus. quvrpus is jemqpus. hoqgpus is zexvpus and vayzpus. puqrpus is gowypus. wurjpus is wilppus. fapcpus is jonrpus and yobspus and rojppus and makgpus. sarwpus is jimrpus. gaxrpus is mixnpus. govkpus is fapcpus. guvkpus is vewgpus. dutbpus is qodbpus and cozxpus. xudcpus is vohgpus. talppus is guvkpus. vewgpus is tonwpus. dumcpus is sivnpus. jumjpus is loyypus. dazkpus is ruvvpus and noddpus. mixnpus is labxpus. vohgpus is dedfpus. wakvpus is yodjpus and gukvpus. yizypus is boygpus and catnpus. huhnpus is zabqpus. xojppus is jujjpus. jedjpus is vasfpus. qodbpus is govkpus. vewgpus is hawwpus. depbpus is talppus and gazxpus. yumypus is vovkpus and caqzpus.\n\nI don't see hoqcpus anywhere else. So hoqcpus is only mentioned as part of fabfpus, but no further information. So for hoqcpus, we don't know what it is, so it might be unknown.\n\nBut the question is about x being babbpus or babcpus or babppus. Since x is fabfpus, which is soxspus and hoqcpus, so x is soxspus, and we can trace soxspus, but also x is hoqcpus, which is unknown.\n\nBut we need to see if x is babbpus, etc. Since hoqcpus is unknown, it might be that x is not necessarily babbpus, but let's see if soxspus leads to babbpus.\n\nLet's trace soxspus: soxspus is jedjpus and kohtpus.\n\njedjpus is vasfpus.\n\nvasfpus is dumcpus.\n\ndumcpus is nedlpus and also dumcpus is sivnpus. But let's follow nedlpus.\n\nnedlpus is puclpus and judypus.\n\npuclpus is zuqrpus.\n\nzuqrpus is dazkpus and pomdpus.\n\ndazkpus is ruvvpus and noddpus.\n\nruvvpus is yumypus and titppus.\n\nyumypus is vovkpus and caqzpus.\n\nvovkpus is xugrpus and also vovkpus is yizypus? From above: vovkpus is xugrpus, and later vovkpus is yizypus? Let's see: \"vovkpus is xugrpus.\" and then \"vovkpus is yizypus.\"? No, from the list: \"vovkpus is xugrpus.\" and then later \"yizypus is boygpus and catnpus.\" but also from \"yumypus is vovkpus and caqzpus.\" so yumypus includes vovkpus.\n\nBut also, from another part: \"vovkpus is yizypus.\"? I think I misread. Let's check: in the list, after \"vovkpus is xugrpus.\" there is \"popbpus is vovxpus.\" etc. Then later, \"labxpus is popbpus and zockpus. vovkpus is yizypus.\" Yes! It says \"vovkpus is yizypus.\" So vovkpus is also yizypus.\n\nyizypus is boygpus and catnpus.\n\nboygpus is gaxrpus.\n\ngaxrpus is mixnpus.\n\nmixnpus is labxpus.\n\nlabxpus is popbpus and zockpus.\n\npopbpus is vovxpus.\n\nvovxpus is navdpus.\n\nnavdpus is muknpus.\n\nmuknpus is leytpus.\n\nleytpus is jagfpus.\n\njagfpus is sarwpus.\n\nsarwpus is jimrpus.\n\njimrpus is xojppus.\n\nxojppus is jujjpus.\n\njujjpus is zegvpus and xivqpus.\n\nzegvpus is fedwpus.\n\nfedwpus is wacdpus and zikdpus and kichpus.\n\nwacdpus is tindpus.\n\ntindpus is dulspus.\n\ndulspus is dutbpus.\n\ndutbpus is qodbpus and cozxpus.\n\nqodbpus is govkpus.\n\ngovkpus is fapcpus.\n\nfapcpus is jonrpus and yobspus and rojppus and makgpus.\n\njonrpus is wakvpus.\n\nwakvpus is yodjpus and gukvpus.\n\nyodjpus is depbpus.\n\ndepbpus is talppus and gazxpus.\n\ntalppus is guvkpus.\n\nguvkpus is vewgpus.\n\nvewgpus is diqvpus and also vewgpus is tonwpus and vewgpus is hawwpus? From \"vewgpus is diqvpus\" and \"vewgpus is tonwpus\" and \"vewgpus is hawwpus\" so multiple.\n\nvewgpus is tonwpus.\n\ntonwpus is wurjpus.\n\nwurjpus is wilppus.\n\nwilppus is viphpus and xodbpus and todkpus.\n\nviphpus is yicnpus.\n\nyicnpus is tecqpus.\n\ntecqpus is manvpus.\n\nmanvpus is huhnpus.\n\nhuhnpus is zabqpus.\n\nzabqpus is xudcpus and diwmpus.\n\nxudcpus is vohgpus.\n\nvohgpus is dedfpus.\n\ndedfpus is votppus.\n\nvotppus is wiwxpus.\n\nwiwxpus is naszpus.\n\nnaszpus is rabhpus.\n\nrabhpus is jumjpus.\n\njumjpus is loyypus.\n\nloyypus is rumxpus and goylpus.\n\nrumxpus is quvrpus and xofxpus.\n\nquvrpus is jemqpus.\n\njemqpus is pipnpus and rubqpus.\n\npipnpus is fernpus.\n\nfernpus is hoqgpus and wufmpus.\n\nhoqgpus is zexvpus and vayzpus.\n\nzexvpus is ridxpus and yaxrpus.\n\nridxpus is cupgpus and zehnpus.\n\ncupgpus is puqrpus and xosmpus.\n\npuqrpus is gowypus.\n\ngowypus is babbpus and ratspus and vulmpus.\n\nFinally! We have gowypus which contains babbpus.\n\nSo from soxspus, through a long chain, we eventually reach gowypus which has babbpus.\n\nBut does this mean that soxspus is babbpus? Not directly. Since soxspus is jedjpus and kohtpus, and jedjpus leads to vasfpus, etc., and eventually to gowypus, but gowypus is a category that includes babbpus, but for soxspus to be babbpus, it must be that soxspus is part of gowypus, but from the chain, we have soxspus -> jedjpus -> vasfpus -> dumcpus -> ... -> puqrpus -> gowypus -> babbpus.\n\nBut note that \"is\" means belongs to category, so if A is B, and B is C, then A is C? In this context, it seems that the relation is transitive? Let's see the note: \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". So if A belongs to B, and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C? That seems reasonable for containment or category membership.\n\nFor example, from the chain, vasfpus is dumcpus, and dumcpus is nedlpus, so vasfpus is nedlpus? Similarly, from above, we have multiple such chains.\n\nIn fact, from the given, there is direct statement: dumcpus is sivnpus, and also dumcpus is nedlpus, so dumcpus belongs to both.\n\nSo yes, the relation should be transitive. So if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nTherefore, from soxspus, we can trace to gowypus, and since gowypus is babbpus (meaning gowypus contains babbpus? No, let's read: \"gowypus is babbpus and ratspus and vulmpus\" so gowypus belongs to babbpus? Or does it mean that gowypus consists of babbpus, etc.?\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". So when we say \"gowypus is babbpus\", it means gowypus belongs to category babbpus? Or does it mean that babbpus is a part of gowypus? The phrasing is ambiguous.\n\nLet's look at the note: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\"\n\nSo, if we say \"gowypus is babbpus\", it means gowypus belongs to category babbpus, so babbpus is a category, and gowypus is a member of that category. Similarly, if we say \"puqrpus is gowypus\", it means puqrpus belongs to category gowypus.\n\nBut in the statement \"gowypus is babbpus and ratspus and vulmpus\", this seems to imply that gowypus belongs to multiple categories: babbpus, ratspus, and vulmpus. So babbpus is a category, and gowypus is in that category.\n\nThen, if we have puqrpus is gowypus, then puqrpus is in gowypus category, and since gowypus is in babbpus category, then puqrpus is in babbpus category? Yes, by transitivity.\n\nSimilarly, from soxspus, we trace to puqrpus, so soxspus should be in babbpus category.\n\nBut we need to see if x is babbpus. x is fabfpus, and fabfpus is soxspus and hoqcpus. So since fabfpus is soxspus, and soxspus is in babbpus category, then fabfpus is in babbpus category, so x is in babbpus category? That means x is babbpus? But let's confirm.\n\nThe question is: \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" So if x is in the category babbpus, then it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nBut we need to ensure that the chain is correct.\n\nFrom soxspus to babbpus:\n\nsoxspus is jedjpus and kohtpus → so soxspus belongs to jedjpus category? No: \"soxspus is jedjpus\" means soxspus belongs to category jedjpus? Or does it mean that jedjpus is a category and soxspus is contained in it?\n\nFrom the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so B is the category. So when we say \"soxspus is jedjpus\", it means soxspus belongs to category jedjpus, so jedjpus is the category.\n\nSimilarly, \"jedjpus is vasfpus\" means jedjpus belongs to category vasfpus.\n\nSo for transitivity: if A is B and B is C, then A is C, meaning A belongs to category C.\n\nSo from soxspus is jedjpus, and jedjpus is vasfpus, so soxspus is vasfpus.\n\nThen vasfpus is dumcpus, so soxspus is dumcpus.\n\ndumcpus is nedlpus, so soxspus is nedlpus.\n\nnedlpus is puclpus and judypus, so nedlpus belongs to puclpus category? Since \"nedlpus is puclpus\" means nedlpus belongs to category puclpus.\n\nSo soxspus is nedlpus, and nedlpus is puclpus, so soxspus is puclpus.\n\nThen puclpus is zuqrpus, so soxspus is zuqrpus.\n\nzuqrpus is dazkpus and pomdpus, so zuqrpus belongs to dazkpus category, so soxspus is dazkpus.\n\ndazkpus is ruvvpus and noddpus, so dazkpus belongs to ruvvpus category, so soxspus is ruvvpus.\n\nruvvpus is yumypus and titppus, so ruvvpus belongs to yumypus category, so soxspus is yumypus.\n\nyumypus is vovkpus and caqzpus, so yumypus belongs to vovkpus category, so soxspus is vovkpus.\n\nBut from earlier, vovkpus is yizypus? From the list: \"vovkpus is yizypus.\" so vovkpus belongs to yizypus category, so soxspus is yizypus.\n\nyizypus is boygpus and catnpus, so yizypus belongs to boygpus category, so soxspus is boygpus.\n\nboygpus is gaxrpus, so soxspus is gaxrpus.\n\ngaxrpus is mixnpus, so soxspus is mixnpus.\n\nmixnpus is labxpus, so soxspus is labxpus.\n\nlabxpus is popbpus and zockpus, so labxpus belongs to popbpus category, so soxspus is popbpus.\n\npopbpus is vovxpus, so soxspus is vovxpus.\n\nvovxpus is navdpus, so soxspus is navdpus.\n\nnavdpus is muknpus, so soxspus is muknpus.\n\nmuknpus is leytpus, so soxspus is leytpus.\n\nleytpus is jagfpus, so soxspus is jagfpus.\n\njagfpus is sarwpus, so soxspus is sarwpus.\n\nsarwpus is jimrpus, so soxspus is jimrpus.\n\njimrpus is xojppus, so soxspus is xojppus.\n\nxojppus is jujjpus, so soxspus is jujjpus.\n\njujjpus is zegvpus and xivqpus, so jujjpus belongs to zegvpus category, so soxspus is zegvpus.\n\nzegvpus is fedwpus, so soxspus is fedwpus.\n\nfedwpus is wacdpus and zikdpus and kichpus, so fedwpus belongs to wacdpus category, so soxspus is wacdpus.\n\nwacdpus is tindpus, so soxspus is tindpus.\n\ntindpus is dulspus, so soxspus is dulspus.\n\ndulspus is dutbpus, so soxspus is dutbpus.\n\ndutbpus is qodbpus and cozxpus, so dutbpus belongs to qodbpus category, so soxspus is qodbpus.\n\nqodbpus is govkpus, so soxspus is govkpus.\n\ngovkpus is fapcpus, so soxspus is fapcpus.\n\nfapcpus is jonrpus and yobspus and rojppus and makgpus, so fapcpus belongs to jonrpus category, so soxspus is jonrpus.\n\njonrpus is wakvpus, so soxspus is wakvpus.\n\nwakvpus is yodjpus and gukvpus, so wakvpus belongs to yodjpus category, so soxspus is yodjpus.\n\nyodjpus is depbpus, so soxspus is depbpus.\n\ndepbpus is talppus and gazxpus, so depbpus belongs to talppus category, so soxspus is talppus.\n\ntalppus is guvkpus, so soxspus is guvkpus.\n\nguvkpus is vewgpus, so soxspus is vewgpus.\n\nvewgpus is tonwpus, so soxspus is tonwpus.\n\ntonwpus is wurjpus, so soxspus is wurjpus.\n\nwurjpus is wilppus, so soxspus is wilppus.\n\nwilppus is viphpus and xodbpus and todkpus, so wilppus belongs to viphpus category, so soxspus is viphpus.\n\nviphpus is yicnpus, so soxspus is yicnpus.\n\nyicnpus is tecqpus, so soxspus is tecqpus.\n\ntecqpus is manvpus, so soxspus is manvpus.\n\nmanvpus is huhnpus, so soxspus is huhnpus.\n\nhuhnpus is zabqpus, so soxspus is zabqpus.\n\nzabqpus is xudcpus and diwmpus, so zabqpus belongs to xudcpus category, so soxspus is xudcpus.\n\nxudcpus is vohgpus, so soxspus is vohgpus.\n\nvohgpus is dedfpus, so soxspus is dedfpus.\n\ndedfpus is votppus, so soxspus is votppus.\n\nvotppus is wiwxpus, so soxspus is wiwxpus.\n\nwiwxpus is naszpus, so soxspus is naszpus.\n\nnaszpus is rabhpus, so soxspus is rabhpus.\n\nrabhpus is jumjpus, so soxspus is jumjpus.\n\njumjpus is loyypus, so soxspus is loyypus.\n\nloyypus is rumxpus and goylpus, so loyypus belongs to rumxpus category, so soxspus is rumxpus.\n\nrumxpus is quvrpus and xofxpus, so rumxpus belongs to quvrpus category, so soxspus is quvrpus.\n\nquvrpus is jemqpus, so soxspus is jemqpus.\n\njemqpus is pipnpus and rubqpus, so jemqpus belongs to pipnpus category, so soxspus is pipnpus.\n\npipnpus is fernpus, so soxspus is fernpus.\n\nfernpus is hoqgpus and wufmpus, so fernpus belongs to hoqgpus category, so soxspus is hoqgpus.\n\nhoqgpus is zexvpus and vayzpus, so hoqgpus belongs to zexvpus category, so soxspus is zexvpus.\n\nzexvpus is ridxpus and yaxrpus, so zexvpus belongs to ridxpus category, so soxspus is ridxpus.\n\nridxpus is cupgpus and zehnpus, so ridxpus belongs to cupgpus category, so soxspus is cupgpus.\n\ncupgpus is puqrpus and xosmpus, so cupgpus belongs to puqrpus category, so soxspus is puqrpus.\n\npuqrpus is gowypus, so soxspus is gowypus.\n\ngowypus is babbpus and ratspus and vulmpus, so gowypus belongs to babbpus category, so soxspus is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, soxspus is babbpus.\n\nSince x is fabfpus and fabfpus is soxspus, so x is soxspus, and since soxspus is babbpus, then x is babbpus.\n\nSo it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" Since we have x is babbpus, it is true for babbpus.\n\nWe don't have information about babcpus or babppus, but since the question is \"or\", if one is true, it is true.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut we also have that fabfpus is hoqcpus, which is unknown, but since fabfpus is soxspus, and soxspus is babbpus, so regardless of hoqcpus, x is babbpus.\n\nSo for the question, it is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is true.",

And puqrpus is gowypus. cupgpus is puqrpus and xosmpus. ridxpus is cupgpus and zehnpus. But where is x in this?\n\nx is fabfpus, which is soxspus and hoqcpus. I need to see if soxspus or hoqcpus connects to gowypus.\n\nFrom soxspus: soxspus is jedjpus and kohtpus. jedjpus is vasfpus. vasfpus is dumcpus. dumcpus is sivnpus? Wait, no: vasfpus is dumcpus, and dumcpus is nedlpus, but also, from another part, dumcpus is sivnpus? Let's see.\n\nThere is a statement: dumcpus is sivnpus. But from vasfpus is dumcpus, and dumcpus is nedlpus, so perhaps dumcpus has multiple categories? In this context, \"is\" might mean belongs to multiple categories, so dumcpus can be both nedlpus and sivnpus.\n\nSimilarly, from the information: dumcpus is nedlpus. and also, dumcpus is sivnpus? Wait, let's find where dumcpus is sivnpus.\n\nFrom the given: vasfpus is dumcpus. and then later: dumcpus is sivnpus. Yes, it says \"dumcpus is sivnpus.\" So dumcpus belongs to sivnpus.\n\nBut for now, from soxspus -> jedjpus -> vasfpus -> dumcpus -> nedlpus -> puclpus -> zuqrpus -> dazkpus -> ruvvpus -> yumypus -> vovkpus -> xugrpus, etc. This doesn't seem to lead to babbpus.\n\nNow, what about hoqcpus? fabfpus is hoqcpus, but I don't see any information about hoqcpus in the given list. I see hoqgpus, but not hoqcpus. Let's check the given information carefully.\n\nThe given information has: fernpus is hoqgpus and wufmpus. and hoqgpus is zexvpus and vayzpus. But no hoqcpus. So perhaps hoqcpus is not defined? But fabfpus is soxspus and hoqcpus, so hoqcpus must be a category, but it's not mentioned anywhere else. That might be a problem.\n\nMaybe I missed it. Let's read the entire given information again.\n\n**Given Information**: tonwpus is wurjpus. sivnpus is danzpus and muqypus. fernpus is hoqgpus and wufmpus. wiwxpus is naszpus. wilppus is viphpus and xodbpus and todkpus. jimrpus is xojppus. vovxpus is navdpus. navdpus is muknpus. soxspus is jedjpus and kohtpus. vasfpus is dumcpus. jonrpus is wakvpus. jemqpus is pipnpus and rubqpus. zegvpus is fedwpus. votppus is wiwxpus. jujjpus is zegvpus and xivqpus. tindpus is dulspus. boygpus is gaxrpus. tecqpus is manvpus. vovkpus is xugrpus. popbpus is vovxpus. jagfpus is sarwpus. ruvvpus is yumypus and titppus. cupgpus is puqrpus and xosmpus. vewgpus is diqvpus. yodjpus is depbpus. leytpus is jagfpus. dumcpus is nedlpus. zuqrpus is dazkpus and pomdpus. ridxpus is cupgpus and zehnpus. x is fabfpus. fedwpus is wacdpus and zikdpus and kichpus. dulspus is dutbpus. viphpus is yicnpus. manvpus is huhnpus. naszpus is rabhpus. nedlpus is puclpus and judypus. wacdpus is tindpus. rumxpus is quvrpus and xofxpus. puclpus is zuqrpus. fabfpus is soxspus and hoqcpus. rabhpus is jumjpus. loyypus is rumxpus and goylpus. muknpus is leytpus. yicnpus is tecqpus. dedfpus is votppus. gowypus is babbpus and ratspus and vulmpus. pipnpus is fernpus. labxpus is popbpus and zockpus. vovkpus is yizypus. zexvpus is ridxpus and yaxrpus. zabqpus is xudcpus and diwmpus. quvrpus is jemqpus. hoqgpus is zexvpus and vayzpus. puqrpus is gowypus. wurjpus is wilppus. fapcpus is jonrpus and yobspus and rojppus and makgpus. sarwpus is jimrpus. gaxrpus is mixnpus. govkpus is fapcpus. guvkpus is vewgpus. dutbpus is qodbpus and cozxpus. xudcpus is vohgpus. talppus is guvkpus. vewgpus is tonwpus. dumcpus is sivnpus. jumjpus is loyypus. dazkpus is ruvvpus and noddpus. mixnpus is labxpus. vohgpus is dedfpus. wakvpus is yodjpus and gukvpus. yizypus is boygpus and catnpus. huhnpus is zabqpus. xojppus is jujjpus. jedjpus is vasfpus. qodbpus is govkpus. vewgpus is hawwpus. depbpus is talppus and gazxpus. yumypus is vovkpus and caqzpus.\n\nI don't see hoqcpus anywhere else. So hoqcpus is only mentioned as part of fabfpus, but no further information. So for hoqcpus, we don't know what it is, so it might be unknown.\n\nBut the question is about x being babbpus or babcpus or babppus. Since x is fabfpus, which is soxspus and hoqcpus, so x is soxspus, and we can trace soxspus, but also x is hoqcpus, which is unknown.\n\nBut we need to see if x is babbpus, etc. Since hoqcpus is unknown, it might be that x is not necessarily babbpus, but let's see if soxspus leads to babbpus.\n\nLet's trace soxspus: soxspus is jedjpus and kohtpus.\n\njedjpus is vasfpus.\n\nvasfpus is dumcpus.\n\ndumcpus is nedlpus and also dumcpus is sivnpus. But let's follow nedlpus.\n\nnedlpus is puclpus and judypus.\n\npuclpus is zuqrpus.\n\nzuqrpus is dazkpus and pomdpus.\n\ndazkpus is ruvvpus and noddpus.\n\nruvvpus is yumypus and titppus.\n\nyumypus is vovkpus and caqzpus.\n\nvovkpus is xugrpus and also vovkpus is yizypus? From above: vovkpus is xugrpus, and later vovkpus is yizypus? Let's see: \"vovkpus is xugrpus.\" and then \"vovkpus is yizypus.\"? No, from the list: \"vovkpus is xugrpus.\" and then later \"yizypus is boygpus and catnpus.\" but also from \"yumypus is vovkpus and caqzpus.\" so yumypus includes vovkpus.\n\nBut also, from another part: \"vovkpus is yizypus.\"? I think I misread. Let's check: in the list, after \"vovkpus is xugrpus.\" there is \"popbpus is vovxpus.\" etc. Then later, \"labxpus is popbpus and zockpus. vovkpus is yizypus.\" Yes! It says \"vovkpus is yizypus.\" So vovkpus is also yizypus.\n\nyizypus is boygpus and catnpus.\n\nboygpus is gaxrpus.\n\ngaxrpus is mixnpus.\n\nmixnpus is labxpus.\n\nlabxpus is popbpus and zockpus.\n\npopbpus is vovxpus.\n\nvovxpus is navdpus.\n\nnavdpus is muknpus.\n\nmuknpus is leytpus.\n\nleytpus is jagfpus.\n\njagfpus is sarwpus.\n\nsarwpus is jimrpus.\n\njimrpus is xojppus.\n\nxojppus is jujjpus.\n\njujjpus is zegvpus and xivqpus.\n\nzegvpus is fedwpus.\n\nfedwpus is wacdpus and zikdpus and kichpus.\n\nwacdpus is tindpus.\n\ntindpus is dulspus.\n\ndulspus is dutbpus.\n\ndutbpus is qodbpus and cozxpus.\n\nqodbpus is govkpus.\n\ngovkpus is fapcpus.\n\nfapcpus is jonrpus and yobspus and rojppus and makgpus.\n\njonrpus is wakvpus.\n\nwakvpus is yodjpus and gukvpus.\n\nyodjpus is depbpus.\n\ndepbpus is talppus and gazxpus.\n\ntalppus is guvkpus.\n\nguvkpus is vewgpus.\n\nvewgpus is diqvpus and also vewgpus is tonwpus and vewgpus is hawwpus? From \"vewgpus is diqvpus\" and \"vewgpus is tonwpus\" and \"vewgpus is hawwpus\" so multiple.\n\nvewgpus is tonwpus.\n\ntonwpus is wurjpus.\n\nwurjpus is wilppus.\n\nwilppus is viphpus and xodbpus and todkpus.\n\nviphpus is yicnpus.\n\nyicnpus is tecqpus.\n\ntecqpus is manvpus.\n\nmanvpus is huhnpus.\n\nhuhnpus is zabqpus.\n\nzabqpus is xudcpus and diwmpus.\n\nxudcpus is vohgpus.\n\nvohgpus is dedfpus.\n\ndedfpus is votppus.\n\nvotppus is wiwxpus.\n\nwiwxpus is naszpus.\n\nnaszpus is rabhpus.\n\nrabhpus is jumjpus.\n\njumjpus is loyypus.\n\nloyypus is rumxpus and goylpus.\n\nrumxpus is quvrpus and xofxpus.\n\nquvrpus is jemqpus.\n\njemqpus is pipnpus and rubqpus.\n\npipnpus is fernpus.\n\nfernpus is hoqgpus and wufmpus.\n\nhoqgpus is zexvpus and vayzpus.\n\nzexvpus is ridxpus and yaxrpus.\n\nridxpus is cupgpus and zehnpus.\n\ncupgpus is puqrpus and xosmpus.\n\npuqrpus is gowypus.\n\ngowypus is babbpus and ratspus and vulmpus.\n\nFinally! We have gowypus which contains babbpus.\n\nSo from soxspus, through a long chain, we eventually reach gowypus which has babbpus.\n\nBut does this mean that soxspus is babbpus? Not directly. Since soxspus is jedjpus and kohtpus, and jedjpus leads to vasfpus, etc., and eventually to gowypus, but gowypus is a category that includes babbpus, but for soxspus to be babbpus, it must be that soxspus is part of gowypus, but from the chain, we have soxspus -> jedjpus -> vasfpus -> dumcpus -> ... -> puqrpus -> gowypus -> babbpus.\n\nBut note that \"is\" means belongs to category, so if A is B, and B is C, then A is C? In this context, it seems that the relation is transitive? Let's see the note: \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". So if A belongs to B, and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C? That seems reasonable for containment or category membership.\n\nFor example, from the chain, vasfpus is dumcpus, and dumcpus is nedlpus, so vasfpus is nedlpus? Similarly, from above, we have multiple such chains.\n\nIn fact, from the given, there is direct statement: dumcpus is sivnpus, and also dumcpus is nedlpus, so dumcpus belongs to both.\n\nSo yes, the relation should be transitive. So if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nTherefore, from soxspus, we can trace to gowypus, and since gowypus is babbpus (meaning gowypus contains babbpus? No, let's read: \"gowypus is babbpus and ratspus and vulmpus\" so gowypus belongs to babbpus? Or does it mean that gowypus consists of babbpus, etc.?\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". So when we say \"gowypus is babbpus\", it means gowypus belongs to category babbpus? Or does it mean that babbpus is a part of gowypus? The phrasing is ambiguous.\n\nLet's look at the note: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\"\n\nSo, if we say \"gowypus is babbpus\", it means gowypus belongs to category babbpus, so babbpus is a category, and gowypus is a member of that category. Similarly, if we say \"puqrpus is gowypus\", it means puqrpus belongs to category gowypus.\n\nBut in the statement \"gowypus is babbpus and ratspus and vulmpus\", this seems to imply that gowypus belongs to multiple categories: babbpus, ratspus, and vulmpus. So babbpus is a category, and gowypus is in that category.\n\nThen, if we have puqrpus is gowypus, then puqrpus is in gowypus category, and since gowypus is in babbpus category, then puqrpus is in babbpus category? Yes, by transitivity.\n\nSimilarly, from soxspus, we trace to puqrpus, so soxspus should be in babbpus category.\n\nBut we need to see if x is babbpus. x is fabfpus, and fabfpus is soxspus and hoqcpus. So since fabfpus is soxspus, and soxspus is in babbpus category, then fabfpus is in babbpus category, so x is in babbpus category? That means x is babbpus? But let's confirm.\n\nThe question is: \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" So if x is in the category babbpus, then it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nBut we need to ensure that the chain is correct.\n\nFrom soxspus to babbpus:\n\nsoxspus is jedjpus and kohtpus → so soxspus belongs to jedjpus category? No: \"soxspus is jedjpus\" means soxspus belongs to category jedjpus? Or does it mean that jedjpus is a category and soxspus is contained in it?\n\nFrom the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so B is the category. So when we say \"soxspus is jedjpus\", it means soxspus belongs to category jedjpus, so jedjpus is the category.\n\nSimilarly, \"jedjpus is vasfpus\" means jedjpus belongs to category vasfpus.\n\nSo for transitivity: if A is B and B is C, then A is C, meaning A belongs to category C.\n\nSo from soxspus is jedjpus, and jedjpus is vasfpus, so soxspus is vasfpus.\n\nThen vasfpus is dumcpus, so soxspus is dumcpus.\n\ndumcpus is nedlpus, so soxspus is nedlpus.\n\nnedlpus is puclpus and judypus, so nedlpus belongs to puclpus category? Since \"nedlpus is puclpus\" means nedlpus belongs to category puclpus.\n\nSo soxspus is nedlpus, and nedlpus is puclpus, so soxspus is puclpus.\n\nThen puclpus is zuqrpus, so soxspus is zuqrpus.\n\nzuqrpus is dazkpus and pomdpus, so zuqrpus belongs to dazkpus category, so soxspus is dazkpus.\n\ndazkpus is ruvvpus and noddpus, so dazkpus belongs to ruvvpus category, so soxspus is ruvvpus.\n\nruvvpus is yumypus and titppus, so ruvvpus belongs to yumypus category, so soxspus is yumypus.\n\nyumypus is vovkpus and caqzpus, so yumypus belongs to vovkpus category, so soxspus is vovkpus.\n\nBut from earlier, vovkpus is yizypus? From the list: \"vovkpus is yizypus.\" so vovkpus belongs to yizypus category, so soxspus is yizypus.\n\nyizypus is boygpus and catnpus, so yizypus belongs to boygpus category, so soxspus is boygpus.\n\nboygpus is gaxrpus, so soxspus is gaxrpus.\n\ngaxrpus is mixnpus, so soxspus is mixnpus.\n\nmixnpus is labxpus, so soxspus is labxpus.\n\nlabxpus is popbpus and zockpus, so labxpus belongs to popbpus category, so soxspus is popbpus.\n\npopbpus is vovxpus, so soxspus is vovxpus.\n\nvovxpus is navdpus, so soxspus is navdpus.\n\nnavdpus is muknpus, so soxspus is muknpus.\n\nmuknpus is leytpus, so soxspus is leytpus.\n\nleytpus is jagfpus, so soxspus is jagfpus.\n\njagfpus is sarwpus, so soxspus is sarwpus.\n\nsarwpus is jimrpus, so soxspus is jimrpus.\n\njimrpus is xojppus, so soxspus is xojppus.\n\nxojppus is jujjpus, so soxspus is jujjpus.\n\njujjpus is zegvpus and xivqpus, so jujjpus belongs to zegvpus category, so soxspus is zegvpus.\n\nzegvpus is fedwpus, so soxspus is fedwpus.\n\nfedwpus is wacdpus and zikdpus and kichpus, so fedwpus belongs to wacdpus category, so soxspus is wacdpus.\n\nwacdpus is tindpus, so soxspus is tindpus.\n\ntindpus is dulspus, so soxspus is dulspus.\n\ndulspus is dutbpus, so soxspus is dutbpus.\n\ndutbpus is qodbpus and cozxpus, so dutbpus belongs to qodbpus category, so soxspus is qodbpus.\n\nqodbpus is govkpus, so soxspus is govkpus.\n\ngovkpus is fapcpus, so soxspus is fapcpus.\n\nfapcpus is jonrpus and yobspus and rojppus and makgpus, so fapcpus belongs to jonrpus category, so soxspus is jonrpus.\n\njonrpus is wakvpus, so soxspus is wakvpus.\n\nwakvpus is yodjpus and gukvpus, so wakvpus belongs to yodjpus category, so soxspus is yodjpus.\n\nyodjpus is depbpus, so soxspus is depbpus.\n\ndepbpus is talppus and gazxpus, so depbpus belongs to talppus category, so soxspus is talppus.\n\ntalppus is guvkpus, so soxspus is guvkpus.\n\nguvkpus is vewgpus, so soxspus is vewgpus.\n\nvewgpus is tonwpus, so soxspus is tonwpus.\n\ntonwpus is wurjpus, so soxspus is wurjpus.\n\nwurjpus is wilppus, so soxspus is wilppus.\n\nwilppus is viphpus and xodbpus and todkpus, so wilppus belongs to viphpus category, so soxspus is viphpus.\n\nviphpus is yicnpus, so soxspus is yicnpus.\n\nyicnpus is tecqpus, so soxspus is tecqpus.\n\ntecqpus is manvpus, so soxspus is manvpus.\n\nmanvpus is huhnpus, so soxspus is huhnpus.\n\nhuhnpus is zabqpus, so soxspus is zabqpus.\n\nzabqpus is xudcpus and diwmpus, so zabqpus belongs to xudcpus category, so soxspus is xudcpus.\n\nxudcpus is vohgpus, so soxspus is vohgpus.\n\nvohgpus is dedfpus, so soxspus is dedfpus.\n\ndedfpus is votppus, so soxspus is votppus.\n\nvotppus is wiwxpus, so soxspus is wiwxpus.\n\nwiwxpus is naszpus, so soxspus is naszpus.\n\nnaszpus is rabhpus, so soxspus is rabhpus.\n\nrabhpus is jumjpus, so soxspus is jumjpus.\n\njumjpus is loyypus, so soxspus is loyypus.\n\nloyypus is rumxpus and goylpus, so loyypus belongs to rumxpus category, so soxspus is rumxpus.\n\nrumxpus is quvrpus and xofxpus, so rumxpus belongs to quvrpus category, so soxspus is quvrpus.\n\nquvrpus is jemqpus, so soxspus is jemqpus.\n\njemqpus is pipnpus and rubqpus, so jemqpus belongs to pipnpus category, so soxspus is pipnpus.\n\npipnpus is fernpus, so soxspus is fernpus.\n\nfernpus is hoqgpus and wufmpus, so fernpus belongs to hoqgpus category, so soxspus is hoqgpus.\n\nhoqgpus is zexvpus and vayzpus, so hoqgpus belongs to zexvpus category, so soxspus is zexvpus.\n\nzexvpus is ridxpus and yaxrpus, so zexvpus belongs to ridxpus category, so soxspus is ridxpus.\n\nridxpus is cupgpus and zehnpus, so ridxpus belongs to cupgpus category, so soxspus is cupgpus.\n\ncupgpus is puqrpus and xosmpus, so cupgpus belongs to puqrpus category, so soxspus is puqrpus.\n\npuqrpus is gowypus, so soxspus is gowypus.\n\ngowypus is babbpus and ratspus and vulmpus, so gowypus belongs to babbpus category, so soxspus is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, soxspus is babbpus.\n\nSince x is fabfpus and fabfpus is soxspus, so x is soxspus, and since soxspus is babbpus, then x is babbpus.\n\nSo it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" Since we have x is babbpus, it is true for babbpus.\n\nWe don't have information about babcpus or babppus, but since the question is \"or\", if one is true, it is true.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut we also have that fabfpus is hoqcpus, which is unknown, but since fabfpus is soxspus, and soxspus is babbpus, so regardless of hoqcpus, x is babbpus.\n\nSo for the question, it is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is true.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nFirst, I need to determine if x is either babbpus, babcpus, or babppus.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

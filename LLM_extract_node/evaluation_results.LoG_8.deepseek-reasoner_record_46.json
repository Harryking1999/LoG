  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is in the categories babbpus, babcpus, and babppus. The given information is a chain of \"is\" relationships, meaning that x belongs to some categories, and I need to trace through these to see if it connects to the required categories.\n\nI know that x is zoxnpus from the information: \"x is zoxnpus\". So, x belongs to zoxnpus.\n\nNow, I need to find out what zoxnpus is. From the information: \"zoxnpus is sopypus\". So, zoxnpus belongs to sopypus.\n\nThen, sopypus is magspus: \"sopypus is magspus\".\n\nmagspus is zitrpus and robspus: \"magspus is zitrpus and robspus\".

So fetxpus is babbpus.\n\nSo, through this long chain, we have a connection from x to fetxpus, which means x is in fetxpus, and since fetxpus is babbpus, x is babbpus.\n\nBut we need to check for babcpus and babppus as well.\n\nbabcpus and babppus are under firfpus: \"firfpus is babcpus and babppus\"\n\nNow, is there a connection from x to firfpus?\n\nFrom above, we have hecxpus is firfpus: \"hecxpus is firfpus\"\n\nAnd wifkpus is hecxpus and nucqpus: \"wifkpus is hecxpus and nucqpus\"\n\nBut from earlier, we have darhpus is wifkpus and ganvpus: \"darhpus is wifkpus and ganvpus\"\n\nAnd dumfpus is darhpus: \"dumfpus is darhpus\"\n\nAnd from the chain above, we have dumfpus in the chain from x through lepzpus, etc.\n\nLet's see: from x, we went through a long path to dumfpus.\n\nFrom lepzpus is dumfpus and buyvpus, and we have huflpus is lepzpus, bivwpus is huflpus, jezspus is bivwpus, poccpus is jezspus, hetdpus is poccpus, kolnpus is hetdpus, rintpus is kolnpus, wifppus is rintpus, xilppus is wifppus, vubtpus is xilppus, luwxpus is vubtpus, fuywpus is luwxpus, qexlpus is fuywpus, tevgpus is qexlpus, vibhpus is tevgpus, devkpus is vibhpus, wasppus is devkpus, fildpus is wasppus, jarypus is fildpus, ceqzpus is jarypus, neghpus is ceqzpus, noddpus is neghpus, himnpus is noddpus, nevvpus is himnpus, wafhpus is nevvpus, bavhpus is wafhpus, yiwcpus is bavhpus, gagfpus is yiwcpus, dahwpus is gagfpus, divvpus is dahwpus, hughpus is divvpus, virqpus is hughpus, jujjpus is virqpus, zitrpus is jujjpus, magspus is zitrpus, sopypus is magspus, zoxnpus is sopypus, x is zoxnpus.\n\nThat's the chain I just traced, but it seems very long, and I missed dumfpus. In this chain, I have virqpus, but I need to get to dumfpus.\n\nFrom jujjpus is virqpus and civgpus, but civgpus might not be connected, but I have zitrpus is jujjpus, which is in magspus, but from magspus, I also have robspus, but I didn't use robspus.\n\nIn the chain above, I have magspus is zitrpus and robspus, but I only followed zitrpus. I need to see if robspus leads anywhere, but from the information, robspus isn't defined further, so probably not helpful.\n\nBut I need to get to dumfpus for firfpus.\n\nFrom the chain, I have lepzpus is dumfpus, but how do I get to lepzpus? From huflpus is lepzpus, and bivwpus is huflpus, and jezspus is bivwpus, and poccpus is jezspus, etc., but in the chain from x, I have poccpus in the chain through hetdpus and kolnpus and rintpus.\n\nLet's see: from wifppus is rintpus and felvpus, and rintpus is kolnpus and xirdpus, kolnpus is hetdpus, hetdpus is poccpus, so yes, poccpus is in the chain.\n\nBut poccpus is jezspus and ruzfpus, and jezspus is bivwpus, bivwpus is huflpus, huflpus is lepzpus, lepzpus is dumfpus and buyvpus.\n\nSo, from x, through the chain, we reach dumfpus.\n\nSince dumfpus is darhpus, and darhpus is wifkpus and ganvpus, and wifkpus is hecxpus and nucqpus, and hecxpus is firfpus, so hecxpus is firfpus.\n\nTherefore, since dumfpus is darhpus, and darhpus is wifkpus, so dumfpus is wifkpus, and wifkpus is hecxpus, so dumfpus is hecxpus, and hecxpus is firfpus, so dumfpus is firfpus.\n\nAnd since firfpus is babcpus and babppus, so dumfpus is babcpus and babppus.\n\nNow, from the chain, x is connected to dumfpus, so x is dumfpus? No, remember that \"is\" means belongs to category, so if x is zoxnpus, and zoxnpus is sopypus, etc., eventually, through the chain, x belongs to all these categories, including dumfpus.\n\nSo, since dumfpus is firfpus, and firfpus is babcpus and babppus, then x is babcpus and babppus.\n\nAlso, from earlier, we have x is fetxpus through the chain, and fetxpus is babbpus, so x is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo, the statement is true.\n\nBut let me confirm if the chain is correct.\n\nI have two paths: one to fetxpus and one to firfpus.\n\nFrom gebtpus is qiftpus and labcpus, and qiftpus is fetxpus and jabkpus, so gebtpus is fetxpus.\n\nAnd dumfpus is gebtpus, so dumfpus is gebtpus, so dumfpus is fetxpus.\n\nBut we already have dumfpus is firfpus through darhpus and wifkpus and hecxpus.\n\nSo, dumfpus is both fetxpus and firfpus, which is consistent since fetxpus is babbpus and firfpus is babcpus and babppus.\n\nAnd since x is dumfpus through the chain, so x is all of them.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see the direct chain from x to dumfpus.\n\nFrom x: x is zoxnpus\n\nzoxnpus is sopypus\n\nsopypus is magspus\n\nmagspus is zitrpus and robspus — we take zitrpus\n\nzitrpus is jujjpus\n\njujjpus is virqpus and civgpus — we take virqpus\n\nvirqpus is hughpus and vumcpus — we take hughpus\n\nhughpus is divvpus\n\ndivvpus is dahwpus\n\ndahwpus is gagfpus\n\ngagfpus is yiwcpus\n\nyiwcpus is bavhpus and ceqppus — we take bavhpus\n\nbavhpus is wafhpus\n\nwafhpus is nevvpus and qefvpus — we take nevvpus\n\nnevvpus is himnpus\n\nhimnpus is noddpus\n\nnoddpus is neghpus — and also noddpus is sulppus, but neghpus is needed\n\nneghpus is ceqzpus\n\nceqzpus is jarypus and vunkpus — we take jarypus\n\njarypus is fildpus\n\nfildpus is wasppus and kazqpus — we take wasppus\n\nwasppus is devkpus\n\ndevkpus is vibhpus\n\nvibhpus is tevgpus and miyfpus and xekgpus and sincpus — we take tevgpus\n\ntevgpus is qexlpus\n\nqexlpus is fuywpus\n\nfuywpus is luwxpus and resjpus — we take luwxpus\n\nluwxpus is vubtpus\n\nvubtpus is xilppus and zapwpus and zaydpus — we take xilppus\n\nxilppus is wifppus\n\nwifppus is rintpus and felvpus — we take rintpus\n\nrintpus is kolnpus and xirdpus — we take kolnpus\n\nkolnpus is hetdpus\n\nhetdpus is poccpus\n\npoccpus is jezspus and ruzfpus — we take jezspus\n\njezspus is bivwpus\n\nbivwpus is huflpus\n\nhuflpus is lepzpus\n\nlepzpus is dumfpus and buyvpus — we take dumfpus\n\nSo, indeed, x is dumfpus (meaning x belongs to dumfpus category).\n\nNow, dumfpus is gebtpus: \"dumfpus is gebtpus\"\n\ngebtpus is qiftpus and labcpus: \"gebtpus is qiftpus and labcpus\"\n\nqiftpus is fetxpus and jabkpus: \"qiftpus is fetxpus and jabkpus\"\n\nSo, dumfpus is gebtpus, which is qiftpus, which is fetxpus, so dumfpus is fetxpus.\n\nAnd fetxpus is babbpus: \"fetxpus is babbpus\", so dumfpus is babbpus, thus x is babbpus.\n\nAlso, dumfpus is darhpus: \"dumfpus is darhpus\"\n\ndarhpus is wifkpus and ganvpus: \"darhpus is wifkpus and ganvpus\"\n\nwifkpus is hecxpus and nucqpus: \"wifkpus is hecxpus and nucqpus\"\n\nhecxpus is firfpus: \"hecxpus is firfpus\"\n\nfirfpus is babcpus and babppus: \"firfpus is babcpus and babppus\"\n\nSo, dumfpus is darhpus, which is wifkpus, which is hecxpus, which is firfpus, which is babcpus and babppus, so dumfpus is babcpus and babppus, thus x is babcpus and babppus.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nThe question is: \"x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus?\" which means x belongs to all three categories, which we have established.\n\nThus, it is true.",

No, remember that \"is\" means belongs to category, so if x is zoxnpus, and zoxnpus is sopypus, etc., eventually, through the chain, x belongs to all these categories, including dumfpus.\n\nSo, since dumfpus is firfpus, and firfpus is babcpus and babppus, then x is babcpus and babppus.\n\nAlso, from earlier, we have x is fetxpus through the chain, and fetxpus is babbpus, so x is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo, the statement is true.\n\nBut let me confirm if the chain is correct.\n\nI have two paths: one to fetxpus and one to firfpus.\n\nFrom gebtpus is qiftpus and labcpus, and qiftpus is fetxpus and jabkpus, so gebtpus is fetxpus.\n\nAnd dumfpus is gebtpus, so dumfpus is gebtpus, so dumfpus is fetxpus.\n\nBut we already have dumfpus is firfpus through darhpus and wifkpus and hecxpus.\n\nSo, dumfpus is both fetxpus and firfpus, which is consistent since fetxpus is babbpus and firfpus is babcpus and babppus.\n\nAnd since x is dumfpus through the chain, so x is all of them.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see the direct chain from x to dumfpus.\n\nFrom x: x is zoxnpus\n\nzoxnpus is sopypus\n\nsopypus is magspus\n\nmagspus is zitrpus and robspus — we take zitrpus\n\nzitrpus is jujjpus\n\njujjpus is virqpus and civgpus — we take virqpus\n\nvirqpus is hughpus and vumcpus — we take hughpus\n\nhughpus is divvpus\n\ndivvpus is dahwpus\n\ndahwpus is gagfpus\n\ngagfpus is yiwcpus\n\nyiwcpus is bavhpus and ceqppus — we take bavhpus\n\nbavhpus is wafhpus\n\nwafhpus is nevvpus and qefvpus — we take nevvpus\n\nnevvpus is himnpus\n\nhimnpus is noddpus\n\nnoddpus is neghpus — and also noddpus is sulppus, but neghpus is needed\n\nneghpus is ceqzpus\n\nceqzpus is jarypus and vunkpus — we take jarypus\n\njarypus is fildpus\n\nfildpus is wasppus and kazqpus — we take wasppus\n\nwasppus is devkpus\n\ndevkpus is vibhpus\n\nvibhpus is tevgpus and miyfpus and xekgpus and sincpus — we take tevgpus\n\ntevgpus is qexlpus\n\nqexlpus is fuywpus\n\nfuywpus is luwxpus and resjpus — we take luwxpus\n\nluwxpus is vubtpus\n\nvubtpus is xilppus and zapwpus and zaydpus — we take xilppus\n\nxilppus is wifppus\n\nwifppus is rintpus and felvpus — we take rintpus\n\nrintpus is kolnpus and xirdpus — we take kolnpus\n\nkolnpus is hetdpus\n\nhetdpus is poccpus\n\npoccpus is jezspus and ruzfpus — we take jezspus\n\njezspus is bivwpus\n\nbivwpus is huflpus\n\nhuflpus is lepzpus\n\nlepzpus is dumfpus and buyvpus — we take dumfpus\n\nSo, indeed, x is dumfpus (meaning x belongs to dumfpus category).\n\nNow, dumfpus is gebtpus: \"dumfpus is gebtpus\"\n\ngebtpus is qiftpus and labcpus: \"gebtpus is qiftpus and labcpus\"\n\nqiftpus is fetxpus and jabkpus: \"qiftpus is fetxpus and jabkpus\"\n\nSo, dumfpus is gebtpus, which is qiftpus, which is fetxpus, so dumfpus is fetxpus.\n\nAnd fetxpus is babbpus: \"fetxpus is babbpus\", so dumfpus is babbpus, thus x is babbpus.\n\nAlso, dumfpus is darhpus: \"dumfpus is darhpus\"\n\ndarhpus is wifkpus and ganvpus: \"darhpus is wifkpus and ganvpus\"\n\nwifkpus is hecxpus and nucqpus: \"wifkpus is hecxpus and nucqpus\"\n\nhecxpus is firfpus: \"hecxpus is firfpus\"\n\nfirfpus is babcpus and babppus: \"firfpus is babcpus and babppus\"\n\nSo, dumfpus is darhpus, which is wifkpus, which is hecxpus, which is firfpus, which is babcpus and babppus, so dumfpus is babcpus and babppus, thus x is babcpus and babppus.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nThe question is: \"x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus?\" which means x belongs to all three categories, which we have established.\n\nThus, it is true.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8.

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

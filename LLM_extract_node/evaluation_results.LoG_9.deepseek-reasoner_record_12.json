  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x belongs to the categories babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus. The given information states that \"x is cofspus\". So, x is a type of cofspus.\n\nI need to trace through the relationships to see if cofspus eventually leads to babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus.\n\nLet me list out all the relevant statements from the given information:\n\n- x is cofspus\n\n- cofspus is dafxpus and gifxpus\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus and babmpus and babnpus. From the information, I see that moljpus is babbpus and hipypus, and nitzpus is babmpus and babnpus. Also, moljpus is nitzpus? Let's see: \"moljpus is nitzpus\" – no, it says \"moljpus is nitzpus\" but wait, let's read carefully.\n\nActually, from the information: \"moljpus is nitzpus\" – yes, it says \"moljpus is nitzpus\" and then \"nitzpus is babmpus and babnpus\". So moljpus is nitzpus, which means moljpus belongs to nitzpus, and nitzpus is babmpus and babnpus, so moljpus should be babmpus and babnpus? But also, moljpus is babbpus and hipypus? That seems confusing. Let's see the exact text.\n\nHere: \"moljpus is nitzpus.\" and then \"nitzpus is babmpus and babnpus.\" and also \"moljpus is babbpus and hipypus.\" So moljpus is both nitzpus and babbpus and hipypus? But since nitzpus is babmpus and babnpus, and moljpus is nitzpus, then moljpus should be babmpus and babnpus as well. But it also directly says moljpus is babbpus, so moljpus is babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus? That might be possible if babbpus, babmpus, babnpus are categories that moljpus belongs to.\n\nBut I need to see if x is connected to moljpus.\n\nNow, recvpus is moljpus: \"recvpus is moljpus.\"\n\nAnd xokqpus is recvpus: \"xokqpus is recvpus.\"\n\nAnd felspus is xokqpus: \"felspus is xokqpus.\"\n\nAnd keympus is felspus: \"keympus is felspus.\"\n\nBut keympus is also tevkpus: \"keympus is tevkpus.\"\n\nAnd tevkpus is qexkpus: \"tevkpus is qexkpus.\"\n\nBut that might not be directly helpful.

That might be possible.\n\nBut let's see where dafxpus leads.\n\ndafxpus is suzrpus: \"dafxpus is suzrpus\" – from \"dafxpus is suzrpus and qajnpus.\"\n\nsuzrpus is ribbpus and zelwpus: \"suzrpus is ribbpus and zelwpus.\"\n\nBut also, suzrpus is biclpus and naldpus: \"suzrpus is biclpus and naldpus.\" So suzrpus has multiple categories.\n\nribbpus is nicrpus and vultpus and wefspus: \"ribbpus is nicrpus and vultpus and wefspus.\"\n\nnicrpus is zoftpus and xiyxpus: \"nicrpus is zoftpus and xiyxpus.\"\n\nzoftpus is vescpus: \"zoftpus is vescpus.\"\n\nvescpus is cixlpus and xohxpus: \"vescpus is cixlpus and xohxpus.\"\n\ncixlpus is sojspus: \"cixlpus is sojspus.\"\n\nsojspus is xurcpus: \"sojspus is xurcpus.\"\n\nxurcpus is qepwpus and geskpus: \"xurcpus is qepwpus and geskpus.\"\n\nqepwpus is xerxpus: \"qepwpus is xerxpus.\"\n\nxerxpus is tefxpus and towfpus: \"xerxpus is tefxpus and towfpus.\"\n\ntefxpus is nidcpus and qedgpus: \"tefxpus is nidcpus and qedgpus.\"\n\nnidcpus is palzpus and nejvpus: \"nidcpus is palzpus and nejvpus.\"\n\npalzpus is vufqpus and qurkpus: \"palzpus is vufqpus and qurkpus.\"\n\nvufqpus is tohcpus: \"vufqpus is tohcpus.\"\n\ntohcpus is mukkpus and sidfpus and gewgpus: \"tohcpus is mukkpus and sidfpus and gewgpus.\"\n\nmukkpus is koncpus and pisnpus: \"mukkpus is koncpus and pisnpus.\"\n\nkoncpus is bifvpus: \"koncpus is bifvpus.\"\n\nbifvpus is zemppus: \"bifvpus is zemppus.\"\n\nzemppus is fehzpus: \"zemppus is fehzpus.\"\n\nfehzpus is zasvpus and pamqpus: \"fehzpus is zasvpus and pamqpus.\"\n\nzasvpus is hufspus: \"zasvpus is hufspus.\"\n\nhufspus is fevppus and wiskpus: \"hufspus is fevppus and wiskpus.\"\n\nfevppus is dakqpus: \"fevppus is dakqpus.\"\n\ndakqpus is zuynpus: \"dakqpus is zuynpus.\"\n\nzuynpus is cimspus and jefxpus: \"zuynpus is cimspus and jefxpus.\"\n\ncimspus is ciqppus: \"cimspus is ciqppus.\"\n\nciqppus is pojgpus and hulrpus: \"ciqppus is pojgpus and hulrpus.\"\n\npojgpus is numtpus: \"pojgpus is numtpus.\"\n\nnumtpus is gorfpus and cetnpus: \"numtpus is gorfpus and cetnpus.\"\n\ngorfpus is poyhpus: \"gorfpus is poyhpus.\"\n\npoyhpus is tenjpus and cufzpus: \"poyhpus is tenjpus and cufzpus.\"\n\ntenjpus is sumnpus and vexhpus: \"tenjpus is sumnpus and vexhpus.\"\n\nsumnpus is zeshpus: \"sumnpus is zeshpus.\"\n\nzeshpus is ragcpus and joxnpus: \"zeshpus is ragcpus and joxnpus.\"\n\nragcpus is palrpus: \"ragcpus is palrpus.\"\n\npalrpus is sewbpus: \"palrpus is sewbpus.\"\n\nsewbpus is toxnpus: from \"sewbpus is toxnpus\" but also \"sewbpus is sejspus\" from earlier.\n\nsewbpus is sejspus: \"sewbpus is sejspus.\"\n\nsejspus is vanjpus: \"sejspus is vanjpus.\"\n\nvanjpus is lomppus: \"vanjpus is lomppus.\"\n\nlomppus is rohxpus: \"lomppus is rohxpus.\" but also \"lomppus is fasqpus\" from \"lomppus is fasqpus.\"\n\nfasqpus is dujwpus: \"fasqpus is dujwpus.\"\n\ndujwpus is xinspus: \"dujwpus is xinspus.\"\n\nxinspus is nonzpus and fewnpus and quvcpus: \"xinspus is nonzpus and fewnpus and quvcpus.\"\n\nnonzpus is wecxpus: \"nonzpus is wecxpus.\"\n\nwecxpus is fulwpus: \"wecxpus is fulwpus.\"\n\nfulwpus is mixvpus: \"fulwpus is mixvpus.\" and also \"fulwpus is keympus\" from \"keympus is felspus\" but wait, keympus is felspus, and felspus is xokqpus, etc.\n\nThis is getting very complicated, and I seem to be going in circles.

Let's check the information.\n\nFrom the given: \"fulwpus is keympus\" – yes! \"fulwpus is keympus.\" and also \"keympus is felspus\" but that's fine.\n\nNow, wecxpus is fulwpus, and wecxpus is from nonzpus, and nonzpus is from xinspus, and xinspus is from dujwpus, and dujwpus is from fasqpus, and fasqpus is from lomppus, and lomppus is from vanjpus, and vanjpus is from sejspus, and sejspus is from sewbpus, and sewbpus is from palrpus, and palrpus is from ragcpus, and ragcpus is from zeshpus, and zeshpus is from sumnpus, and sumnpus is from tenjpus, and tenjpus is from poyhpus, and poyhpus is from gorfpus, and gorfpus is from numtpus, and numtpus is from pojgpus, and pojgpus is from ciqppus, and ciqppus is from cimspus, and cimspus is from zuynpus, and zuynpus is from dakqpus, and dakqpus is from fevppus, and fevppus is from hufspus, and hufspus is from zasvpus, and zasvpus is from fehzpus, and fehzpus is from zemppus, and zemppus is from bifvpus, and bifvpus is from koncpus, and koncpus is from mukkpus, and mukkpus is from tohcpus, and tohcpus is from vufqpus, and vufqpus is from palzpus, and palzpus is from nidcpus, and nidcpus is from tefxpus, and tefxpus is from xerxpus, and xerxpus is from qepwpus, and qepwpus is from xurcpus, and xurcpus is from sojspus, and sojspus is from cixlpus, and cixlpus is from vescpus, and vescpus is from zoftpus, and zoftpus is from nicrpus, and nicrpus is from ribbpus, and ribbpus is from suzrpus, and suzrpus is from dafxpus, and dafxpus is from cofspus, and cofspus is x!\n\nSo indeed, there is a long chain from x to keympus through this path.\n\nSince x is cofspus, cofspus is dafxpus, dafxpus is suzrpus, suzrpus is ribbpus, ribbpus is nicrpus, nicrpus is zoftpus, zoftpus is vescpus, vescpus is cixlpus, cixlpus is sojspus, sojspus is xurcpus, xurcpus is qepwpus, qepwpus is xerxpus, xerxpus is tefxpus, tefxpus is nidcpus, nidcpus is palzpus, palzpus is vufqpus, vufqpus is tohcpus, tohcpus is mukkpus, mukkpus is koncpus, koncpus is bifvpus, bifvpus is zemppus, zemppus is fehzpus, fehzpus is zasvpus, zasvpus is hufspus, hufspus is fevppus, fevppus is dakqpus, dakqpus is zuynpus, zuynpus is cimspus, cimspus is ciqppus, ciqppus is pojgpus, pojgpus is numtpus, numtpus is gorfpus, gorfpus is poyhpus, poyhpus is tenjpus, tenjpus is sumnpus, sumnpus is zeshpus, zeshpus is ragcpus, ragcpus is palrpus, palrpus is sewbpus, sewbpus is sejspus, sejspus is vanjpus, vanjpus is lomppus, lomppus is fasqpus, fasqpus is dujwpus, dujwpus is xinspus, xinspus is nonzpus, nonzpus is wecxpus, wecxpus is fulwpus, fulwpus is keympus.\n\nSo x is keympus through this long chain.\n\nNow, keympus is felspus: \"keympus is felspus\"\n\nfelspus is xokqpus: \"felspus is xokqpus\"\n\nxokqpus is recvpus: \"xokqpus is recvpus\"\n\nrecvpus is moljpus: \"recvpus is moljpus\"\n\nSo x is moljpus.\n\nNow, moljpus is babbpus and hipypus: \"moljpus is babbpus and hipypus\"\n\nAlso, moljpus is nitzpus: \"moljpus is nitzpus\" – from \"moljpus is nitzpus\"?\nWait, let's check the information: \"moljpus is nitzpus.\" Yes, it says that.\n\nAnd nitzpus is babmpus and babnpus: \"nitzpus is babmpus and babnpus\"\n\nTherefore, since moljpus is nitzpus, and nitzpus is babmpus and babnpus, so moljpus is babmpus and babnpus.\n\nAnd moljpus is directly babbpus.\n\nSo moljpus is babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus.\n\nSince x is moljpus, then x is babbpus and babmpus and babnpus.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nBut let me confirm if there is any contradiction or missing link.\n\nFrom above, we have x is keympus, and keympus is felspus, etc., to moljpus.\n\nAnd moljpus has the required categories.\n\nSo, yes.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, yes.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

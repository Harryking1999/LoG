That is, does x belong to the category babcpus?\n\nI need to trace through the given information to see if I can establish a connection between x and babcpus.\n\nList out all the given statements:\n\n1. kugqpus is yusfpus. → kugqpus ⊆ yusfpus\n\n2. x is kugqpus and zantpus. → x ∈ kugqpus and x ∈ zantpus\n\n3. qiyspus is babcpus and zivnpus. → qiyspus ⊆ babcpus and qiyspus ⊆ zivnpus\n\n4. joydpus is qiyspus. → joydpus ⊆ qiyspus\n\n5. joydpus is zugppus and zigbpus. → joydpus ⊆ zugppus and joydpus ⊆ zigbpus\n\n6. zugppus is dozppus and gojbpus. → zugppus ⊆ dozppus and zugppus ⊆ gojbpus\n\n7. yusfpus is joydpus and wibhpus. → yusfpus ⊆ joydpus and yusfpus ⊆ wibhpus\n\nNote: The \"is\" here means subset or membership, but since we're dealing with categories, it might be better to think in terms of set inclusion. However, from statement 2, x is an element of kugqpus, so x is an instance, while other things might be categories.\n\nI need to be careful about whether something is a category or an instance. From the statements, things like kugqpus, yusfpus, etc., seem to be categories, and x is an instance that belongs to categories.\n\nBut in statement 2, x is said to be kugqpus and zantpus, meaning x is in those categories.

If A is an instance, then \"A is B\" means A is a member of B.\n\nIn the statements, we have both cases.

But wait, joydpus is a category, and zugppus and zigbpus are categories, so yes, joydpus is contained in both zugppus and zigbpus, meaning joydpus ⊆ zugppus and joydpus ⊆ zigbpus.\n\nBut from statement 4, joydpus ⊆ qiyspus, and from statement 5, joydpus ⊆ zugppus and joydpus ⊆ zigbpus.\n\nThen \"zugppus is dozppus and gojbpus\" – zugppus ⊆ dozppus and zugppus ⊆ gojbpus.\n\nFinally, \"yusfpus is joydpus and wibhpus\" – yusfpus ⊆ joydpus and yusfpus ⊆ wibhpus.\n\nNow, I need to find if x is babcpus, i.e., x ∈ babcpus.\n\nFrom statement 2, x ∈ kugqpus and x ∈ zantpus.\n\nFrom statement 1, kugqpus ⊆ yusfpus, so since x ∈ kugqpus, then x ∈ yusfpus.\n\nFrom statement 7, yusfpus ⊆ joydpus and yusfpus ⊆ wibhpus, so since x ∈ yusfpus, then x ∈ joydpus.\n\nFrom statement 4, joydpus ⊆ qiyspus, so x ∈ joydpus implies x ∈ qiyspus.\n\nFrom statement 3, qiyspus ⊆ babcpus and qiyspus ⊆ zivnpus, so since x ∈ qiyspus, then x ∈ babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is indeed babcpus.\n\nSo, it should be true.\n\nLet me double-check if there are any contradictions or missing links.\n\nWe have x ∈ kugqpus → x ∈ yusfpus → x ∈ joydpus → x ∈ qiyspus → x ∈ babcpus.\n\nAll connections are direct through the subset relations.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.",

Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8.

For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

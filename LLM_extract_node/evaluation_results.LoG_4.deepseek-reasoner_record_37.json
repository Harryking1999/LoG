  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the relationships. The statements are of the form \"A is B\", which means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, it's about categorization or containment.\n\nThe question is: Is x babdpus and babqpus and babxpus? That means, does x belong to all three categories: babdpus, babqpus, and babxpus?\n\nI need to trace what x is and what categories it belongs to based on the given information.\n\nList out all the given statements:\n\n1. ruqfpus is babxpus.\n\n2. x is topgpus.\n\n3. ruqfpus is vaynpus.\n\n4. x is hadwpus.\n\n5. yufkpus is babqpus and wivkpus.\n\n6. helypus is yufkpus.\n\n7. dolmpus is helypus and zincpus.\n\n8. naljpus is sirrpus.\n\n9. sirrpus is babdpus and pejmpus.\n\n10. x is dolmpus.\n\n11. hadwpus is naljpus and zaldpus.\n\n12. topgpus is ruqfpus.\n\nAlso, note that x is mentioned in multiple statements: x is topgpus, x is hadwpus, and x is dolmpus.\n\nI need to find out if x is in babdpus, babqpus, and babxpus.\n\nStart with babxpus: From statement 1, ruqfpus is babxpus. And from statement 12, topgpus is ruqfpus. Since x is topgpus (statement 2), and topgpus is ruqfpus, which is babxpus, so x should be babxpus.\n\nLet's chain it: x is topgpus. topgpus is ruqfpus. ruqfpus is babxpus. Therefore, x is babxpus. So, one part is satisfied: x is babxpus.\n\nNow, next, babqpus: I need to see if x is babqpus.\n\nFrom statement 5, yufkpus is babqpus and wivkpus.\n\nBut I need to connect x to yufkpus.\n\nFrom statement 10, x is dolmpus.\n\nFrom statement 7, dolmpus is helypus and zincpus.\n\nFrom statement 6, helypus is yufkpus.\n\nSo, dolmpus is helypus, and helypus is yufkpus, so dolmpus is yufkpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is dolmpus, x is yufkpus.\n\nAnd since yufkpus is babqpus (from statement 5), so x is babqpus.\n\nSo, x is babqpus. That's the second part.\n\nNow, finally, babdpus: I need to see if x is babdpus.\n\nFrom statement 9, sirrpus is babdpus and pejmpus.\n\nFrom statement 8, naljpus is sirrpus.\n\nBut I need to connect x to sirrpus or naljpus.\n\nFrom statement 4, x is hadwpus.\n\nFrom statement 11, hadwpus is naljpus and zaldpus.\n\nSo, since x is hadwpus, and hadwpus is naljpus, so x is naljpus.\n\nAnd since naljpus is sirrpus (statement 8), so x is sirrpus.\n\nAnd since sirrpus is babdpus (statement 9), so x is babdpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babdpus.\n\nSo, overall, x is babdpus, babqpus, and babxpus.\n\nThe question is: x is babdpus and babqpus and babxpus? Which seems to be true based on the above reasoning.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any contradictions or missing links.\n\nFirst, for babxpus: x -> topgpus -> ruqfpus -> babxpus. Good.\n\nFor babqpus: x -> dolmpus -> helypus -> yufkpus -> babqpus. Good.\n\nFor babdpus: x -> hadwpus -> naljpus -> sirrpus -> babdpus.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

The question is asking if x belongs to any of these categories: babgpus, babrpus, or babspus.\n\nFrom the given information, I know that x is yafppus and saqhpus. So, x belongs to yafppus and also to saqhpus. But I need to see if x connects to babgpus or the others.\n\nI should trace the relationships from x backwards or forwards to see what categories x falls under.\n\nLet me list out all the given statements:\n\n- lirtpus is vuxnpus and difvpus.\n\n- wuxcpus is kastpus.\n\n- mapgpus is poyjpus and nirgpus.\n\n- kutypus is bopbpus and xekspus.\n\n- zayspus is beszpus.\n\n- yuztpus is pudcpus and zosspus.\n\n- ditfpus is nicxpus.\n\n- mewxpus is bormpus.\n\n- rinxpus is mewxpus.\n\n- yafppus is jodbpus.\n\n- damjpus is vabppus and cekppus.\n\n- yafppus is jubkpus.  // Wait, yafppus is also jubkpus?

So yafppus belongs to jodbpus and also to jubkpus.\n\nSimilarly, x is yafppus and saqhpus, so x belongs to yafppus and saqhpus.\n\nNow, I need to find if x is babgpus or babrpus or babspus. From the information, babgpus is mentioned only once: kastpus is babgpus. So kastpus belongs to babgpus.\n\nbabrpus and babspus are not mentioned anywhere in the given information. So, for babrpus and babspus, there is no direct or indirect connection from x, so probably unknown.\n\nBut I need to check for babgpus since it is mentioned.\n\nSo, let's see if x is connected to babgpus.\n\nx is yafppus. So, I need to follow yafppus.\n\nyafppus is jodbpus and jubkpus.\n\nBut jodbpus isn't connected to anything else? Let's see all statements.\n\nyafppus is jodbpus. But jodbpus isn't mentioned on the right side of any other \"is\" statement. Similarly, jubkpus is mentioned: jubkpus is sicxpus.\n\nFrom above: jubkpus is sicxpus.\n\nAnd yafppus is jubkpus, so yafppus belongs to jubkpus, which belongs to sicxpus.\n\nSo, yafppus -> jubkpus -> sicxpus.\n\nNow, sicxpus is damjpus and xebmpus.\n\nSo sicxpus -> damjpus and xebmpus.\n\nNow, damjpus is vabppus and cekppus.\n\nSo damjpus -> vabppus and cekppus.\n\nvabppus is zayspus. So vabppus -> zayspus.\n\nzayspus is beszpus. So zayspus -> beszpus.\n\nbeszpus is diwkpus and yeglpus. So beszpus -> diwkpus and yeglpus.\n\ndiwkpus is sibfpus and dojqpus and kohdpus. So diwkpus -> sibfpus, dojqpus, kohdpus.\n\nsibfpus is mapgpus. So sibfpus -> mapgpus.\n\nmapgpus is poyjpus and nirgpus. So mapgpus -> poyjpus and nirgpus.\n\npoyjpus is kutypus. So poyjpus -> kutypus.\n\nkutypus is bopbpus and xekspus. So kutypus -> bopbpus and xekspus.\n\nbopbpus is cunppus. So bopbpus -> cunppus.\n\ncunppus is yuztpus and rewgpus. So cunppus -> yuztpus and rewgpus.\n\nyuztpus is pudcpus and zosspus. So yuztpus -> pudcpus and zosspus.\n\npudcpus is ditfpus and becnpus. So pudcpus -> ditfpus and becnpus.\n\nditfpus is nicxpus.

So kastpus -> babgpus.\n\nTherefore, through this long chain, we can see that yafppus eventually connects to babgpus.\n\nBut we need to see if x is babgpus. Since x is yafppus, and yafppus belongs to jubkpus, which belongs to sicxpus, and so on, all the way to kastpus, which belongs to babgpus. So, since yafppus is contained in babgpus through this hierarchy, then x, which is yafppus, should also be contained in babgpus.\n\nThe relation is transitive? In this context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if A belongs to B, and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C. So yes, it should be transitive.\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus.\n\nNow, what about babrpus and babspus? These are not mentioned anywhere in the given information. So, there is no way to know if x belongs to babrpus or babspus. Therefore, for babrpus and babspus, it is unknown.\n\nBut the question is: \"is it true or false or unknown: x is babgpus or babrpus or babspus?\"\n\nSince x is babgpus, then the OR statement is true because x is babgpus, so even if it is not babrpus or babspus, the OR is true because one of them is true.\n\nSo, the statement \"x is babgpus or babrpus or babspus\" is true because x is babgpus.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me confirm if there is any other path or if I missed something.\n\nAlso, note that x is also saqhpus, but saqhpus is not connected to anything else, so it doesn't affect the OR statement regarding babgpus, etc.\n\nSo, from the chain, yafppus leads to babgpus.\n\nTo summarize the chain:\n\nyafppus is jubkpus\n\njubkpus is sicxpus\n\nsicxpus is damjpus\n\ndamjpus is vabppus\n\nvabppus is zayspus\n\nzayspus is beszpus\n\nbeszpus is diwkpus\n\ndiwkpus is sibfpus\n\nsibfpus is mapgpus\n\nmapgpus is poyjpus\n\npoyjpus is kutypus\n\nkutypus is bopbpus\n\nbopbpus is cunppus\n\ncunppus is yuztpus\n\nyuztpus is pudcpus\n\npudcpus is ditfpus\n\nditfpus is nicxpus\n\nnicxpus is rinxpus\n\nrinxpus is mewxpus\n\nmewxpus is bormpus\n\nbormpus is vomkpus\n\nvomkpus is lirtpus\n\nlirtpus is vuxnpus\n\nvuxnpus is wuxcpus\n\nwuxcpus is kastpus\n\nkastpus is babgpus\n\nSo, yes, yafppus belongs to babgpus.\n\nThus, x is babgpus.\n\nTherefore, the OR statement is true.\n\nSo, the answer is true.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, the answer is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

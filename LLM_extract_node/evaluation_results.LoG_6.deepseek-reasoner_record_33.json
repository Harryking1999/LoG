But I don't think jaxspus is relevant here, so I'll focus on caympus.\n\n- caympus is gizgpus.\n\n- gizgpus is tuwgpus.\n\n- tuwgpus is hiwypus.\n\n- hiwypus is zivtpus.\n\n- zivtpus is zatcpus.\n\n- zatcpus is mebmpus.\n\n- mebmpus is qusrpus.\n\n- qusrpus is renlpus.\n\n- renlpus is babrpus and tupcpus and hegrpus and qurypus.\n\nSo, from this chain, x is caympus, which leads to gizgpus, then tuwgpus, then hiwypus, then zivtpus, then zatcpus, then mebmpus, then qusrpus, then renlpus, and renlpus includes babrpus. Therefore, x is babrpus because it belongs to renlpus through this chain.\n\nNow, I need to check if x is babgpus.

Therefore, x is babspus because it belongs to lutgpus, which leads to babspus.\n\nBut I need babgpus as well.

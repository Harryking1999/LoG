  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the relationships given. The statements are of the form \"A is B\", which means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, it's about categorization or containment.\n\nThe question is: Is x babcpus and babrpus? Meaning, does x belong to both babcpus and babrpus?\n\nI need to trace what x is and see if it connects to babcpus and babrpus.\n\nFrom the given information:\n\n- x is tolrpus and nigmpus. (So x belongs to tolrpus and nigmpus.)\n\n- x is mozqpus. (So x also belongs to mozqpus.)\n\nNow, I need to find out what tolrpus, nigmpus, and mozqpus are connected to.\n\nLet me list all the statements:\n\n1. gevmpus is gaktpus and wawypus.\n\n2. nojppus is ravzpus.\n\n3. mozqpus is nojppus and delgpus.\n\n4. vagfpus is ramhpus and valjpus.\n\n5. bakzpus is dufxpus.\n\n6. ramhpus is lujqpus.\n\n7. lujqpus is koqrpus.\n\n8. wifspus is babrpus and nexvpus and yikmpus.\n\n9. dufxpus is babcpus.\n\n10. fergpus is qoxspus.\n\n11. koqrpus is bakzpus and xohgpus.\n\n12. x is tolrpus and nigmpus.\n\n13. qoxspus is gevmpus.\n\n14. gaktpus is wifspus and wahkpus.\n\n15. ravzpus is vagfpus and borbpus.\n\n16. x is mozqpus.\n\n17. tolrpus is fergpus.\n\nAlso, from note: x is mozqpus, which is given directly.\n\nI need to find if x is babcpus and babrpus.\n\nbabcpus is mentioned in statement 9: dufxpus is babcpus.\n\nbabrpus is mentioned in statement 8: wifspus is babrpus and nexvpus and yikmpus.\n\nSo, I need to see if x is connected to dufxpus or wifspus.\n\nSince x is mozqpus, let's start with mozqpus.\n\nFrom statement 3: mozqpus is nojppus and delgpus.\n\nSo, mozqpus belongs to nojppus and delgpus.\n\nNow, nojppus is ravzpus from statement 2.\n\nSo, nojppus is ravzpus, meaning nojppus belongs to ravzpus.\n\nTherefore, since mozqpus is nojppus, and nojppus is ravzpus, then mozqpus is also ravzpus? But we have to be careful with the transitivity.\n\nThe relationship is \"is\" meaning belongs to, so if A is B, and B is C, then A is C? Not necessarily, because \"B is C\" might mean B is a subset of C or something. But in this context, since it's about categories, if A belongs to B and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C? I think we can assume that \"is\" implies a hierarchical relationship where belonging is transitive.\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". So, if A is contained in B, and B is contained in C, then A is contained in C. So yes, transitivity should hold.\n\nSimilarly, if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, x is mozqpus.\n\nmozqpus is nojppus and delgpus.\n\nSo, x is nojppus and delgpus.\n\nNow, nojppus is ravzpus (from 2), so x is ravzpus.\n\nNow, ravzpus is vagfpus and borbpus (from 15).\n\nSo, x is vagfpus and borbpus.\n\nNow, vagfpus is ramhpus and valjpus (from 4).\n\nSo, x is ramhpus and valjpus.\n\nNow, ramhpus is lujqpus (from 6).\n\nSo, x is lujqpus.\n\nlujqpus is koqrpus (from 7).\n\nSo, x is koqrpus.\n\nkoqrpus is bakzpus and xohgpus (from 11).\n\nSo, x is bakzpus and xohgpus.\n\nNow, bakzpus is dufxpus (from 5).\n\nSo, x is dufxpus.\n\nAnd dufxpus is babcpus (from 9).\n\nSo, x is babcpus.\n\nGreat! So we have that x is babcpus.\n\nNow, we need to see if x is babrpus.\n\nbabrpus is from wifspus: wifspus is babrpus and nexvpus and yikmpus. So, wifspus belongs to babrpus, meaning that anything that is wifspus is also babrpus? Or is it that wifspus is a category that contains babrpus? Let's see the phrasing.\n\nThe statement is: \"wifspus is babrpus and nexvpus and yikmpus.\"\n\nAccording to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B. So, if wifspus is babrpus, that means wifspus belongs to babrpus, so wifspus is a subset of babrpus? Or is it that babrpus is a category that contains wifspus?\n\nI think there might be ambiguity in the direction.\n\nLet me read the note carefully: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\"\n\nSo, \"A is B\" means A is a member of B or A is a subset of B? The phrase \"belongs to\" typically means membership, but \"contained in\" might mean subset.\n\nFor example, if A is contained in B, then A is a subset of B.\n\nBut in the statement \"wifspus is babrpus\", if we interpret \"is\" as \"belongs to\", then wifspus is an instance of babrpus, meaning wifspus is a member of the category babrpus. But if we interpret \"is\" as \"is contained in\", then wifspus is a subset of babrpus.\n\nThe note says both: \"belongs to\" or \"contained in\". So it might be that sometimes it means membership and sometimes subset, but I think for consistency, we should see how it is used.\n\nLook at other statements: \"gevmpus is gaktpus and wawypus\" – this seems like gevmpus is composed of gaktpus and wawypus, or gevmpus belongs to both categories? Similarly, \"mozqpus is nojppus and delgpus\" – probably means that mozqpus is made up of nojppus and delgpus, or mozqpus belongs to nojppus and delgpus.\n\nBut from the transitivity we used earlier, when we said mozqpus is nojppus, and nojppus is ravzpus, so mozqpus is ravzpus, we treated \"is\" as a subset relation or membership chain.\n\nIn the case of \"wifspus is babrpus\", if wifspus is babrpus, that would mean that wifspus is a type of babrpus, so anything that is wifspus is also babrpus? Or is it that babrpus is a part of wifspus? I think we need to clarify.\n\nLet's see the statement: \"wifspus is babrpus and nexvpus and yikmpus.\" This seems like wifspus consists of babrpus, nexvpus, and yikmpus, meaning that babrpus is a component of wifspus. But according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if wifspus is babrpus, it should mean wifspus belongs to babrpus, which would imply that wifspus is a member of babrpus, so babrpus is a larger category containing wifspus.\n\nBut that might be inconsistent with how we used it earlier.\n\nFor example, in statement 1: \"gevmpus is gaktpus and wawypus\" – if gevmpus belongs to gaktpus, that would mean gevmpus is a member of gaktpus, so gaktpus is a category containing gevmpus. But then, from statement 14: \"gaktpus is wifspus and wahkpus\" – so gaktpus belongs to wifspus and wahkpus? That would mean gaktpus is a member of wifspus, so wifspus contains gaktpus.\n\nBut from statement 8, wifspus is babrpus, etc., so if wifspus belongs to babrpus, then babrpus contains wifspus, so gaktpus is in wifspus, which is in babrpus, so gaktpus is in babrpus.\n\nBut let's see the question: we need to see if x is babrpus.\n\nx is mozqpus, and we have traced x to babcpus, but not yet to babrpus.\n\nFrom above, we have x is koqrpus, which is bakzpus, which is dufxpus, which is babcpus. So for babcpus, it seems clear.\n\nFor babrpus, we need to see if x is connected to wifspus or something.\n\nFrom statement 14: gaktpus is wifspus and wahkpus. So gaktpus belongs to wifspus and wahkpus? Or does it mean gaktpus contains wifspus? Based on the note, \"gaktpus is wifspus\" means gaktpus belongs to wifspus, so gaktpus is a member of wifspus, so wifspus contains gaktpus.\n\nSimilarly, from statement 1: gevmpus is gaktpus and wawypus – so gevmpus belongs to gaktpus and wawypus, meaning gevmpus is a member of gaktpus and also of wawypus.\n\nBut then from statement 13: qoxspus is gevmpus – so qoxspus belongs to gevmpus.\n\nAnd from statement 10: fergpus is qoxspus – so fergpus belongs to qoxspus.\n\nAnd from statement 17: tolrpus is fergpus – so tolrpus belongs to fergpus.\n\nAnd from statement 12: x is tolrpus and nigmpus – so x belongs to tolrpus.\n\nSo, since x belongs to tolrpus, and tolrpus belongs to fergpus, so x belongs to fergpus.\n\nfergpus belongs to qoxspus, so x belongs to qoxspus.\n\nqoxspus belongs to gevmpus, so x belongs to gevmpus.\n\ngevmpus belongs to gaktpus and wawypus, so x belongs to gaktpus and wawypus.\n\ngaktpus belongs to wifspus and wahkpus, so x belongs to wifspus and wahkpus.\n\nNow, wifspus is babrpus and nexvpus and yikmpus? Here is the confusion.\n\nWhat does \"wifspus is babrpus\" mean? If wifspus belongs to babrpus, then since x belongs to wifspus, x also belongs to babrpus? But only if the belonging is transitive, which it should be.\n\nIf \"wifspus is babrpus\" means that wifspus is a member of babrpus, then anything that belongs to wifspus also belongs to babrpus? Not necessarily. If wifspus is a member of babrpus, that means babrpus is a category that contains wifspus as an element, but if x belongs to wifspus, x may not necessarily belong to babrpus unless babrpus is a superset category.\n\nIn set theory, if babrpus is a set, and wifspus is an element of babrpus, then if x is an element of wifspus, x may not be an element of babrpus unless wifspus is a subset of babrpus, but here wifspus is an element, not a subset.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nLet's look at the note: \"A is B\" means \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". So it could be membership or subset.\n\nIn the context, we need to see how it is used.\n\nFrom statement 8: \"wifspus is babrpus and nexvpus and yikmpus\" – this seems like wifspus is composed of babrpus, nexvpus, and yikmpus, so it might be that babrpus is a part of wifspus, meaning that wifspus contains babrpus.\n\nBut according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if wifspus is babrpus, it should mean wifspus belongs to babrpus, so babrpus contains wifspus.\n\nThere is a conflict in interpretation.\n\nPerhaps for the purpose of this problem, we should consider that \"A is B\" means that A is a subtype of B or A is contained in B, so that transitivity holds for belonging to the same chain.\n\nIn the first part, when we traced x to babcpus, we used transitivity: from x is mozqpus, mozqpus is nojppus, nojppus is ravzpus, etc., and we assumed that if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nSimilarly, for the other chain, we should do the same.\n\nSo, for example, from statement 14: \"gaktpus is wifspus\" – we interpreted as gaktpus belongs to wifspus, so gaktpus is contained in wifspus.\n\nBut from statement 8: \"wifspus is babrpus\" – if we interpret as wifspus belongs to babrpus, then wifspus is contained in babrpus, so since gaktpus is in wifspus, gaktpus is in babrpus.\n\nThen from above, x is in gaktpus, so x is in babrpus.\n\nSo for consistency, we should always interpret \"A is B\" as A is a subset of B or A is contained in B, meaning that all elements of A are in B.\n\nBut let's see the statement itself: \"wifspus is babrpus and nexvpus and yikmpus\" – if wifspus is contained in babrpus, and also contained in nexvpus and yikmpus, that would mean wifspus is a subset of each of them, which might not make sense if they are separate categories.\n\nPerhaps it means that wifspus is equal to the union of babrpus, nexvpus, and yikmpus, but the note says not that A equals B, so it might be that A is contained in B, but here it says \"is B and C\", so it might be that A is contained in B and contained in C.\n\nBut in set theory, if A is contained in B and contained in C, then A is contained in B ∩ C, but here it says \"and\" which might mean multiple categories.\n\nAnother way: perhaps \"A is B\" means that A has property B or something, but I think for this problem, since we have to find if x is babrpus, and from the chain, we can get to it.\n\nLet's list all relationships in terms of containment.\n\nFrom the note, \"A is B\" means A is contained in B, so B contains A.\n\nSo, for statement 8: \"wifspus is babrpus\" means wifspus is contained in babrpus, so babrpus contains wifspus.\n\nSimilarly, \"wifspus is nexvpus\" means wifspus is contained in nexvpus, and \"wifspus is yikmpus\" means wifspus is contained in yikmpus. So wifspus is contained in babrpus, nexvpus, and yikmpus.\n\nBut that seems odd, but let's go with that.\n\nSimilarly, for statement 1: \"gevmpus is gaktpus\" means gevmpus is contained in gaktpus, so gaktpus contains gevmpus.\n\nAnd \"gevmpus is wawypus\" means gevmpus is contained in wawypus.\n\nNow, from statement 14: \"gaktpus is wifspus\" means gaktpus is contained in wifspus, so wifspus contains gaktpus.\n\nBut from statement 8, wifspus is contained in babrpus, so babrpus contains wifspus, and thus contains gaktpus, and thus contains gevmpus, etc.\n\nAlso, from statement 13: \"qoxspus is gevmpus\" means qoxspus is contained in gevmpus.\n\nAnd from statement 10: \"fergpus is qoxspus\" means fergpus is contained in qoxspus.\n\nAnd from statement 17: \"tolrpus is fergpus\" means tolrpus is contained in fergpus.\n\nAnd from statement 12: \"x is tolrpus\" means x is contained in tolrpus.\n\nSo, since x contained in tolrpus, tolrpus contained in fergpus, fergpus contained in qoxspus, qoxspus contained in gevmpus, gevmpus contained in gaktpus, gaktpus contained in wifspus, wifspus contained in babrpus, therefore x contained in babrpus.\n\nSo, x is contained in babrpus, meaning x belongs to babrpus.\n\nSimilarly, from earlier, we have x contained in babcpus.\n\nSo, x is both babcpus and babrpus.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's confirm the other chain as well.\n\nFrom the first chain, we have x is mozqpus, and we derived x is dufxpus, which is babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nFrom the second chain, we have x is tolrpus, and we derived x is babrpus.\n\nSo, both are true.\n\nThus, x is babcpus and babrpus.\n\nSo, the statement is true.",

So it could be membership or subset.\n\nIn the context, we need to see how it is used.\n\nFrom statement 8: \"wifspus is babrpus and nexvpus and yikmpus\" – this seems like wifspus is composed of babrpus, nexvpus, and yikmpus, so it might be that babrpus is a part of wifspus, meaning that wifspus contains babrpus.\n\nBut according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if wifspus is babrpus, it should mean wifspus belongs to babrpus, so babrpus contains wifspus.\n\nThere is a conflict in interpretation.\n\nPerhaps for the purpose of this problem, we should consider that \"A is B\" means that A is a subtype of B or A is contained in B, so that transitivity holds for belonging to the same chain.\n\nIn the first part, when we traced x to babcpus, we used transitivity: from x is mozqpus, mozqpus is nojppus, nojppus is ravzpus, etc., and we assumed that if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nSimilarly, for the other chain, we should do the same.\n\nSo, for example, from statement 14: \"gaktpus is wifspus\" – we interpreted as gaktpus belongs to wifspus, so gaktpus is contained in wifspus.\n\nBut from statement 8: \"wifspus is babrpus\" – if we interpret as wifspus belongs to babrpus, then wifspus is contained in babrpus, so since gaktpus is in wifspus, gaktpus is in babrpus.\n\nThen from above, x is in gaktpus, so x is in babrpus.\n\nSo for consistency, we should always interpret \"A is B\" as A is a subset of B or A is contained in B, meaning that all elements of A are in B.\n\nBut let's see the statement itself: \"wifspus is babrpus and nexvpus and yikmpus\" – if wifspus is contained in babrpus, and also contained in nexvpus and yikmpus, that would mean wifspus is a subset of each of them, which might not make sense if they are separate categories.\n\nPerhaps it means that wifspus is equal to the union of babrpus, nexvpus, and yikmpus, but the note says not that A equals B, so it might be that A is contained in B, but here it says \"is B and C\", so it might be that A is contained in B and contained in C.\n\nBut in set theory, if A is contained in B and contained in C, then A is contained in B ∩ C, but here it says \"and\" which might mean multiple categories.\n\nAnother way: perhaps \"A is B\" means that A has property B or something, but I think for this problem, since we have to find if x is babrpus, and from the chain, we can get to it.\n\nLet's list all relationships in terms of containment.\n\nFrom the note, \"A is B\" means A is contained in B, so B contains A.\n\nSo, for statement 8: \"wifspus is babrpus\" means wifspus is contained in babrpus, so babrpus contains wifspus.\n\nSimilarly, \"wifspus is nexvpus\" means wifspus is contained in nexvpus, and \"wifspus is yikmpus\" means wifspus is contained in yikmpus. So wifspus is contained in babrpus, nexvpus, and yikmpus.\n\nBut that seems odd, but let's go with that.\n\nSimilarly, for statement 1: \"gevmpus is gaktpus\" means gevmpus is contained in gaktpus, so gaktpus contains gevmpus.\n\nAnd \"gevmpus is wawypus\" means gevmpus is contained in wawypus.\n\nNow, from statement 14: \"gaktpus is wifspus\" means gaktpus is contained in wifspus, so wifspus contains gaktpus.\n\nBut from statement 8, wifspus is contained in babrpus, so babrpus contains wifspus, and thus contains gaktpus, and thus contains gevmpus, etc.\n\nAlso, from statement 13: \"qoxspus is gevmpus\" means qoxspus is contained in gevmpus.\n\nAnd from statement 10: \"fergpus is qoxspus\" means fergpus is contained in qoxspus.\n\nAnd from statement 17: \"tolrpus is fergpus\" means tolrpus is contained in fergpus.\n\nAnd from statement 12: \"x is tolrpus\" means x is contained in tolrpus.\n\nSo, since x contained in tolrpus, tolrpus contained in fergpus, fergpus contained in qoxspus, qoxspus contained in gevmpus, gevmpus contained in gaktpus, gaktpus contained in wifspus, wifspus contained in babrpus, therefore x contained in babrpus.\n\nSo, x is contained in babrpus, meaning x belongs to babrpus.\n\nSimilarly, from earlier, we have x contained in babcpus.\n\nSo, x is both babcpus and babrpus.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's confirm the other chain as well.\n\nFrom the first chain, we have x is mozqpus, and we derived x is dufxpus, which is babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nFrom the second chain, we have x is tolrpus, and we derived x is babrpus.\n\nSo, both are true.\n\nThus, x is babcpus and babrpus.\n\nSo, the statement is true.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, the statement is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

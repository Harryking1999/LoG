  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is both babgpus and babrpus. From the given information, I see that x is defined as johmpus and dacxpus. So, x is a combination of johmpus and dacxpus.\n\nNow, I need to find out what johmpus and dacxpus are, and specifically if they lead to babgpus and babrpus.\n\nLet me list out all the relationships from the given information:\n\n1. tixypus is maldpus.\n\n2. tulppus is sukbpus.\n\n3. hiknpus is yectpus and poyrpus.\n\n4. johmpus is qebgpus.\n\n5. yijwpus is hiknpus and fufjpus.\n\n6. moxwpus is wizvpus and palbpus.\n\n7. bitjpus is yijwpus and jotzpus.\n\n8. qemtpus is lorkpus.\n\n9. tixypus is babrpus and pubwpus.  // So tixypus is both babrpus and pubwpus.\n\n10. yurxpus is tulppus.\n\n11. maldpus is jubbpus.\n\n12. lorkpus is moxwpus and qoyzpus and havtpus.\n\n13. kilxpus is vemspus.\n\n14. tixypus is babgpus and jabfpus.  // So tixypus is also babgpus and jabfpus.\n\n15. sukbpus is bitjpus.\n\n16. wizvpus is lefzpus and fobzpus.\n\n17. lekqpus is kilxpus.\n\n18. lefzpus is lekqpus and junvpus.\n\n19. yectpus is qemtpus.\n\n20. x is johmpus and dacxpus.  // This is about x.\n\n21. fuxspus is dakkpus.\n\n22. lefzpus is fuxspus.  // But from 16, lefzpus is also lefzpus and fobzpus? No, 16 says wizvpus is lefzpus and fobzpus, so wizvpus contains lefzpus and fobzpus.\n\n23. johmpus is yurxpus.  // From the end: johmpus is yurxpus.\n\nAlso, vemspus is tixypus and turtpus.\n\nNow, I need to focus on x. x is johmpus and dacxpus.\n\nBut I don't see dacxpus mentioned anywhere else. Let me check all the points. In point 20, x is johmpus and dacxpus, but dacxpus isn't defined in any other statement. That might be a problem.\n\nPerhaps dacxpus is a typo or I missed it. Let me read carefully.\n\nIn the list, I have: x is johmpus and dacxpus. But in the other statements, I don't see dacxpus. I see dakkpus in point 21: fuxspus is dakkpus. But that's dakkpus, not dacxpus.\n\nMaybe it's a mistake, or perhaps dacxpus is not defined. But I need to find if x is babgpus and babrpus.\n\nbabgpus and babrpus are both associated with tixypus. From point 9, tixypus is babrpus and pubwpus. From point 14, tixypus is babgpus and jabfpus. So tixypus is both babgpus and babrpus.\n\nBut x is johmpus and dacxpus, so I need to see if johmpus is related to tixypus or directly to babgpus and babrpus.\n\nLet me trace johmpus.\n\nFrom point 4: johmpus is qebgpus. But qebgpus isn't mentioned elsewhere, so that might not help.\n\nFrom point 23: johmpus is yurxpus. So johmpus is yurxpus.\n\nNow, yurxpus is from point 10: yurxpus is tulppus. So yurxpus is tulppus.\n\nTherefore, johmpus is yurxpus which is tulppus.\n\nNow, tulppus is from point 2: tulppus is sukbpus. So tulppus is sukbpus.\n\nTherefore, johmpus is sukbpus.\n\nNow, sukbpus is from point 15: sukbpus is bitjpus. So sukbpus is bitjpus.\n\nTherefore, johmpus is bitjpus.\n\nNow, bitjpus is from point 7: bitjpus is yijwpus and jotzpus. So bitjpus contains yijwpus and jotzpus.\n\nBut since johmpus is bitjpus, it means johmpus contains yijwpus and jotzpus? Or is it that johmpus is a type of bitjpus? In this context, \"is\" means belongs to category or contained in, so johmpus is contained in bitjpus.\n\nSimilarly, we need to see if johmpus leads to tixypus or to babgpus/babrpus.\n\nNow, yijwpus is from point 5: yijwpus is hiknpus and fufjpus.\n\nAnd hiknpus is from point 3: hiknpus is yectpus and poyrpus.\n\nyectpus is from point 19: yectpus is qemtpus.\n\nqemtpus is from point 8: qemtpus is lorkpus.\n\nlorkpus is from point 12: lorkpus is moxwpus and qoyzpus and havtpus.\n\nmoxwpus is from point 6: moxwpus is wizvpus and palbpus.\n\nwizvpus is from point 16: wizvpus is lefzpus and fobzpus.\n\nlefzpus is from point 18: lefzpus is lekqpus and junvpus.\n\nAlso from point 22: lefzpus is fuxspus? Point 22 says lefzpus is fuxspus? Let's see: in the given information, it says \"lefzpus is fuxspus\" but from point 16, wizvpus is lefzpus and fobzpus, so lefzpus is contained in wizvpus, but point 22 says lefzpus is fuxspus? That might be confusing.\n\nLet's list all points where lefzpus is mentioned.\n\nFrom point 16: wizvpus is lefzpus and fobzpus. So lefzpus is part of wizvpus.\n\nFrom point 18: lefzpus is lekqpus and junvpus. So lefzpus contains lekqpus and junvpus.\n\nFrom point 22: lefzpus is fuxspus. So lefzpus is also fuxspus.\n\nBut fuxspus is from point 21: fuxspus is dakkpus. So fuxspus is dakkpus.\n\nTherefore, lefzpus is fuxspus which is dakkpus.\n\nBut also, lefzpus is lekqpus and junvpus.\n\nNow, lekqpus is from point 17: lekqpus is kilxpus.\n\nkilxpus is from point 13: kilxpus is vemspus.\n\nvemspus is from the end: vemspus is tixypus and turtpus.\n\nSo vemspus is tixypus and turtpus.\n\nTherefore, kilxpus is vemspus which is tixypus and turtpus.\n\nSo lekqpus is kilxpus which is vemspus which is tixypus and turtpus.\n\nThus, since lefzpus is lekqpus and junvpus, lefzpus contains lekqpus, which contains tixypus.\n\nSo through this chain, lefzpus is connected to tixypus.\n\nBut we have johmpus, which we traced to bitjpus, which contains yijwpus, which contains hiknpus, which contains yectpus, which is qemtpus, which is lorkpus, which contains moxwpus, which contains wizvpus, which contains lefzpus, which contains lekqpus, which contains kilxpus, which contains vemspus, which contains tixypus.\n\nSo eventually, johmpus is connected to tixypus through a long chain.\n\nSince tixypus is babgpus and babrpus, then if johmpus is contained in tixypus, then johmpus would be babgpus and babrpus.\n\nBut is johmpus contained in tixypus? From the chain, it seems that johmpus is part of bitjpus, which is part of sukbpus, which is part of tulppus, which is part of yurxpus, which is part of johmpus? Wait, no: we have johmpus is yurxpus, which is tulppus, which is sukbpus, which is bitjpus, so johmpus is contained in bitjpus.\n\nThen bitjpus contains yijwpus, which contains hiknpus, etc., down to tixypus.\n\nSo johmpus is contained in a category that eventually contains tixypus. But does that mean johmpus is contained in tixypus? Not necessarily. The containment might be upward or downward.\n\nIn this context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so B is a broader category that includes A. So if A is B, then A is contained in B.\n\nSo from the chain, we have:\n\njohmpus is yurxpus → so johmpus ⊂ yurxpus\n\nyurxpus is tulppus → so yurxpus ⊂ tulppus\n\ntulppus is sukbpus → so tulppus ⊂ sukbpus\n\nsukbpus is bitjpus → so sukbpus ⊂ bitjpus\n\nbitjpus is yijwpus and jotzpus → so bitjpus ⊂ yijwpus and bitjpus ⊂ jotzpus? No, careful: \"bitjpus is yijwpus and jotzpus\" means that bitjpus belongs to yijwpus and also to jotzpus? Or does it mean that bitjpus contains yijwpus and jotzpus?\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So if A is B, then A is contained in B, meaning B is a superset containing A.\n\nBut in the case of \"bitjpus is yijwpus and jotzpus\", it might mean that bitjpus is contained in yijwpus and also contained in jotzpus? Or does it mean that bitjpus is composed of yijwpus and jotzpus? The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so it should be A ⊂ B.\n\nBut here \"bitjpus is yijwpus and jotzpus\" – this seems like bitjpus is both yijwpus and jotzpus, meaning bitjpus ⊂ yijwpus and bitjpus ⊂ jotzpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"hiknpus is yectpus and poyrpus\" means hiknpus ⊂ yectpus and hiknpus ⊂ poyrpus.\n\nBut that would imply that hiknpus is contained in yectpus, which is contained in qemtpus, etc.\n\nBut let's see the vemspus example: vemspus is tixypus and turtpus, so vemspus ⊂ tixypus and vemspus ⊂ turtpus.\n\nBut from point 14, tixypus is babgpus and jabfpus, so tixypus ⊂ babgpus and tixypus ⊂ jabfpus.\n\nSimilarly, from point 9, tixypus is babrpus and pubwpus, so tixypus ⊂ babrpus and tixypus ⊂ pubwpus.\n\nSo for tixypus, it is contained in babgpus and contained in babrpus.\n\nNow for johmpus, we want to know if it is contained in babgpus and babrpus, which means we need to see if johmpus is contained in tixypus or in something that is contained in babgpus/babrpus.\n\nFrom the chain, we have johmpus ⊂ yurxpus ⊂ tulppus ⊂ sukbpus ⊂ bitjpus.\n\nNow bitjpus is yijwpus and jotzpus, so bitjpus ⊂ yijwpus and bitjpus ⊂ jotzpus.\n\nSo johmpus ⊂ bitjpus ⊂ yijwpus.\n\nyijwpus is hiknpus and fufjpus, so yijwpus ⊂ hiknpus and yijwpus ⊂ fufjpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ yijwpus ⊂ hiknpus.\n\nhiknpus is yectpus and poyrpus, so hiknpus ⊂ yectpus and hiknpus ⊂ poyrpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ hiknpus ⊂ yectpus.\n\nyectpus is qemtpus, so yectpus ⊂ qemtpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ yectpus ⊂ qemtpus.\n\nqemtpus is lorkpus, so qemtpus ⊂ lorkpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ qemtpus ⊂ lorkpus.\n\nlorkpus is moxwpus and qoyzpus and havtpus, so lorkpus ⊂ moxwpus and lorkpus ⊂ qoyzpus and lorkpus ⊂ havtpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ lorkpus ⊂ moxwpus.\n\nmoxwpus is wizvpus and palbpus, so moxwpus ⊂ wizvpus and moxwpus ⊂ palbpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ moxwpus ⊂ wizvpus.\n\nwizvpus is lefzpus and fobzpus, so wizvpus ⊂ lefzpus and wizvpus ⊂ fobzpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ wizvpus ⊂ lefzpus.\n\nlefzpus is lekqpus and junvpus, so lefzpus ⊂ lekqpus and lefzpus ⊂ junvpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ lefzpus ⊂ lekqpus.\n\nlekqpus is kilxpus, so lekqpus ⊂ kilxpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ lekqpus ⊂ kilxpus.\n\nkilxpus is vemspus, so kilxpus ⊂ vemspus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ kilxpus ⊂ vemspus.\n\nvemspus is tixypus and turtpus, so vemspus ⊂ tixypus and vemspus ⊂ turtpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ vemspus ⊂ tixypus.\n\nTherefore, johmpus is contained in tixypus.\n\nSince tixypus is contained in babgpus and contained in babrpus, then johmpus is also contained in babgpus and contained in babrpus.\n\nSo johmpus is babgpus and babrpus.\n\nBut x is johmpus and dacxpus. What about dacxpus? We don't have any information about dacxpus. From the given information, dacxpus is only mentioned in the definition of x: x is johmpus and dacxpus.\n\nThis might mean that x is composed of johmpus and dacxpus, or that x belongs to both johmpus and dacxpus.\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B.\n\nSo for x is johmpus and dacxpus, it means that x is contained in johmpus and x is contained in dacxpus.\n\nSince x is contained in johmpus, and we have that johmpus is contained in babgpus and babrpus, then x must also be contained in babgpus and babrpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus and babrpus.\n\nBut the question is: x is babgpus and babrpus? So it should be true.\n\nBut we need to confirm if dacxpus affects this. Since x is contained in johmpus, and johmpus is babgpus and babrpus, then x should be babgpus and babrpus regardless of dacxpus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's make sure there is no contradiction or missing information.\n\nWe also have that x is dacxpus, but since we don't know what dacxpus is, it doesn't affect the containment in babgpus and babrpus through johmpus.\n\nTherefore, it is true.\n\nSo for the question: Is it true that x is babgpus and babrpus? Yes.\n\nThus, the answer is true.",

The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so it should be A ⊂ B.\n\nBut here \"bitjpus is yijwpus and jotzpus\" – this seems like bitjpus is both yijwpus and jotzpus, meaning bitjpus ⊂ yijwpus and bitjpus ⊂ jotzpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"hiknpus is yectpus and poyrpus\" means hiknpus ⊂ yectpus and hiknpus ⊂ poyrpus.\n\nBut that would imply that hiknpus is contained in yectpus, which is contained in qemtpus, etc.\n\nBut let's see the vemspus example: vemspus is tixypus and turtpus, so vemspus ⊂ tixypus and vemspus ⊂ turtpus.\n\nBut from point 14, tixypus is babgpus and jabfpus, so tixypus ⊂ babgpus and tixypus ⊂ jabfpus.\n\nSimilarly, from point 9, tixypus is babrpus and pubwpus, so tixypus ⊂ babrpus and tixypus ⊂ pubwpus.\n\nSo for tixypus, it is contained in babgpus and contained in babrpus.\n\nNow for johmpus, we want to know if it is contained in babgpus and babrpus, which means we need to see if johmpus is contained in tixypus or in something that is contained in babgpus/babrpus.\n\nFrom the chain, we have johmpus ⊂ yurxpus ⊂ tulppus ⊂ sukbpus ⊂ bitjpus.\n\nNow bitjpus is yijwpus and jotzpus, so bitjpus ⊂ yijwpus and bitjpus ⊂ jotzpus.\n\nSo johmpus ⊂ bitjpus ⊂ yijwpus.\n\nyijwpus is hiknpus and fufjpus, so yijwpus ⊂ hiknpus and yijwpus ⊂ fufjpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ yijwpus ⊂ hiknpus.\n\nhiknpus is yectpus and poyrpus, so hiknpus ⊂ yectpus and hiknpus ⊂ poyrpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ hiknpus ⊂ yectpus.\n\nyectpus is qemtpus, so yectpus ⊂ qemtpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ yectpus ⊂ qemtpus.\n\nqemtpus is lorkpus, so qemtpus ⊂ lorkpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ qemtpus ⊂ lorkpus.\n\nlorkpus is moxwpus and qoyzpus and havtpus, so lorkpus ⊂ moxwpus and lorkpus ⊂ qoyzpus and lorkpus ⊂ havtpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ lorkpus ⊂ moxwpus.\n\nmoxwpus is wizvpus and palbpus, so moxwpus ⊂ wizvpus and moxwpus ⊂ palbpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ moxwpus ⊂ wizvpus.\n\nwizvpus is lefzpus and fobzpus, so wizvpus ⊂ lefzpus and wizvpus ⊂ fobzpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ wizvpus ⊂ lefzpus.\n\nlefzpus is lekqpus and junvpus, so lefzpus ⊂ lekqpus and lefzpus ⊂ junvpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ lefzpus ⊂ lekqpus.\n\nlekqpus is kilxpus, so lekqpus ⊂ kilxpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ lekqpus ⊂ kilxpus.\n\nkilxpus is vemspus, so kilxpus ⊂ vemspus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ kilxpus ⊂ vemspus.\n\nvemspus is tixypus and turtpus, so vemspus ⊂ tixypus and vemspus ⊂ turtpus.\n\nThus johmpus ⊂ vemspus ⊂ tixypus.\n\nTherefore, johmpus is contained in tixypus.\n\nSince tixypus is contained in babgpus and contained in babrpus, then johmpus is also contained in babgpus and contained in babrpus.\n\nSo johmpus is babgpus and babrpus.\n\nBut x is johmpus and dacxpus. What about dacxpus? We don't have any information about dacxpus. From the given information, dacxpus is only mentioned in the definition of x: x is johmpus and dacxpus.\n\nThis might mean that x is composed of johmpus and dacxpus, or that x belongs to both johmpus and dacxpus.\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B.\n\nSo for x is johmpus and dacxpus, it means that x is contained in johmpus and x is contained in dacxpus.\n\nSince x is contained in johmpus, and we have that johmpus is contained in babgpus and babrpus, then x must also be contained in babgpus and babrpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus and babrpus.\n\nBut the question is: x is babgpus and babrpus? So it should be true.\n\nBut we need to confirm if dacxpus affects this. Since x is contained in johmpus, and johmpus is babgpus and babrpus, then x should be babgpus and babrpus regardless of dacxpus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's make sure there is no contradiction or missing information.\n\nWe also have that x is dacxpus, but since we don't know what dacxpus is, it doesn't affect the containment in babgpus and babrpus through johmpus.\n\nTherefore, it is true.\n\nSo for the question: Is it true that x is babgpus and babrpus? Yes.\n\nThus, the answer is true.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nThus, the answer is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

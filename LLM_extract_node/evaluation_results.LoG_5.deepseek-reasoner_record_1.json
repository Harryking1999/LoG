  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the relationships. The statements are of the form \"A is B\", which means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, it's a hierarchical or categorical relationship.\n\nI need to find out if x is babcpus. That means I need to see if x belongs to the category babcpus, either directly or through a chain of relationships.\n\nLet me list out all the given statements:\n\n1. puwppus is babcpus.\n\n2. xifwpus is jupkpus.\n\n3. noshpus is neccpus and nuprpus. (This means noshpus belongs to both neccpus and nuprpus? Or is it that neccpus and nuprpus are categories for noshpus? I think \"A is B and C\" means A belongs to B and also to C. So noshpus is in neccpus and in nuprpus.)\n\n4. lincpus is mumhpus.\n\n5. pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus. (So pecypus belongs to xifwpus and to nabbpus.)\n\n6. toxkpus is lincpus and vaskpus.\n\n7. waxqpus is jivbpus and vevlpus.\n\n8. jivbpus is toxkpus.\n\n9. mumhpus is sesxpus and puqypus.\n\n10. givwpus is razbpus.\n\n11. x is waxqpus and texwpus. (So x belongs to waxqpus and to texwpus.)\n\n12. qobmpus is noshpus and yixmpus.\n\n13. xikdpus is puwppus.\n\n14. sesxpus is qobmpus.\n\n15. neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus. (neccpus belongs to givwpus, humypus, and dalbpus? That seems odd. Usually, we think of smaller things belonging to larger categories. But here, it might be that neccpus is a category that contains givwpus, etc.? I need to clarify the direction.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, if A is B, then A is a subset of B or an instance of B. So, in terms of sets, B is a larger category that contains A.\n\nBut in statement 15, \"neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus\" – this would mean that neccpus belongs to givwpus, which implies neccpus is contained in givwpus, so givwpus is a larger category containing neccpus. Similarly, neccpus is contained in humypus and dalbpus. So givwpus, humypus, and dalbpus are all broader categories that include neccpus.\n\nSimilarly, in statement 3, \"noshpus is neccpus and nuprpus\" means noshpus is contained in both neccpus and nuprpus.\n\nNow, I need to find if x is babcpus. So, I need to see if x is contained in babcpus, either directly or through a chain.\n\nx is defined in statement 11: x is waxqpus and texwpus. So x belongs to waxqpus and to texwpus. But I need to connect to babcpus.\n\nbabcpus is mentioned in statement 1: puwppus is babcpus. So puwppus is contained in babcpus.\n\nAlso, from statement 13: xikdpus is puwppus. So xikdpus is contained in puwppus, and since puwppus is in babcpus, xikdpus is in babcpus.\n\nBut I need to get to x.\n\nLet me see if I can find a path from x to babcpus.\n\nx is in waxqpus. From statement 7: waxqpus is jivbpus and vevlpus. So waxqpus is contained in jivbpus and in vevlpus.\n\nFrom statement 8: jivbpus is toxkpus. So jivbpus is contained in toxkpus.\n\nFrom statement 6: toxkpus is lincpus and vaskpus. So toxkpus is contained in lincpus and in vaskpus.\n\nFrom statement 4: lincpus is mumhpus. So lincpus is contained in mumhpus.\n\nFrom statement 9: mumhpus is sesxpus and puqypus. So mumhpus is contained in sesxpus and in puqypus.\n\nFrom statement 14: sesxpus is qobmpus. So sesxpus is contained in qobmpus.\n\nFrom statement 12: qobmpus is noshpus and yixmpus. So qobmpus is contained in noshpus and in yixmpus.\n\nFrom statement 3: noshpus is neccpus and nuprpus. So noshpus is contained in neccpus and in nuprpus.\n\nFrom statement 15: neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus. So neccpus is contained in givwpus, humypus, and dalbpus.\n\nFrom statement 10: givwpus is razbpus. So givwpus is contained in razbpus.\n\nFrom statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus. But I have razbpus. From statement 10, givwpus is razbpus, and from 15, neccpus is givwpus, so neccpus is in razbpus.\n\nBut I need to get to babcpus. babcpus is related to puwppus.\n\nFrom statement 2: xifwpus is jupkpus.\n\nFrom statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is in xifwpus, and since xifwpus is jupkpus, pecypus is in jupkpus? Let's see.\n\nIf pecypus is xifwpus, that means pecypus is contained in xifwpus. And xifwpus is jupkpus, so xifwpus is contained in jupkpus. Therefore, pecypus is contained in jupkpus.\n\nBut from statement 10: givwpus is razbpus, and from statement 15, neccpus is givwpus, so neccpus is in razbpus.\n\nNow, from statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus. But I have razbpus. What is razbpus? From statement 10, givwpus is razbpus, but I need to connect razbpus to something else.\n\nFrom statement 15, neccpus is givwpus, so neccpus is in razbpus.\n\nBut from statement 3, noshpus is neccpus, so noshpus is in neccpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 12, qobmpus is noshpus, so qobmpus is in noshpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 14, sesxpus is qobmpus, so sesxpus is in qobmpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 9, mumhpus is sesxpus, so mumhpus is in sesxpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 4, lincpus is mumhpus, so lincpus is in mumhpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 6, toxkpus is lincpus, so toxkpus is in lincpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 8, jivbpus is toxkpus, so jivbpus is in toxkpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 7, waxqpus is jivbpus, so waxqpus is in jivbpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 11, x is waxqpus, so x is in waxqpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nSo x is in razbpus. But I need to see if x is in babcpus.\n\nrazbpus is from statement 10: givwpus is razbpus. But what is razbpus? Is razbpus related to babcpus?\n\nFrom statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus. But I have razbpus connected to pecypus? Let's see.\n\nFrom statement 10: givwpus is razbpus.\n\nFrom statement 15: neccpus is givwpus, so neccpus is in razbpus.\n\nBut from statement 3, noshpus is neccpus, so noshpus is in neccpus, so in razbpus.\n\nBut what about pecypus? pecypus is from statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus.\n\nIs there a connection between razbpus and pecypus?\n\nFrom statement 15, neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus. But neccpus is also a category that contains noshpus, etc.\n\nBut pecypus might be unrelated directly.\n\nFrom statement 2: xifwpus is jupkpus.\n\nFrom statement 13: xikdpus is puwppus.\n\nFrom statement 1: puwppus is babcpus.\n\nFrom statement 2: jupkpus is xikdpus? No, statement 2 says xifwpus is jupkpus, but statement 13 says xikdpus is puwppus.\n\nAlso, from statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is in xifwpus.\n\nBut xifwpus is jupkpus, so pecypus is in jupkpus.\n\nNow, what is jupkpus? From statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, but jupkpus itself might be a category.\n\nFrom statement 13: xikdpus is puwppus, and puwppus is babcpus, so xikdpus is in babcpus.\n\nBut is jupkpus related to xikdpus? From statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, and from statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is in jupkpus.\n\nBut from statement 10, givwpus is razbpus, and from statement 15, neccpus is givwpus, so neccpus is in razbpus.\n\nNow, from statement 3, noshpus is neccpus, so noshpus is in neccpus, so in razbpus.\n\nBut from statement 12, qobmpus is noshpus, so in razbpus.\n\nAnd so on, as I did earlier, x is in razbpus.\n\nBut for babcpus, I need to see if razbpus is connected to babcpus.\n\nFrom statement 10: givwpus is razbpus.\n\nFrom statement 15: neccpus is givwpus, so neccpus is in razbpus.\n\nBut from statement 3, noshpus is neccpus, so noshpus is in neccpus, so in razbpus.\n\nNow, from statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus.\n\nIs there a connection between neccpus and pecypus? Not directly.\n\nWhat about jupkpus? From statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, and pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is in jupkpus.\n\nBut from statement 13, xikdpus is puwppus, and puwppus is babcpus, so xikdpus is in babcpus.\n\nIs jupkpus related to xikdpus? From statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, but xifwpus is not xikdpus.\n\nLet's list all entities and see connections.\n\nI have x, which is in waxqpus.\n\nwaxqpus is in jivbpus.\n\njivbpus is in toxkpus.\n\ntoxkpus is in lincpus.\n\nlincpus is in mumhpus.\n\nmumhpus is in sesxpus.\n\nsesxpus is in qobmpus.\n\nqobmpus is in noshpus.\n\nnoshpus is in neccpus.\n\nneccpus is in givwpus.\n\ngivwpus is in razbpus.\n\nSo x is in razbpus.\n\nNow, razbpus is a category. What is razbpus? From statement 10, givwpus is razbpus, so razbpus contains givwpus.\n\nBut also, from statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus.\n\nNow, from statement 13, xikdpus is puwppus.\n\nAnd from statement 1, puwppus is babcpus.\n\nSo babcpus contains puwppus, which contains xikdpus.\n\nBut is there a link between razbpus and babcpus?\n\nFrom statement 15, neccpus is also in humypus and dalbpus, but that doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother statement: statement 4 is lincpus is mumhpus, which I used.\n\nStatement 9: mumhpus is sesxpus and puqypus, I used sesxpus.\n\nStatement 14: sesxpus is qobmpus, used.\n\nStatement 12: qobmpus is noshpus and yixmpus, used noshpus.\n\nStatement 3: noshpus is neccpus and nuprpus, used neccpus.\n\nStatement 15: neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus, used givwpus.\n\nStatement 10: givwpus is razbpus, used.\n\nNow, what about pecypus? From statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 2: xifwpus is jupkpus.\n\nBut also, from statement 13: xikdpus is puwppus.\n\nAnd from statement 1: puwppus is babcpus.\n\nBut is jupkpus related to xikdpus? Not directly.\n\nFrom statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, but xifwpus is not xikdpus.\n\nPerhaps from statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is in xifwpus, which is in jupkpus.\n\nBut jupkpus might be related to something else.\n\nStatement 2 says xifwpus is jupkpus, but also statement 4? No.\n\nAnother statement: statement 11 says x is waxqpus and texwpus, but I used waxqpus.\n\nI have texwpus not used yet, but可能无关.\n\nNow, from statement 6, toxkpus is lincpus and vaskpus, I used lincpus, but vaskpus might be another path, but I need babcpus.\n\nPerhaps I need to see if razbpus is babcpus or contains babcpus or something.\n\nFrom statement 10, givwpus is razbpus, so razbpus is a category that contains givwpus.\n\nBut from statement 15, neccpus is givwpus, so neccpus is in givwpus, so in razbpus.\n\nBut from statement 3, noshpus is neccpus, so noshpus is in neccpus, so in razbpus.\n\nBut what about pecypus? pecypus is not directly related to neccpus.\n\nHowever, from statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus.\n\nNow, is there a connection between jupkpus and razbpus? Not that I see.\n\nBut let's look at statement 4: lincpus is mumhpus, which I used.\n\nStatement 9: mumhpus is sesxpus and puqypus, I used sesxpus, but puqypus might be used, but I don't know what puqypus is.\n\nSimilarly, from statement 3, noshpus is also nuprpus, which I didn't use, but nuprpus might not help.\n\nFrom statement 12, qobmpus is also yixmpus, not used.\n\nFrom statement 15, neccpus is also humypus and dalbpus, not used.\n\nSo perhaps for x to be babcpus, I need a path from x to babcpus.\n\nI have a path from x to razbpus, but no path from razbpus to babcpus.\n\nBut let's see if razbpus is related to babcpus.\n\nFrom statement 10, givwpus is razbpus.\n\nFrom statement 15, neccpus is givwpus.\n\nBut from statement 3, noshpus is neccpus.\n\nFrom statement 12, qobmpus is noshpus.\n\nFrom statement 14, sesxpus is qobmpus.\n\nFrom statement 9, mumhpus is sesxpus.\n\nFrom statement 4, lincpus is mumhpus.\n\nFrom statement 6, toxkpus is lincpus.\n\nFrom statement 8, jivbpus is toxkpus.\n\nFrom statement 7, waxqpus is jivbpus.\n\nFrom statement 11, x is waxqpus.\n\nSo x is in razbpus.\n\nNow, for babcpus, from statement 1, puwppus is babcpus.\n\nFrom statement 13, xikdpus is puwppus.\n\nSo xikdpus is in babcpus.\n\nBut is xikdpus related to x? Not directly.\n\nFrom statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus.\n\nAnd from statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus.\n\nBut what is jupkpus? Is jupkpus related to xikdpus?\n\nStatement 2 says xifwpus is jupkpus, but no direct link to xikdpus.\n\nPerhaps from statement 13, xikdpus is puwppus, and puwppus is babcpus.\n\nBut also, from statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, and from statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is in jupkpus.\n\nNow, is there a statement that connects jupkpus to xikdpus? Let's see all statements.\n\nStatement 4: lincpus is mumhpus. No.\n\nStatement 9: mumhpus is sesxpus and puqypus. No.\n\nStatement 14: sesxpus is qobmpus. No.\n\nStatement 12: qobmpus is noshpus and yixmpus. No.\n\nStatement 3: noshpus is neccpus and nuprpus. No.\n\nStatement 15: neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus. No.\n\nStatement 10: givwpus is razbpus. No.\n\nStatement 5: pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus. No.\n\nStatement 6: toxkpus is lincpus and vaskpus. No.\n\nStatement 7: waxqpus is jivbpus and vevlpus. No.\n\nStatement 8: jivbpus is toxkpus. No.\n\nStatement 11: x is waxqpus and texwpus. No.\n\nStatement 13: xikdpus is puwppus. No.\n\nStatement 1: puwppus is babcpus. No.\n\nStatement 2: xifwpus is jupkpus. No.\n\nBut wait, there is statement: jupkpus is xikdpus? Is that given? Let's check the given information.\n\nThe given information includes: \"jupkpus is xikdpus\" ? No, let's read carefully.\n\n**Given Information**: puwppus is babcpus. xifwpus is jupkpus. noshpus is neccpus and nuprpus. lincpus is mumhpus. pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus. toxkpus is lincpus and vaskpus. waxqpus is jivbpus and vevlpus. jivbpus is toxkpus. mumhpus is sesxpus and puqypus. givwpus is razbpus. x is waxqpus and texwpus. qobmpus is noshpus and yixmpus. xikdpus is puwppus. sesxpus is qobmpus. neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus. jupkpus is xikdpus. razbpus is pecypus.\n\nI think I missed one statement! In the given information, after \"neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus.\" there is \"jupkpus is xikdpus.\" and then \"razbpus is pecypus.\"\n\nYes! I missed that. So let's add that.\n\nFrom the given: \"jupkpus is xikdpus.\" and \"razbpus is pecypus.\"\n\nSo, jupkpus is xikdpus? But from statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, so xifwpus is contained in jupkpus, and now jupkpus is xikdpus, so jupkpus is contained in xikdpus? Or based on the note, \"jupkpus is xikdpus\" means jupkpus belongs to category xikdpus, so jupkpus is contained in xikdpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"razbpus is pecypus\" means razbpus belongs to pecypus, so razbpus is contained in pecypus.\n\nNow, from earlier, I have x is in razbpus, so if razbpus is in pecypus, then x is in pecypus.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, from \"jupkpus is xikdpus\" so jupkpus is contained in xikdpus.\n\nAnd from statement 13, xikdpus is puwppus, so xikdpus is contained in puwppus.\n\nAnd from statement 1, puwppus is babcpus, so puwppus is contained in babcpus.\n\nThus, jupkpus is contained in xikdpus, which is in puwppus, which is in babcpus, so jupkpus is in babcpus.\n\nNow, from statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, so xifwpus is contained in jupkpus, so xifwpus is in babcpus.\n\nFrom statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is contained in xifwpus, so pecypus is in babcpus.\n\nNow, from the new statement, \"razbpus is pecypus\" so razbpus is contained in pecypus, so razbpus is in babcpus.\n\nAnd from earlier, x is in razbpus, so x is in babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus.\n\nSo, it is true.\n\nLet me confirm the chain.\n\nx is in waxqpus (from x is waxqpus)\n\nwaxqpus is in jivbpus (from waxqpus is jivbpus)\n\njivbpus is in toxkpus (from jivbpus is toxkpus)\n\ntoxkpus is in lincpus (from toxkpus is lincpus)\n\nlincpus is in mumhpus (from lincpus is mumhpus)\n\nmumhpus is in sesxpus (from mumhpus is sesxpus)\n\nsesxpus is in qobmpus (from sesxpus is qobmpus)\n\nqobmpus is in noshpus (from qobmpus is noshpus)\n\nnoshpus is in neccpus (from noshpus is neccpus)\n\nneccpus is in givwpus (from neccpus is givwpus)\n\ngivwpus is in razbpus (from givwpus is razbpus)\n\nSo x is in razbpus.\n\nNow, razbpus is in pecypus (from razbpus is pecypus)\n\npecypus is in xifwpus (from pecypus is xifwpus)\n\nxifwpus is in jupkpus (from xifwpus is jupkpus)\n\njupkpus is in xikdpus (from jupkpus is xikdpus)\n\nxikdpus is in puwppus (from xikdpus is puwppus)\n\npuwppus is in babcpus (from puwppus is babcpus)\n\nThus, x is in babcpus.\n\nSo, yes, it is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is true.",

From statement 10, givwpus is razbpus, but I need to connect razbpus to something else.\n\nFrom statement 15, neccpus is givwpus, so neccpus is in razbpus.\n\nBut from statement 3, noshpus is neccpus, so noshpus is in neccpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 12, qobmpus is noshpus, so qobmpus is in noshpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 14, sesxpus is qobmpus, so sesxpus is in qobmpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 9, mumhpus is sesxpus, so mumhpus is in sesxpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 4, lincpus is mumhpus, so lincpus is in mumhpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 6, toxkpus is lincpus, so toxkpus is in lincpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 8, jivbpus is toxkpus, so jivbpus is in toxkpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 7, waxqpus is jivbpus, so waxqpus is in jivbpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 11, x is waxqpus, so x is in waxqpus, thus in razbpus.\n\nSo x is in razbpus. But I need to see if x is in babcpus.\n\nrazbpus is from statement 10: givwpus is razbpus. But what is razbpus? Is razbpus related to babcpus?\n\nFrom statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus. But I have razbpus connected to pecypus? Let's see.\n\nFrom statement 10: givwpus is razbpus.\n\nFrom statement 15: neccpus is givwpus, so neccpus is in razbpus.\n\nBut from statement 3, noshpus is neccpus, so noshpus is in neccpus, so in razbpus.\n\nBut what about pecypus? pecypus is from statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus.\n\nIs there a connection between razbpus and pecypus?\n\nFrom statement 15, neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus. But neccpus is also a category that contains noshpus, etc.\n\nBut pecypus might be unrelated directly.\n\nFrom statement 2: xifwpus is jupkpus.\n\nFrom statement 13: xikdpus is puwppus.\n\nFrom statement 1: puwppus is babcpus.\n\nFrom statement 2: jupkpus is xikdpus? No, statement 2 says xifwpus is jupkpus, but statement 13 says xikdpus is puwppus.\n\nAlso, from statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is in xifwpus.\n\nBut xifwpus is jupkpus, so pecypus is in jupkpus.\n\nNow, what is jupkpus? From statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, but jupkpus itself might be a category.\n\nFrom statement 13: xikdpus is puwppus, and puwppus is babcpus, so xikdpus is in babcpus.\n\nBut is jupkpus related to xikdpus? From statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, and from statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is in jupkpus.\n\nBut from statement 10, givwpus is razbpus, and from statement 15, neccpus is givwpus, so neccpus is in razbpus.\n\nNow, from statement 3, noshpus is neccpus, so noshpus is in neccpus, so in razbpus.\n\nBut from statement 12, qobmpus is noshpus, so in razbpus.\n\nAnd so on, as I did earlier, x is in razbpus.\n\nBut for babcpus, I need to see if razbpus is connected to babcpus.\n\nFrom statement 10: givwpus is razbpus.\n\nFrom statement 15: neccpus is givwpus, so neccpus is in razbpus.\n\nBut from statement 3, noshpus is neccpus, so noshpus is in neccpus, so in razbpus.\n\nNow, from statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus.\n\nIs there a connection between neccpus and pecypus? Not directly.\n\nWhat about jupkpus? From statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, and pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is in jupkpus.\n\nBut from statement 13, xikdpus is puwppus, and puwppus is babcpus, so xikdpus is in babcpus.\n\nIs jupkpus related to xikdpus? From statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, but xifwpus is not xikdpus.\n\nLet's list all entities and see connections.\n\nI have x, which is in waxqpus.\n\nwaxqpus is in jivbpus.\n\njivbpus is in toxkpus.\n\ntoxkpus is in lincpus.\n\nlincpus is in mumhpus.\n\nmumhpus is in sesxpus.\n\nsesxpus is in qobmpus.\n\nqobmpus is in noshpus.\n\nnoshpus is in neccpus.\n\nneccpus is in givwpus.\n\ngivwpus is in razbpus.\n\nSo x is in razbpus.\n\nNow, razbpus is a category. What is razbpus? From statement 10, givwpus is razbpus, so razbpus contains givwpus.\n\nBut also, from statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus.\n\nNow, from statement 13, xikdpus is puwppus.\n\nAnd from statement 1, puwppus is babcpus.\n\nSo babcpus contains puwppus, which contains xikdpus.\n\nBut is there a link between razbpus and babcpus?\n\nFrom statement 15, neccpus is also in humypus and dalbpus, but that doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother statement: statement 4 is lincpus is mumhpus, which I used.\n\nStatement 9: mumhpus is sesxpus and puqypus, I used sesxpus.\n\nStatement 14: sesxpus is qobmpus, used.\n\nStatement 12: qobmpus is noshpus and yixmpus, used noshpus.\n\nStatement 3: noshpus is neccpus and nuprpus, used neccpus.\n\nStatement 15: neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus, used givwpus.\n\nStatement 10: givwpus is razbpus, used.\n\nNow, what about pecypus? From statement 5: pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 2: xifwpus is jupkpus.\n\nBut also, from statement 13: xikdpus is puwppus.\n\nAnd from statement 1: puwppus is babcpus.\n\nBut is jupkpus related to xikdpus? Not directly.\n\nFrom statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, but xifwpus is not xikdpus.\n\nPerhaps from statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is in xifwpus, which is in jupkpus.\n\nBut jupkpus might be related to something else.\n\nStatement 2 says xifwpus is jupkpus, but also statement 4? No.\n\nAnother statement: statement 11 says x is waxqpus and texwpus, but I used waxqpus.\n\nI have texwpus not used yet, but可能无关.\n\nNow, from statement 6, toxkpus is lincpus and vaskpus, I used lincpus, but vaskpus might be another path, but I need babcpus.\n\nPerhaps I need to see if razbpus is babcpus or contains babcpus or something.\n\nFrom statement 10, givwpus is razbpus, so razbpus is a category that contains givwpus.\n\nBut from statement 15, neccpus is givwpus, so neccpus is in givwpus, so in razbpus.\n\nBut from statement 3, noshpus is neccpus, so noshpus is in neccpus, so in razbpus.\n\nBut what about pecypus? pecypus is not directly related to neccpus.\n\nHowever, from statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus.\n\nNow, is there a connection between jupkpus and razbpus? Not that I see.\n\nBut let's look at statement 4: lincpus is mumhpus, which I used.\n\nStatement 9: mumhpus is sesxpus and puqypus, I used sesxpus, but puqypus might be used, but I don't know what puqypus is.\n\nSimilarly, from statement 3, noshpus is also nuprpus, which I didn't use, but nuprpus might not help.\n\nFrom statement 12, qobmpus is also yixmpus, not used.\n\nFrom statement 15, neccpus is also humypus and dalbpus, not used.\n\nSo perhaps for x to be babcpus, I need a path from x to babcpus.\n\nI have a path from x to razbpus, but no path from razbpus to babcpus.\n\nBut let's see if razbpus is related to babcpus.\n\nFrom statement 10, givwpus is razbpus.\n\nFrom statement 15, neccpus is givwpus.\n\nBut from statement 3, noshpus is neccpus.\n\nFrom statement 12, qobmpus is noshpus.\n\nFrom statement 14, sesxpus is qobmpus.\n\nFrom statement 9, mumhpus is sesxpus.\n\nFrom statement 4, lincpus is mumhpus.\n\nFrom statement 6, toxkpus is lincpus.\n\nFrom statement 8, jivbpus is toxkpus.\n\nFrom statement 7, waxqpus is jivbpus.\n\nFrom statement 11, x is waxqpus.\n\nSo x is in razbpus.\n\nNow, for babcpus, from statement 1, puwppus is babcpus.\n\nFrom statement 13, xikdpus is puwppus.\n\nSo xikdpus is in babcpus.\n\nBut is xikdpus related to x? Not directly.\n\nFrom statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus.\n\nAnd from statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus.\n\nBut what is jupkpus? Is jupkpus related to xikdpus?\n\nStatement 2 says xifwpus is jupkpus, but no direct link to xikdpus.\n\nPerhaps from statement 13, xikdpus is puwppus, and puwppus is babcpus.\n\nBut also, from statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, and from statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is in jupkpus.\n\nNow, is there a statement that connects jupkpus to xikdpus? Let's see all statements.\n\nStatement 4: lincpus is mumhpus. No.\n\nStatement 9: mumhpus is sesxpus and puqypus. No.\n\nStatement 14: sesxpus is qobmpus. No.\n\nStatement 12: qobmpus is noshpus and yixmpus. No.\n\nStatement 3: noshpus is neccpus and nuprpus. No.\n\nStatement 15: neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus. No.\n\nStatement 10: givwpus is razbpus. No.\n\nStatement 5: pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus. No.\n\nStatement 6: toxkpus is lincpus and vaskpus. No.\n\nStatement 7: waxqpus is jivbpus and vevlpus. No.\n\nStatement 8: jivbpus is toxkpus. No.\n\nStatement 11: x is waxqpus and texwpus. No.\n\nStatement 13: xikdpus is puwppus. No.\n\nStatement 1: puwppus is babcpus. No.\n\nStatement 2: xifwpus is jupkpus. No.\n\nBut wait, there is statement: jupkpus is xikdpus? Is that given? Let's check the given information.\n\nThe given information includes: \"jupkpus is xikdpus\" ? No, let's read carefully.\n\n**Given Information**: puwppus is babcpus. xifwpus is jupkpus. noshpus is neccpus and nuprpus. lincpus is mumhpus. pecypus is xifwpus and nabbpus. toxkpus is lincpus and vaskpus. waxqpus is jivbpus and vevlpus. jivbpus is toxkpus. mumhpus is sesxpus and puqypus. givwpus is razbpus. x is waxqpus and texwpus. qobmpus is noshpus and yixmpus. xikdpus is puwppus. sesxpus is qobmpus. neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus. jupkpus is xikdpus. razbpus is pecypus.\n\nI think I missed one statement! In the given information, after \"neccpus is givwpus and humypus and dalbpus.\" there is \"jupkpus is xikdpus.\" and then \"razbpus is pecypus.\"\n\nYes! I missed that. So let's add that.\n\nFrom the given: \"jupkpus is xikdpus.\" and \"razbpus is pecypus.\"\n\nSo, jupkpus is xikdpus? But from statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, so xifwpus is contained in jupkpus, and now jupkpus is xikdpus, so jupkpus is contained in xikdpus? Or based on the note, \"jupkpus is xikdpus\" means jupkpus belongs to category xikdpus, so jupkpus is contained in xikdpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"razbpus is pecypus\" means razbpus belongs to pecypus, so razbpus is contained in pecypus.\n\nNow, from earlier, I have x is in razbpus, so if razbpus is in pecypus, then x is in pecypus.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, from \"jupkpus is xikdpus\" so jupkpus is contained in xikdpus.\n\nAnd from statement 13, xikdpus is puwppus, so xikdpus is contained in puwppus.\n\nAnd from statement 1, puwppus is babcpus, so puwppus is contained in babcpus.\n\nThus, jupkpus is contained in xikdpus, which is in puwppus, which is in babcpus, so jupkpus is in babcpus.\n\nNow, from statement 2, xifwpus is jupkpus, so xifwpus is contained in jupkpus, so xifwpus is in babcpus.\n\nFrom statement 5, pecypus is xifwpus, so pecypus is contained in xifwpus, so pecypus is in babcpus.\n\nNow, from the new statement, \"razbpus is pecypus\" so razbpus is contained in pecypus, so razbpus is in babcpus.\n\nAnd from earlier, x is in razbpus, so x is in babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus.\n\nSo, it is true.\n\nLet me confirm the chain.\n\nx is in waxqpus (from x is waxqpus)\n\nwaxqpus is in jivbpus (from waxqpus is jivbpus)\n\njivbpus is in toxkpus (from jivbpus is toxkpus)\n\ntoxkpus is in lincpus (from toxkpus is lincpus)\n\nlincpus is in mumhpus (from lincpus is mumhpus)\n\nmumhpus is in sesxpus (from mumhpus is sesxpus)\n\nsesxpus is in qobmpus (from sesxpus is qobmpus)\n\nqobmpus is in noshpus (from qobmpus is noshpus)\n\nnoshpus is in neccpus (from noshpus is neccpus)\n\nneccpus is in givwpus (from neccpus is givwpus)\n\ngivwpus is in razbpus (from givwpus is razbpus)\n\nSo x is in razbpus.\n\nNow, razbpus is in pecypus (from razbpus is pecypus)\n\npecypus is in xifwpus (from pecypus is xifwpus)\n\nxifwpus is in jupkpus (from xifwpus is jupkpus)\n\njupkpus is in xikdpus (from jupkpus is xikdpus)\n\nxikdpus is in puwppus (from xikdpus is puwppus)\n\npuwppus is in babcpus (from puwppus is babcpus)\n\nThus, x is in babcpus.\n\nSo, yes, it is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is true.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nTherefore, the answer is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

Let's see.\n\nFrom the given: \"huvhpus is besfpus.\" and then \"huvhpus is guvmpus.\" So huvhpus is both besfpus and guvmpus?

Based on the chain, yes.\n\nBut let me confirm if there is any direct relation or if this is correct.\n\nWe also have other paths, but this seems to work.\n\nNote that x is also zupppus, but since zupppus is not defined anywhere, it might not help, so we rely on gurmpus.\n\nSo, from above, x is gurmpus, and through the chain, gurmpus is komypus, etc., eventually to vuzdpus, which is babbpus, so since vuzdpus is babbpus, meaning vuzdpus contains babbpus? No, from the statement: \"vuzdpus is babbpus and kaxmpus\" which means vuzdpus belongs to babbpus? Or does it mean vuzdpus contains babbpus?\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So it could be interpreted in two ways.\n\nBut in the context, let's see the usage.\n\nFor example, \"loynpus is jonrpus and himgpus\" meaning loynpus belongs to jonrpus and himgpus? Or loynpus contains jonrpus and himgpus?\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B. So it's ambiguous.\n\nBut in the question, we need to see if x is babbpus, meaning does x belong to babbpus or is x contained in babbpus?\n\nFrom the chain, if we go from x to babbpus, we might have x belonging to babbpus.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nIn the statement \"vuzdpus is babbpus\" which according to the note, could mean vuzdpus belongs to babbpus or vuzdpus contains babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, in my chain, I have from vuzdpus to babbpus, so if vuzdpus belongs to babbpus, then since gisppus is vuzdpus, gisppus belongs to vuzdpus, so gisppus belongs to babbpus? But that would mean that things above belong to things below? Let's think.\n\nTypically, if A is B, meaning A is a subset of B or A is an instance of B, so A belongs to B.\n\nBut in the note, it says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B, which might mean B contains A, so A is contained in B means B contains A, so A belongs to B.\n\nI think there is confusion in terminology.\n\nLet me read the note carefully: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\"\n\nSo, \"A is B\" means either A belongs to B or A is contained in B. But \"belongs to\" and \"contained in\" might be opposites.\n\nIn set theory, if A belongs to B, then B contains A. But if A is contained in B, it might mean A is a subset of B, so B contains A only if we say B contains A as an element or as a subset.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps in this context, \"A is B\" means that A is a type of B, so B is a broader category, and A is a specific instance or subset, so A belongs to B.\n\nFor example, if \"apple is fruit\", then apple belongs to the category fruit.\n\nSimilarly, \"vuzdpus is babbpus\" would mean vuzdpus belongs to the category babbpus, so babbpus is a category that includes vuzdpus.\n\nBut in the chain, when we say \"gisppus is vuzdpus\", then gisppus belongs to vuzdpus, so vuzdpus is a category that includes gisppus.\n\nThen \"vuzdpus is babbpus\" so vuzdpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus is a higher category that includes vuzdpus.\n\nSo, for x to be babbpus, we need x to belong to babbpus, meaning that babbpus is a category that includes x.\n\nFrom the chain, we have x belonging to gurmpus, which belongs to komypus, and so on, down to vuzdpus, which belongs to babbpus. So since vuzdpus belongs to babbpus, and x belongs to vuzdpus through the chain, then x belongs to babbpus.\n\nBut let's see the belonging chain.\n\nx is gurmpus → so x belongs to gurmpus? Or is x gurmpus? From the statement: \"x is gurmpus and zupppus\" so x belongs to gurmpus and also to zupppus.\n\nSimilarly, gurmpus is komypus → so gurmpus belongs to komypus.\n\nSo, if x belongs to gurmpus, and gurmpus belongs to komypus, then x belongs to komypus? Is that transitive?\n\nIn set theory, if x is an element of A, and A is a subset of B, then x is an element of B. But here, \"belongs to\" might mean is a subset of or is an element of.\n\nIn this context, since we have categories, likely \"A is B\" means A is a subset of B, so A belongs to B as a subcategory.\n\nBut for x, x is a thing that belongs to categories.\n\nFrom \"x is gurmpus and zupppus\", so x is an element that belongs to the sets gurmpus and zupppus.\n\nThen \"gurmpus is komypus\" means that the set gurmpus is a subset of komypus, so any element in gurmpus is also in komypus. Therefore, since x is in gurmpus, x is in komypus.\n\nSimilarly, komypus is tokzpus, so komypus subset of tokzpus, so x in tokzpus.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nEventually, we have vuzdpus is babbpus, so vuzdpus subset of babbpus, so any element in vuzdpus is in babbpus.\n\nNow, from the chain, we need to see if x is in vuzdpus.\n\nFrom the chain: we have from komypus to tokzpus to zosxpus to yibhpus to cuffpus to parcpus to tuxrpus to guctpus to zosypus to tatbpus to cohwpus to sanzpus to liwspus to veghpus to wofvpus to fazjpus to soctpus to haprpus to tabfpus to yoqdpus to nujkpus to loynpus to jonrpus to lebspus to gisppus to vuzdpus.\n\nBut note: when we say \"gisppus is vuzdpus\" which means gisppus subset of vuzdpus, so if x is in gisppus, then x is in vuzdpus.\n\nBut in the chain, we have x in komypus, but we need to get to gisppus.\n\nFrom the chain above, we have from zosypus to tatbpus to cohwpus to sanzpus to liwspus to veghpus to wofvpus to fazjpus to soctpus to haprpus to tabfpus to yoqdpus to nujkpus to loynpus to jonrpus to lebspus to gisppus.\n\nBut we have zosypus from guctpus, and guctpus from tuxrpus, etc., and we have x in guctpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom x in komypus, komypus is tokzpus, so x in tokzpus.\n\ntokzpus is zosxpus, so x in zosxpus.\n\nzosxpus is yibhpus and lirlpus and nelfpus, so x in yibhpus? Since zosxpus is yibhpus, meaning zosxpus subset of yibhpus? Or is it that zosxpus contains yibhpus?\n\nAccording to the meaning, \"zosxpus is yibhpus\" means that zosxpus belongs to yibhpus, so zosxpus subset of yibhpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is in zosxpus, x is in yibhpus.\n\nyibhpus is cuffpus and bollpus, so yibhpus subset of cuffpus and subset of bollpus? Or does it mean yibhpus belongs to cuffpus, so yibhpus subset of cuffpus.\n\nSimilarly, cuffpus is parcpus and futbpus, so cuffpus subset of parcpus and subset of futbpus.\n\nparcpus is tuxrpus, so parcpus subset of tuxrpus.\n\ntuxrpus is guctpus, so tuxrpus subset of guctpus.\n\nguctpus is zosypus and jepypus and jecmpus and hotfpus, so guctpus subset of zosypus, etc.\n\nSo, since x is in guctpus, and guctpus subset of zosypus, so x in zosypus.\n\nNow, zosypus is tatbpus and also zosypus is huvhpus and hilypus. So zosypus subset of tatbpus and subset of huvhpus and subset of hilypus.\n\nBut we need tatbpus for the chain.\n\nzosypus subset of tatbpus.\n\ntatbpus is cohwpus and mijfpus, so tatbpus subset of cohwpus and subset of mijfpus.\n\nSo x in tatbpus, so x in cohwpus.\n\ncohwpus is sanzpus and zavnpus, so cohwpus subset of sanzpus and subset of zavnpus.\n\nSo x in sanzpus.\n\nsanzpus is liwspus, so sanzpus subset of liwspus, so x in liwspus.\n\nliwspus is veghpus, so liwspus subset of veghpus, so x in veghpus.\n\nveghpus is wofvpus and zitnpus, so veghpus subset of wofvpus and subset of zitnpus, so x in wofvpus.\n\nwofvpus is fazjpus and vujgpus, so wofvpus subset of fazjpus and subset of vujgpus, so x in fazjpus.\n\nfazjpus is soctpus and hubnpus, so fazjpus subset of soctpus and subset of hubnpus, so x in soctpus.\n\nsoctpus is haprpus and moqcpus, so soctpus subset of haprpus and subset of moqcpus, so x in haprpus.\n\nhaprpus is tabfpus, so haprpus subset of tabfpus, so x in tabfpus.\n\ntabfpus is yoqdpus and lohspus, so tabfpus subset of yoqdpus and subset of lohspus, so x in yoqdpus.\n\nyoqdpus is nujkpus, so yoqdpus subset of nujkpus, so x in nujkpus.\n\nnujkpus is loynpus and cumtpus, so nujkpus subset of loynpus and subset of cumtpus, so x in loynpus.\n\nloynpus is jonrpus and himgpus, so loynpus subset of jonrpus and subset of himgpus, so x in jonrpus.\n\njonrpus is lebspus, so jonrpus subset of lebspus, so x in lebspus.\n\nlebspus is gisppus, so lebspus subset of gisppus, so x in gisppus.\n\ngisppus is vuzdpus, so gisppus subset of vuzdpus, so x in vuzdpus.\n\nvuzdpus is babbpus and kaxmpus, so vuzdpus subset of babbpus and subset of kaxmpus, so x in babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x belongs to babbpus.\n\nSo, it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus?\" which means x belongs to babbpus, which we have shown.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no other interpretations.\n\nWe also have that x is zupppus, but since zupppus is not defined, it doesn't affect this.\n\nSo, based on the reasoning, it is true.",

But \"belongs to\" and \"contained in\" might be opposites.\n\nIn set theory, if A belongs to B, then B contains A. But if A is contained in B, it might mean A is a subset of B, so B contains A only if we say B contains A as an element or as a subset.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps in this context, \"A is B\" means that A is a type of B, so B is a broader category, and A is a specific instance or subset, so A belongs to B.\n\nFor example, if \"apple is fruit\", then apple belongs to the category fruit.\n\nSimilarly, \"vuzdpus is babbpus\" would mean vuzdpus belongs to the category babbpus, so babbpus is a category that includes vuzdpus.\n\nBut in the chain, when we say \"gisppus is vuzdpus\", then gisppus belongs to vuzdpus, so vuzdpus is a category that includes gisppus.\n\nThen \"vuzdpus is babbpus\" so vuzdpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus is a higher category that includes vuzdpus.\n\nSo, for x to be babbpus, we need x to belong to babbpus, meaning that babbpus is a category that includes x.\n\nFrom the chain, we have x belonging to gurmpus, which belongs to komypus, and so on, down to vuzdpus, which belongs to babbpus. So since vuzdpus belongs to babbpus, and x belongs to vuzdpus through the chain, then x belongs to babbpus.\n\nBut let's see the belonging chain.\n\nx is gurmpus → so x belongs to gurmpus? Or is x gurmpus? From the statement: \"x is gurmpus and zupppus\" so x belongs to gurmpus and also to zupppus.\n\nSimilarly, gurmpus is komypus → so gurmpus belongs to komypus.\n\nSo, if x belongs to gurmpus, and gurmpus belongs to komypus, then x belongs to komypus? Is that transitive?\n\nIn set theory, if x is an element of A, and A is a subset of B, then x is an element of B. But here, \"belongs to\" might mean is a subset of or is an element of.\n\nIn this context, since we have categories, likely \"A is B\" means A is a subset of B, so A belongs to B as a subcategory.\n\nBut for x, x is a thing that belongs to categories.\n\nFrom \"x is gurmpus and zupppus\", so x is an element that belongs to the sets gurmpus and zupppus.\n\nThen \"gurmpus is komypus\" means that the set gurmpus is a subset of komypus, so any element in gurmpus is also in komypus. Therefore, since x is in gurmpus, x is in komypus.\n\nSimilarly, komypus is tokzpus, so komypus subset of tokzpus, so x in tokzpus.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nEventually, we have vuzdpus is babbpus, so vuzdpus subset of babbpus, so any element in vuzdpus is in babbpus.\n\nNow, from the chain, we need to see if x is in vuzdpus.\n\nFrom the chain: we have from komypus to tokzpus to zosxpus to yibhpus to cuffpus to parcpus to tuxrpus to guctpus to zosypus to tatbpus to cohwpus to sanzpus to liwspus to veghpus to wofvpus to fazjpus to soctpus to haprpus to tabfpus to yoqdpus to nujkpus to loynpus to jonrpus to lebspus to gisppus to vuzdpus.\n\nBut note: when we say \"gisppus is vuzdpus\" which means gisppus subset of vuzdpus, so if x is in gisppus, then x is in vuzdpus.\n\nBut in the chain, we have x in komypus, but we need to get to gisppus.\n\nFrom the chain above, we have from zosypus to tatbpus to cohwpus to sanzpus to liwspus to veghpus to wofvpus to fazjpus to soctpus to haprpus to tabfpus to yoqdpus to nujkpus to loynpus to jonrpus to lebspus to gisppus.\n\nBut we have zosypus from guctpus, and guctpus from tuxrpus, etc., and we have x in guctpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom x in komypus, komypus is tokzpus, so x in tokzpus.\n\ntokzpus is zosxpus, so x in zosxpus.\n\nzosxpus is yibhpus and lirlpus and nelfpus, so x in yibhpus? Since zosxpus is yibhpus, meaning zosxpus subset of yibhpus? Or is it that zosxpus contains yibhpus?\n\nAccording to the meaning, \"zosxpus is yibhpus\" means that zosxpus belongs to yibhpus, so zosxpus subset of yibhpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is in zosxpus, x is in yibhpus.\n\nyibhpus is cuffpus and bollpus, so yibhpus subset of cuffpus and subset of bollpus? Or does it mean yibhpus belongs to cuffpus, so yibhpus subset of cuffpus.\n\nSimilarly, cuffpus is parcpus and futbpus, so cuffpus subset of parcpus and subset of futbpus.\n\nparcpus is tuxrpus, so parcpus subset of tuxrpus.\n\ntuxrpus is guctpus, so tuxrpus subset of guctpus.\n\nguctpus is zosypus and jepypus and jecmpus and hotfpus, so guctpus subset of zosypus, etc.\n\nSo, since x is in guctpus, and guctpus subset of zosypus, so x in zosypus.\n\nNow, zosypus is tatbpus and also zosypus is huvhpus and hilypus. So zosypus subset of tatbpus and subset of huvhpus and subset of hilypus.\n\nBut we need tatbpus for the chain.\n\nzosypus subset of tatbpus.\n\ntatbpus is cohwpus and mijfpus, so tatbpus subset of cohwpus and subset of mijfpus.\n\nSo x in tatbpus, so x in cohwpus.\n\ncohwpus is sanzpus and zavnpus, so cohwpus subset of sanzpus and subset of zavnpus.\n\nSo x in sanzpus.\n\nsanzpus is liwspus, so sanzpus subset of liwspus, so x in liwspus.\n\nliwspus is veghpus, so liwspus subset of veghpus, so x in veghpus.\n\nveghpus is wofvpus and zitnpus, so veghpus subset of wofvpus and subset of zitnpus, so x in wofvpus.\n\nwofvpus is fazjpus and vujgpus, so wofvpus subset of fazjpus and subset of vujgpus, so x in fazjpus.\n\nfazjpus is soctpus and hubnpus, so fazjpus subset of soctpus and subset of hubnpus, so x in soctpus.\n\nsoctpus is haprpus and moqcpus, so soctpus subset of haprpus and subset of moqcpus, so x in haprpus.\n\nhaprpus is tabfpus, so haprpus subset of tabfpus, so x in tabfpus.\n\ntabfpus is yoqdpus and lohspus, so tabfpus subset of yoqdpus and subset of lohspus, so x in yoqdpus.\n\nyoqdpus is nujkpus, so yoqdpus subset of nujkpus, so x in nujkpus.\n\nnujkpus is loynpus and cumtpus, so nujkpus subset of loynpus and subset of cumtpus, so x in loynpus.\n\nloynpus is jonrpus and himgpus, so loynpus subset of jonrpus and subset of himgpus, so x in jonrpus.\n\njonrpus is lebspus, so jonrpus subset of lebspus, so x in lebspus.\n\nlebspus is gisppus, so lebspus subset of gisppus, so x in gisppus.\n\ngisppus is vuzdpus, so gisppus subset of vuzdpus, so x in vuzdpus.\n\nvuzdpus is babbpus and kaxmpus, so vuzdpus subset of babbpus and subset of kaxmpus, so x in babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x belongs to babbpus.\n\nSo, it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus?\" which means x belongs to babbpus, which we have shown.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no other interpretations.\n\nWe also have that x is zupppus, but since zupppus is not defined, it doesn't affect this.\n\nSo, based on the reasoning, it is true.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nBut in the note, it says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B, which might mean B contains A, so A is contained in B means B contains A, so A belongs to B.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

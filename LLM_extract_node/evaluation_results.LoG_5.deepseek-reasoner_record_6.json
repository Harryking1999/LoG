From statement 5: x is najcpus.\n\nFrom statement 6: najcpus is xayxpus and jescpus. So x is also xayxpus and jescpus.\n\nNow, I need babcpus. From statement 8: coyxpus is babcpus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is related to coyxpus.\n\nI know that hahkpus is coyxpus from statement 2.\n\nAnd from statement 4: tolvpus is hahkpus and tokwpus. So tolvpus includes hahkpus.\n\nAlso, from statement 13: fapmpus is tolvpus.\n\nFrom statement 11: puywpus is fapmpus.\n\nFrom statement 7: vipmpus is puywpus.\n\nFrom statement 12: magjpus is vipmpus.\n\nFrom statement 10: xayxpus is magjpus and rafdpus.\n\nBut x is xayxpus, so x is magjpus (from statement 10).\n\nSince magjpus is vipmpus (12), and vipmpus is puywpus (7), puywpus is fapmpus (11), fapmpus is tolvpus (13), tolvpus is hahkpus (4), and hahkpus is coyxpus (2), and coyxpus is babcpus (8).\n\nSo, let's chain this together for x:\n\nx is xayxpus (from 5 and 6).\n\nxayxpus is magjpus (10).\n\nmagjpus is vipmpus (12).\n\nvipmpus is puywpus (7).\n\npuywpus is fapmpus (11).\n\nfapmpus is tolvpus (13).\n\ntolvpus is hahkpus (4).\n\nhahkpus is coyxpus (2).\n\ncoyxpus is babcpus (8).\n\nTherefore, x is babcpus. So, one part is satisfied.\n\nNow, I need babrpus. From statement 9: hahkpus is babrpus and padmpus.\n\nSince I already have that x is connected to hahkpus through the chain above, and hahkpus is babrpus, so x should be babrpus as well.\n\nFrom the chain: x is tolvpus (since fapmpus is tolvpus, and x is fapmpus through the chain? Let me see.\n\nFrom above: x is fapmpus? Let's clarify the chain.\n\nx is xayxpus\n\nxayxpus is magjpus\n\nmagjpus is vipmpus\n\nvipmpus is puywpus\n\npuywpus is fapmpus\n\nfapmpus is tolvpus\n\ntolvpus is hahkpus\n\nSo, since tolvpus is hahkpus, and fapmpus is tolvpus, so fapmpus is hahkpus? But remember, \"is\" means belongs to category, so it's transitive in a way, but we have to be careful.\n\nIf A is B, and B is C, then A is C? In this context, since it's categories, it should be transitive. For example, if x is najcpus, and najcpus is xayxpus, then x is xayxpus. Similarly, if xayxpus is magjpus, then x is magjpus, and so on.\n\nSo, from the chain, x is tolvpus because x is fapmpus? Let's see:\n\nx is xayxpus\n\nxayxpus is magjpus → so x is magjpus\n\nmagjpus is vipmpus → so x is vipmpus\n\nvipmpus is puywpus → so x is puywpus\n\npuywpus is fapmpus → so x is fapmpus\n\nfapmpus is tolvpus → so x is tolvpus\n\ntolvpus is hahkpus → so x is hahkpus\n\nAnd since hahkpus is babrpus (from statement 9), therefore x is babrpus.\n\nSo, x is babrpus.\n\nNow, for babspus. From statement 3: hahkpus is babspus and rowmpus.\n\nSince we have x is hahkpus, then x is babspus.\n\nSo, overall, x is babcpus, babrpus, and babspus.\n\nTherefore, it should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any contradictions or missing links.\n\nI have x is hahkpus, which seems correct from the chain.\n\nAnd from hahkpus, we have babcpus through coyxpus, but since x is hahkpus, and hahkpus is coyxpus, and coyxpus is babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nSimilarly, directly from hahkpus, we have babrpus and babspus.\n\nSo, all good.\n\nThe question is: x is babcpus and babrpus and babspus? And from above, it seems true.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there any statement that might prevent this? For example, is there anything that says x is not something? But from the given, all statements are positive, so no negative information.\n\nAlso, note that in statement 4, tolvpus is hahkpus and tokwpus, meaning tolvpus belongs to hahkpus and tokwpus? Wait, no: \"tolvpus is hahkpus and tokwpus\" means that tolvpus is a subset of hahkpus and also a subset of tokwpus? Or does it mean that tolvpus has categories hahkpus and tokwpus?\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, if we say \"tolvpus is hahkpus\", it means tolvpus is contained in hahkpus, meaning that every tolvpus is also hahkpus. Similarly, \"tolvpus is tokwpus\" means every tolvpus is tokwpus.\n\nBut in statement 4, it says \"tolvpus is hahkpus and tokwpus\", which likely means tolvpus is contained in hahkpus and also contained in tokwpus. So, tolvpus ⊆ hahkpus and tolvpus ⊆ tokwpus.\n\nSimilarly, in other statements, when it says \"A is B and C\", it means A is contained in B and A is contained in C.\n\nSo, in my chain, when I say x is tolvpus, and tolvpus is hahkpus, then x is hahkpus, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, hahkpus is coyxpus, so x is coyxpus, and coyxpus is babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nAnd hahkpus is babrpus, so x is babrpus.\n\nAnd hahkpus is babspus, so x is babspus.\n\nSo, all confirmed.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

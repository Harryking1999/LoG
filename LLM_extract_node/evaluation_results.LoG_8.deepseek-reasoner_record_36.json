From \"malfpus is foqmpus and susdpus\" and \"malfpus is fudzpus and gumdpus\"? That might be multiple categories, but in this context, \"is\" might mean belongs to, so malfpus belongs to multiple categories.\n\nBut from malfpus, we have fudzpus, which is bulrpus and tanspus, and so on, but that seems to lead away from babcpus.\n\nPerhaps I should look for babcpus directly.\n\nbabcpus is mentioned only in \"kogkpus is babcpus\", so babcpus contains kogkpus.\n\nkogkpus is contained in lorxpus? No, \"lorxpus is kogkpus\" means lorxpus belongs to kogkpus? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So if A is B, then A is a member of B, meaning B is a category that contains A.\n\nSo \"lorxpus is kogkpus\" means lorxpus belongs to kogkpus, so kogkpus is a category that contains lorxpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"kogkpus is babcpus\" means kogkpus belongs to babcpus, so babcpus contains kogkpus.\n\nSo for x to be babcpus, x must be the category babcpus itself, but x is reskpus and ficbpus, which are categories or items, so x is contained in reskpus and ficbpus, meaning x is a member of those categories.\n\nBut the question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus?\" meaning does x belong to babbpus or babcpus?\n\nSo we need to see if x is contained in babbpus or babcpus.\n\nbabbpus is not mentioned anywhere in the given information. The only mention is babcpus, so babbpus might be a typo or something, but based on the information, babbpus is not defined, so we might not know about babbpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus?\" so we need to see if x belongs to either.\n\nSince babbpus is not mentioned, it might be unknown, but let's see about babcpus.\n\nSo for x to be babcpus, x must be a member of babcpus, meaning babcpus must contain x.\n\nBut from the information, babcpus contains kogkpus, as per \"kogkpus is babcpus\".\n\nSo if x is kogkpus or contained in kogkpus, then x would be in babcpus.\n\nBut is x kogkpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom x, we have x is reskpus, and reskpus is jatbpus, jatbpus is wafhpus, wafhpus is basdpus.\n\nNow, basdpus is piqrpus and kanppus and zicjpus. So basdpus contains these, but x is in basdpus? Since wafhpus is basdpus, and jatbpus is wafhpus, and reskpus is jatbpus, and x is reskpus, so x is contained in reskpus, which is contained in jatbpus, which is contained in wafhpus, which is contained in basdpus. So x is contained in basdpus.\n\nBut basdpus contains piqrpus, etc., but that doesn't directly link to kogkpus.\n\nNow, where is kogkpus? From \"lorxpus is kogkpus\" and \"yezvpus is lorxpus\" and \"raftpus is yezvpus\" and \"xijqpus is raftpus\" and \"miwlpus is xijqpus\" and \"cozmpus is miwlpus and cuvbpus\" and \"bekcpus is cozmpus and sosmpus\" and \"fuzgpus is bekcpus and qedfpus\" and \"nobtpus is fuzgpus and bosspus\" and \"yizlpus is nobtpus\" and \"dizjpus is yizlpus and zesypus\" and \"gepxpus is dizjpus and sitfpus\" and \"sowgpus is gepxpus\" and \"civmpus is sowgpus and surjpus\" and \"daprpus is civmpus\" and \"faylpus is daprpus and lajjpus\" and \"yoglpus is faylpus and qegfpus\" and \"geqrpus is yoglpus\" and \"tolvpus is geqrpus\" and \"fukspus is tolvpus\" and \"hengpus is fukspus and puqmpus\" and \"vogkpus is hengpus\" and \"yagrpus is vogkpus and peynpus\" and \"tuvkpus is yagrpus and cigfpus\" and \"jokmpus is tuvkpus and zelcpus\" and \"jelspus is jokmpus\" and \"bulrpus is jelspus and siblpus\" and \"fudzpus is bulrpus and tanspus\" and \"malfpus is fudzpus and gumdpus\" and \"savfpus is malfpus and qixcpus\" and \"piqrpus is savfpus\" and we have piqrpus is contained in basdpus, but from above, basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is savfpus, etc., but this is a long chain, and we have kogkpus on the other side.\n\nBut from kogkpus, we have \"lorxpus is kogkpus\" so kogkpus contains lorxpus, and lorxpus contains yezvpus? No, \"yezvpus is lorxpus\" so yezvpus belongs to lorxpus, so lorxpus contains yezvpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"raftpus is yezvpus\" so raftpus belongs to yezvpus, so yezvpus contains raftpus.\n\nBut from the chain, we have xijqpus is raftpus, so xijqpus belongs to raftpus, so raftpus contains xijqpus.\n\nBut xijqpus is also contained in miwlpus? \"miwlpus is xijqpus\" so miwlpus belongs to xijqpus? Let's clarify.\n\n\"miwlpus is xijqpus\" means miwlpus belongs to xijqpus, so xijqpus contains miwlpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"cozmpus is miwlpus and cuvbpus\" so cozmpus belongs to miwlpus and cuvbpus, so miwlpus contains cozmpus, and cuvbpus contains cozmpus.\n\nBut for x, we are far from this.\n\nx is in basdpus, and basdpus contains piqrpus, which is savfpus, which contains malfpus, etc., but this chain doesn't seem to connect to kogkpus.\n\nPerhaps there is another way.\n\nWe also have \"yezvpus is lorxpus\" and \"raftpus is yezvpus\" but from \"xijqpus is raftpus\" and \"miwlpus is xijqpus\" but miwlpus is part of cozmpus, which is part of bekcpus, etc., but no direct link to x.\n\nx is reskpus, which is jatbpus, which is wafhpus, which is basdpus.\n\nNow, is basdpus related to kogkpus? From \"lorxpus is kogkpus\" and \"yezvpus is lorxpus\" but yezvpus is also mentioned in \"raftpus is yezvpus\" and from \"xijqpus is raftpus\" but xijqpus is also mentioned in \"miwlpus is xijqpus\" and \"cozmpus is miwlpus\" but cozmpus is in bekcpus, etc.\n\nBut let's see if there is a common category.\n\nNotice that \"basdpus is piqrpus and kanppus and zicjpus\" and piqrpus is savfpus, etc., but also, from \"zahwpus is guxjpus\" and \"tannpus is zahwpus and sunppus\" and \"rexjpus is tannpus\" and \"fudzpus is rexjpus\" but fudzpus is also in malfpus, etc.\n\nBut for kogkpus, we have \"lorxpus is kogkpus\" and \"yezvpus is lorxpus\" and from \"raftpus is yezvpus\" but also from the information, \"raftpus is sumwpus\" and \"raftpus is yezvpus\" so raftpus belongs to both sumwpus and yezvpus? That might be possible.\n\nBut from x, we need to see if x is in the chain that leads to kogkpus.\n\nAnother thought: from \"reskpus is jatbpus\" and \"wafhpus is basdpus\" but also from \"basdpus is piqrpus\" and \"piqrpus is savfpus\" and \"savfpus is malfpus\" and \"malfpus is fudzpus\" and \"fudzpus is bulrpus\" and \"bulrpus is jelspus\" and \"jelspus is jokmpus\" and \"jokmpus is tuvkpus\" and \"tuvkpus is yagrpus\" and \"yagrpus is vogkpus\" and \"vogkpus is hengpus\" and \"hengpus is fukspus\" and \"fukspus is tolvpus\" and \"tolvpus is geqrpus\" and \"geqrpus is yoglpus\" and \"yoglpus is faylpus\" and \"faylpus is daprpus\" and \"daprpus is civmpus\" and \"civmpus is sowgpus\" and \"sowgpus is gepxpus\" and \"gepxpus is dizjpus\" and \"dizjpus is yizlpus\" and \"yizlpus is nobtpus\" and \"nobtpus is fuzgpus\" and \"fuzgpus is bekcpus\" and \"bekcpus is cozmpus\" and \"cozmpus is miwlpus\" and \"miwlpus is xijqpus\" and \"xijqpus is raftpus\" and \"raftpus is yezvpus\" and \"yezvpus is lorxpus\" and \"lorxpus is kogkpus\" and \"kogkpus is babcpus\"!\n\nSo from x, we have x is reskpus, and reskpus is jatbpus, but from above, we have a long chain from malfpus to kogkpus, but reskpus is not directly connected to malfpus.\n\nFrom basdpus, we have basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is savfpus, and savfpus contains malfpus, so from basdpus, we can reach malfpus, and then through the chain to kogkpus.\n\nBut x is contained in basdpus? Let's see the containment.\n\nx is reskpus.\n\nreskpus is jatbpus, so reskpus belongs to jatbpus, meaning jatbpus contains reskpus.\n\njatbpus is wafhpus, so jatbpus belongs to wafhpus, meaning wafhpus contains jatbpus.\n\nwafhpus is basdpus, so wafhpus belongs to basdpus, meaning basdpus contains wafhpus.\n\nTherefore, since basdpus contains wafhpus, and wafhpus contains jatbpus, and jatbpus contains reskpus, and reskpus contains x? No.\n\nx is reskpus? The information says \"x is reskpus and ficbpus\" which means x belongs to reskpus and ficbpus, so reskpus contains x.\n\nSo, reskpus contains x, jatbpus contains reskpus, wafhpus contains jatbpus, basdpus contains wafhpus.\n\nTherefore, basdpus contains x indirectly.\n\nNow, basdpus also contains piqrpus, as per \"basdpus is piqrpus and kanppus and zicjpus\" meaning basdpus has members piqrpus, kanppus, zicjpus.\n\nSo piqrpus is a member of basdpus.\n\npiqrpus is savfpus, so piqrpus belongs to savfpus? No, \"piqrpus is savfpus\" means piqrpus belongs to savfpus, so savfpus contains piqrpus.\n\nSimilarly, savfpus is malfpus and qixcpus, so savfpus belongs to malfpus and qixcpus, meaning malfpus contains savfpus and qixcpus contains savfpus.\n\nSo from basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is contained in savfpus, and savfpus is contained in malfpus.\n\nTherefore, malfpus contains savfpus, which contains piqrpus, which is contained in basdpus, so ultimately, malfpus is contained in basdpus? No, containership is transitive but in the opposite direction.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nIf A contains B, and B contains C, then A contains C.\n\nBut here, we have \"A is B\" meaning B contains A.\n\nSo from \"piqrpus is savfpus\" means savfpus contains piqrpus.\n\nAnd \"savfpus is malfpus\" means malfpus contains savfpus.\n\nSo malfpus contains savfpus, and savfpus contains piqrpus, so malfpus contains piqrpus.\n\nBut piqrpus is contained in basdpus? Since \"basdpus is piqrpus\" means basdpus contains piqrpus.\n\nSo basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is contained in savfpus, and savfpus is contained in malfpus, so basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is part of savfpus, but savfpus is contained in malfpus, so from basdpus, we have piqrpus, which is in savfpus, which is in malfpus, so malfpus is not necessarily contained in basdpus; rather, basdpus has piqrpus as a member, and piqrpus is also a member of savfpus, so savfpus contains piqrpus, but savfpus is a member of malfpus, so malfpus contains savfpus.\n\nFor x to be in malfpus, we need x to be contained in malfpus, but x is in basdpus, and basdpus contains piqrpus, but piqrpus is in savfpus, which is in malfpus, so x is not necessarily in malfpus because x is in basdpus, and piqrpus is in basdpus, but x and piqrpus are both members of basdpus, so they are at the same level? Not necessarily, since x is contained in reskpus, which is contained in jatbpus, etc., so x is a deep member of basdpus, while piqrpus is a direct member of basdpus.\n\nTo have x in malfpus, we need a path from x to malfpus.\n\nFrom the chain I mentioned earlier, from malfpus to kogkpus, but we need from x to malfpus.\n\nFrom x, we have x in reskpus, in jatbpus, in wafhpus, in basdpus.\n\nbasdpus has piqrpus as a member, and piqrpus is in savfpus, and savfpus is in malfpus, so if x is piqrpus, then x would be in savfpus and thus in malfpus, but x is not piqrpus; x is reskpus, which is different from piqrpus.\n\nreskpus is jatbpus, and jatbpus is wafhpus, and wafhpus is basdpus, so reskpus is a member of jatbpus, which is member of wafhpus, which is member of basdpus, so reskpus is a member of basdpus indirectly, but piqrpus is also a member of basdpus directly, so reskpus and piqrpus are both members of basdpus, but they are different entities.\n\nTherefore, x is reskpus, which is a member of basdpus, but not necessarily piqrpus, so x is not piqrpus, so we cannot say that x is in savfpus or malfpus.\n\nTherefore, from x, there is no direct link to malfpus through basdpus because x is one member, and piqrpus is another member.\n\nSo the long chain from malfpus to kogkpus does not involve x.\n\nThus, x is not in that chain.\n\nTherefore, x is not contained in kogkpus, and since babcpus contains kogkpus, x is not contained in babcpus.\n\nNow, what about babbpus? babbpus is not mentioned at all, so we have no information about babbpus. Therefore, we cannot say that x is babbpus.\n\nSo, for the question \"x is babbpus or babcpus?\", it is false for babcpus because x is not in babcpus, and unknown for babbpus since no information.\n\nBut the question is \"is it true or false or unknown\", and since it is \"or\", if one is true, it would be true, but neither is true, so it is false? Or since babbpus is unknown, it might be unknown.\n\nBut based on the information, we know that x is not babcpus, so for babcpus, it is false. For babbpus, we don't know, but since the question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus?\", if x is not babcpus, and we don't know about babbpus, then overall, we cannot say it is true, so it might be false or unknown.\n\nBut in logic, if we know that x is not babcpus, and we don't know if x is babbpus, then the statement \"x is babbpus or babcpus\" may be true if x is babbpus, or false if x is not babbpus, but since we don't know, it is unknown.\n\nHowever, in the context, since we have no information about babbpus, it is unknown whether x is babbpus, so the OR statement is unknown.\n\nBut let's confirm if x is babcpus.\n\nFrom above, x is not in the chain to babcpus.\n\nIs there any other way?\n\nFrom the information, we have \"x is reskpus and ficbpus\" and \"reskpus is jatbpus\" and \"jatbpus is wafhpus\" and \"wafhpus is basdpus\" and that's it.\n\nbasdpus is connected to piqrpus, but piqrpus is not x.\n\nSo x is not piqrpus.\n\nTherefore, x is not in the malfpus chain.\n\nHence, x is not contained in kogkpus or babcpus.\n\nSo for babcpus, it is false.\n\nFor babbpus, unknown.\n\nSo the statement \"x is babbpus or babcpus\" is unknown because we don't know about babbpus, but since babcpus is false, if babbpus is false, then false, if true, then true, but we don't know, so unknown.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be unknown.\n\nBut let's make sure there is no other connection.\n\nWe also have \"ficbpus\" for x, but ficbpus is not mentioned anywhere else, so no information.\n\nSimilarly, reskpus is only mentioned as being jatbpus, and no other connections.\n\nSo yes, no link to babcpus.\n\nThus, for babcpus, x is not contained in it.\n\nSo the answer is unknown for the OR statement.\n\nBut the question is to choose true or false or unknown.\n\nSo I think unknown.\n\nBut let's see the note: \"x is reskpus and ficbpus\" meaning x belongs to reskpus and ficbpus, so x is an instance of reskpus.\n\nBut reskpus is a category that contains x, and reskpus is also contained in jatbpus, etc.\n\nBut from the chain, babcpus contains kogkpus, which contains lorxpus, etc., but no overlap with reskpus.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, for the question, it is unknown.",

So x is contained in basdpus.\n\nBut basdpus contains piqrpus, etc., but that doesn't directly link to kogkpus.\n\nNow, where is kogkpus? From \"lorxpus is kogkpus\" and \"yezvpus is lorxpus\" and \"raftpus is yezvpus\" and \"xijqpus is raftpus\" and \"miwlpus is xijqpus\" and \"cozmpus is miwlpus and cuvbpus\" and \"bekcpus is cozmpus and sosmpus\" and \"fuzgpus is bekcpus and qedfpus\" and \"nobtpus is fuzgpus and bosspus\" and \"yizlpus is nobtpus\" and \"dizjpus is yizlpus and zesypus\" and \"gepxpus is dizjpus and sitfpus\" and \"sowgpus is gepxpus\" and \"civmpus is sowgpus and surjpus\" and \"daprpus is civmpus\" and \"faylpus is daprpus and lajjpus\" and \"yoglpus is faylpus and qegfpus\" and \"geqrpus is yoglpus\" and \"tolvpus is geqrpus\" and \"fukspus is tolvpus\" and \"hengpus is fukspus and puqmpus\" and \"vogkpus is hengpus\" and \"yagrpus is vogkpus and peynpus\" and \"tuvkpus is yagrpus and cigfpus\" and \"jokmpus is tuvkpus and zelcpus\" and \"jelspus is jokmpus\" and \"bulrpus is jelspus and siblpus\" and \"fudzpus is bulrpus and tanspus\" and \"malfpus is fudzpus and gumdpus\" and \"savfpus is malfpus and qixcpus\" and \"piqrpus is savfpus\" and we have piqrpus is contained in basdpus, but from above, basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is savfpus, etc., but this is a long chain, and we have kogkpus on the other side.\n\nBut from kogkpus, we have \"lorxpus is kogkpus\" so kogkpus contains lorxpus, and lorxpus contains yezvpus? No, \"yezvpus is lorxpus\" so yezvpus belongs to lorxpus, so lorxpus contains yezvpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"raftpus is yezvpus\" so raftpus belongs to yezvpus, so yezvpus contains raftpus.\n\nBut from the chain, we have xijqpus is raftpus, so xijqpus belongs to raftpus, so raftpus contains xijqpus.\n\nBut xijqpus is also contained in miwlpus? \"miwlpus is xijqpus\" so miwlpus belongs to xijqpus? Let's clarify.\n\n\"miwlpus is xijqpus\" means miwlpus belongs to xijqpus, so xijqpus contains miwlpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"cozmpus is miwlpus and cuvbpus\" so cozmpus belongs to miwlpus and cuvbpus, so miwlpus contains cozmpus, and cuvbpus contains cozmpus.\n\nBut for x, we are far from this.\n\nx is in basdpus, and basdpus contains piqrpus, which is savfpus, which contains malfpus, etc., but this chain doesn't seem to connect to kogkpus.\n\nPerhaps there is another way.\n\nWe also have \"yezvpus is lorxpus\" and \"raftpus is yezvpus\" but from \"xijqpus is raftpus\" and \"miwlpus is xijqpus\" but miwlpus is part of cozmpus, which is part of bekcpus, etc., but no direct link to x.\n\nx is reskpus, which is jatbpus, which is wafhpus, which is basdpus.\n\nNow, is basdpus related to kogkpus? From \"lorxpus is kogkpus\" and \"yezvpus is lorxpus\" but yezvpus is also mentioned in \"raftpus is yezvpus\" and from \"xijqpus is raftpus\" but xijqpus is also mentioned in \"miwlpus is xijqpus\" and \"cozmpus is miwlpus\" but cozmpus is in bekcpus, etc.\n\nBut let's see if there is a common category.\n\nNotice that \"basdpus is piqrpus and kanppus and zicjpus\" and piqrpus is savfpus, etc., but also, from \"zahwpus is guxjpus\" and \"tannpus is zahwpus and sunppus\" and \"rexjpus is tannpus\" and \"fudzpus is rexjpus\" but fudzpus is also in malfpus, etc.\n\nBut for kogkpus, we have \"lorxpus is kogkpus\" and \"yezvpus is lorxpus\" and from \"raftpus is yezvpus\" but also from the information, \"raftpus is sumwpus\" and \"raftpus is yezvpus\" so raftpus belongs to both sumwpus and yezvpus? That might be possible.\n\nBut from x, we need to see if x is in the chain that leads to kogkpus.\n\nAnother thought: from \"reskpus is jatbpus\" and \"wafhpus is basdpus\" but also from \"basdpus is piqrpus\" and \"piqrpus is savfpus\" and \"savfpus is malfpus\" and \"malfpus is fudzpus\" and \"fudzpus is bulrpus\" and \"bulrpus is jelspus\" and \"jelspus is jokmpus\" and \"jokmpus is tuvkpus\" and \"tuvkpus is yagrpus\" and \"yagrpus is vogkpus\" and \"vogkpus is hengpus\" and \"hengpus is fukspus\" and \"fukspus is tolvpus\" and \"tolvpus is geqrpus\" and \"geqrpus is yoglpus\" and \"yoglpus is faylpus\" and \"faylpus is daprpus\" and \"daprpus is civmpus\" and \"civmpus is sowgpus\" and \"sowgpus is gepxpus\" and \"gepxpus is dizjpus\" and \"dizjpus is yizlpus\" and \"yizlpus is nobtpus\" and \"nobtpus is fuzgpus\" and \"fuzgpus is bekcpus\" and \"bekcpus is cozmpus\" and \"cozmpus is miwlpus\" and \"miwlpus is xijqpus\" and \"xijqpus is raftpus\" and \"raftpus is yezvpus\" and \"yezvpus is lorxpus\" and \"lorxpus is kogkpus\" and \"kogkpus is babcpus\"!\n\nSo from x, we have x is reskpus, and reskpus is jatbpus, but from above, we have a long chain from malfpus to kogkpus, but reskpus is not directly connected to malfpus.\n\nFrom basdpus, we have basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is savfpus, and savfpus contains malfpus, so from basdpus, we can reach malfpus, and then through the chain to kogkpus.\n\nBut x is contained in basdpus? Let's see the containment.\n\nx is reskpus.\n\nreskpus is jatbpus, so reskpus belongs to jatbpus, meaning jatbpus contains reskpus.\n\njatbpus is wafhpus, so jatbpus belongs to wafhpus, meaning wafhpus contains jatbpus.\n\nwafhpus is basdpus, so wafhpus belongs to basdpus, meaning basdpus contains wafhpus.\n\nTherefore, since basdpus contains wafhpus, and wafhpus contains jatbpus, and jatbpus contains reskpus, and reskpus contains x? No.\n\nx is reskpus? The information says \"x is reskpus and ficbpus\" which means x belongs to reskpus and ficbpus, so reskpus contains x.\n\nSo, reskpus contains x, jatbpus contains reskpus, wafhpus contains jatbpus, basdpus contains wafhpus.\n\nTherefore, basdpus contains x indirectly.\n\nNow, basdpus also contains piqrpus, as per \"basdpus is piqrpus and kanppus and zicjpus\" meaning basdpus has members piqrpus, kanppus, zicjpus.\n\nSo piqrpus is a member of basdpus.\n\npiqrpus is savfpus, so piqrpus belongs to savfpus? No, \"piqrpus is savfpus\" means piqrpus belongs to savfpus, so savfpus contains piqrpus.\n\nSimilarly, savfpus is malfpus and qixcpus, so savfpus belongs to malfpus and qixcpus, meaning malfpus contains savfpus and qixcpus contains savfpus.\n\nSo from basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is contained in savfpus, and savfpus is contained in malfpus.\n\nTherefore, malfpus contains savfpus, which contains piqrpus, which is contained in basdpus, so ultimately, malfpus is contained in basdpus? No, containership is transitive but in the opposite direction.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nIf A contains B, and B contains C, then A contains C.\n\nBut here, we have \"A is B\" meaning B contains A.\n\nSo from \"piqrpus is savfpus\" means savfpus contains piqrpus.\n\nAnd \"savfpus is malfpus\" means malfpus contains savfpus.\n\nSo malfpus contains savfpus, and savfpus contains piqrpus, so malfpus contains piqrpus.\n\nBut piqrpus is contained in basdpus? Since \"basdpus is piqrpus\" means basdpus contains piqrpus.\n\nSo basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is contained in savfpus, and savfpus is contained in malfpus, so basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is part of savfpus, but savfpus is contained in malfpus, so from basdpus, we have piqrpus, which is in savfpus, which is in malfpus, so malfpus is not necessarily contained in basdpus; rather, basdpus has piqrpus as a member, and piqrpus is also a member of savfpus, so savfpus contains piqrpus, but savfpus is a member of malfpus, so malfpus contains savfpus.\n\nFor x to be in malfpus, we need x to be contained in malfpus, but x is in basdpus, and basdpus contains piqrpus, but piqrpus is in savfpus, which is in malfpus, so x is not necessarily in malfpus because x is in basdpus, and piqrpus is in basdpus, but x and piqrpus are both members of basdpus, so they are at the same level? Not necessarily, since x is contained in reskpus, which is contained in jatbpus, etc., so x is a deep member of basdpus, while piqrpus is a direct member of basdpus.\n\nTo have x in malfpus, we need a path from x to malfpus.\n\nFrom the chain I mentioned earlier, from malfpus to kogkpus, but we need from x to malfpus.\n\nFrom x, we have x in reskpus, in jatbpus, in wafhpus, in basdpus.\n\nbasdpus has piqrpus as a member, and piqrpus is in savfpus, and savfpus is in malfpus, so if x is piqrpus, then x would be in savfpus and thus in malfpus, but x is not piqrpus; x is reskpus, which is different from piqrpus.\n\nreskpus is jatbpus, and jatbpus is wafhpus, and wafhpus is basdpus, so reskpus is a member of jatbpus, which is member of wafhpus, which is member of basdpus, so reskpus is a member of basdpus indirectly, but piqrpus is also a member of basdpus directly, so reskpus and piqrpus are both members of basdpus, but they are different entities.\n\nTherefore, x is reskpus, which is a member of basdpus, but not necessarily piqrpus, so x is not piqrpus, so we cannot say that x is in savfpus or malfpus.\n\nTherefore, from x, there is no direct link to malfpus through basdpus because x is one member, and piqrpus is another member.\n\nSo the long chain from malfpus to kogkpus does not involve x.\n\nThus, x is not in that chain.\n\nTherefore, x is not contained in kogkpus, and since babcpus contains kogkpus, x is not contained in babcpus.\n\nNow, what about babbpus? babbpus is not mentioned at all, so we have no information about babbpus. Therefore, we cannot say that x is babbpus.\n\nSo, for the question \"x is babbpus or babcpus?\", it is false for babcpus because x is not in babcpus, and unknown for babbpus since no information.\n\nBut the question is \"is it true or false or unknown\", and since it is \"or\", if one is true, it would be true, but neither is true, so it is false? Or since babbpus is unknown, it might be unknown.\n\nBut based on the information, we know that x is not babcpus, so for babcpus, it is false. For babbpus, we don't know, but since the question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus?\", if x is not babcpus, and we don't know about babbpus, then overall, we cannot say it is true, so it might be false or unknown.\n\nBut in logic, if we know that x is not babcpus, and we don't know if x is babbpus, then the statement \"x is babbpus or babcpus\" may be true if x is babbpus, or false if x is not babbpus, but since we don't know, it is unknown.\n\nHowever, in the context, since we have no information about babbpus, it is unknown whether x is babbpus, so the OR statement is unknown.\n\nBut let's confirm if x is babcpus.\n\nFrom above, x is not in the chain to babcpus.\n\nIs there any other way?\n\nFrom the information, we have \"x is reskpus and ficbpus\" and \"reskpus is jatbpus\" and \"jatbpus is wafhpus\" and \"wafhpus is basdpus\" and that's it.\n\nbasdpus is connected to piqrpus, but piqrpus is not x.\n\nSo x is not piqrpus.\n\nTherefore, x is not in the malfpus chain.\n\nHence, x is not contained in kogkpus or babcpus.\n\nSo for babcpus, it is false.\n\nFor babbpus, unknown.\n\nSo the statement \"x is babbpus or babcpus\" is unknown because we don't know about babbpus, but since babcpus is false, if babbpus is false, then false, if true, then true, but we don't know, so unknown.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be unknown.\n\nBut let's make sure there is no other connection.\n\nWe also have \"ficbpus\" for x, but ficbpus is not mentioned anywhere else, so no information.\n\nSimilarly, reskpus is only mentioned as being jatbpus, and no other connections.\n\nSo yes, no link to babcpus.\n\nThus, for babcpus, x is not contained in it.\n\nSo the answer is unknown for the OR statement.\n\nBut the question is to choose true or false or unknown.\n\nSo I think unknown.\n\nBut let's see the note: \"x is reskpus and ficbpus\" meaning x belongs to reskpus and ficbpus, so x is an instance of reskpus.\n\nBut reskpus is a category that contains x, and reskpus is also contained in jatbpus, etc.\n\nBut from the chain, babcpus contains kogkpus, which contains lorxpus, etc., but no overlap with reskpus.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, for the question, it is unknown.",

    "So piqrpus is a member of basdpus.",
    "piqrpus is savfpus, so piqrpus belongs to savfpus?",
    "No, \"piqrpus is savfpus\" means piqrpus belongs to savfpus, so savfpus contains piqrpus.",
    "Similarly, savfpus is malfpus and qixcpus, so savfpus belongs to malfpus and qixcpus, meaning malfpus contains savfpus and qixcpus contains savfpus.",
    "So from basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is contained in savfpus, and savfpus is contained in malfpus.",
    "Therefore, malfpus contains savfpus, which contains piqrpus, which is contained in basdpus, so ultimately, malfpus is contained in basdpus?",
    "No, containership is transitive but in the opposite direction.",
    "Let's think carefully.",
    "If A contains B, and B contains C, then A contains C.",
    "But here, we have \"A is B\" meaning B contains A.",
    "So from \"piqrpus is savfpus\" means savfpus contains piqrpus.",
    "And \"savfpus is malfpus\" means malfpus contains savfpus.",
    "So malfpus contains savfpus, and savfpus contains piqrpus, so malfpus contains piqrpus.",
    "But piqrpus is contained in basdpus?",
    "Since \"basdpus is piqrpus\" means basdpus contains piqrpus.",
    "So basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is contained in savfpus, and savfpus is contained in malfpus, so basdpus contains piqrpus, and piqrpus is part of savfpus, but savfpus is contained in malfpus, so from basdpus, we have piqrpus, which is in savfpus, which is in malfpus, so malfpus is not necessarily contained in basdpus; rather, basdpus has piqrpus as a member, and piqrpus is also a member of savfpus, so savfpus contains piqrpus, but savfpus is a member of malfpus, so malfpus contains savfpus.",
    "For x to be in malfpus, we need x to be contained in malfpus, but x is in basdpus, and basdpus contains piqrpus, but piqrpus is in savfpus, which is in malfpus, so x is not necessarily in malfpus because x is in basdpus, and piqrpus is in basdpus, but x and piqrpus are both members of basdpus, so they are at the same level?",
    "Not necessarily, since x is contained in reskpus, which is contained in jatbpus, etc.",
    ", so x is a deep member of basdpus, while piqrpus is a direct member of basdpus.",
    "To have x in malfpus, we need a path from x to malfpus.",
    "From the chain I mentioned earlier, from malfpus to kogkpus, but we need from x to malfpus.",
    "From x, we have x in reskpus, in jatbpus, in wafhpus, in basdpus.",
    "basdpus has piqrpus as a member, and piqrpus is in savfpus, and savfpus is in malfpus, so if x is piqrpus, then x would be in savfpus and thus in malfpus, but x is not piqrpus; x is reskpus, which is different from piqrpus.",
    "reskpus is jatbpus, and jatbpus is wafhpus, and wafhpus is basdpus, so reskpus is a member of jatbpus, which is member of wafhpus, which is member of basdpus, so reskpus is a member of basdpus indirectly, but piqrpus is also a member of basdpus directly, so reskpus and piqrpus are both members of basdpus, but they are different entities.",
    "Therefore, x is reskpus, which is a member of basdpus, but not necessarily piqrpus, so x is not piqrpus, so we cannot say that x is in savfpus or malfpus.",
    "Therefore, from x, there is no direct link to malfpus through basdpus because x is one member, and piqrpus is another member.",
    "So the long chain from malfpus to kogkpus does not involve x.",
    "Thus, x is not in that chain.",
    "Therefore, x is not contained in kogkpus, and since babcpus contains kogkpus, x is not contained in babcpus.",
    "Now, what about babbpus?",
    "babbpus is not mentioned at all, so we have no information about babbpus.",
    "Therefore, we cannot say that x is babbpus.",
    "So, for the question \"x is babbpus or babcpus?",
    "\", it is false for babcpus because x is not in babcpus, and unknown for babbpus since no information.",
    "But the question is \"is it true or false or unknown\", and since it is \"or\", if one is true, it would be true, but neither is true, so it is false?",
    "Or since babbpus is unknown, it might be unknown.",
    "But based on the information, we know that x is not babcpus, so for babcpus, it is false.",
    "For babbpus, we don't know, but since the question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus?",
    "\", if x is not babcpus, and we don't know about babbpus, then overall, we cannot say it is true, so it might be false or unknown.",
    "But in logic, if we know that x is not babcpus, and we don't know if x is babbpus, then the statement \"x is babbpus or babcpus\" may be true if x is babbpus, or false if x is not babbpus, but since we don't know, it is unknown.",
    "However, in the context, since we have no information about babbpus, it is unknown whether x is babbpus, so the OR statement is unknown.",
    "But let's confirm if x is babcpus.",
    "From above, x is not in the chain to babcpus.",
    "Is there any other way?",
    "From the information, we have \"x is reskpus and ficbpus\" and \"reskpus is jatbpus\" and \"jatbpus is wafhpus\" and \"wafhpus is basdpus\" and that's it.",
    "basdpus is connected to piqrpus, but piqrpus is not x.",
    "So x is not piqrpus.",
    "Therefore, x is not in the malfpus chain.",
    "Hence, x is not contained in kogkpus or babcpus.",
    "So for babcpus, it is false.",
    "For babbpus, unknown.",
    "So the statement \"x is babbpus or babcpus\" is unknown because we don't know about babbpus, but since babcpus is false, if babbpus is false, then false, if true, then true, but we don't know, so unknown.",
    "Therefore, the answer should be unknown.",
    "But let's make sure there is no other connection.",
    "We also have \"ficbpus\" for x, but ficbpus is not mentioned anywhere else, so no information.",
    "Similarly, reskpus is only mentioned as being jatbpus, and no other connections.",
    "So yes, no link to babcpus.",
    "Thus, for babcpus, x is not contained in it.",
    "So the answer is unknown for the OR statement.",
    "But the question is to choose true or false or unknown.",
    "So I think unknown.",
    "But let's see the note: \"x is reskpus and ficbpus\" meaning x belongs to reskpus and ficbpus, so x is an instance of reskpus.",
    "But reskpus is a category that contains x, and reskpus is also contained in jatbpus, etc.",
    "But from the chain, babcpus contains kogkpus, which contains lorxpus, etc.",
    ", but no overlap with reskpus.",
    "So yes.",
    "Therefore, for the question, it is unknown."

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo yes.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

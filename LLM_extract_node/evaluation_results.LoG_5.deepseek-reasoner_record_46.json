  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the relationships. The statements are like \"A is B\" which means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, it's a hierarchical or categorical relationship.\n\nI need to find out if x is both babcpus and babrpus. x is given as hebfpus in one statement: \"x is hebfpus\". But from another statement, \"hebfpus is lelnpus\", and \"lelnpus is vujxpus\", and \"vujxpus is gevmpus\", and \"gevmpus is panjpus\", and \"panjpus is hufqpus and wivrpus\". Also, \"hufqpus is cubnpus\", and \"cubnpus is zocnpus and gidjpus\", and \"zocnpus is zaqdpus\", and \"zaqdpus is babcpus and nidfpus\". So, if I trace this, x should be under babcpus because zaqdpus is babcpus, and zocnpus is zaqdpus, and so on up to x.\n\nLet me list out the chain for x:\n\nFrom \"x is hebfpus\" and \"hebfpus is lelnpus\", so x is lelnpus.\n\n\"lelnpus is vujxpus\", so x is vujxpus.\n\n\"vujxpus is gevmpus\", so x is gevmpus.\n\n\"gevmpus is panjpus\", so x is panjpus.\n\n\"panjpus is hufqpus and wivrpus\" – this means panjpus contains hufqpus and wivrpus, so since x is panjpus, it might be part of hufqpus or wivrpus? But actually, since \"is\" means belongs to, if x is panjpus, and panjpus has hufqpus and wivrpus, that might imply that x is one of them or contained in them? I need to be careful.\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, if A is B, and B is C, then A is C. So, it's transitive. So, from above, x is hebfpus, hebfpus is lelnpus, so x is lelnpus, and so on. So, eventually, x is panjpus.\n\nBut panjpus is hufqpus and wivrpus – this might mean that panjpus consists of hufqpus and wivrpus, or that hufqpus and wivrpus are subcategories of panjpus. So, if x is panjpus, it doesn't necessarily mean that x is hufqpus or wivrpus; it might mean that x is the category itself, but since x is a specific thing, probably x is an instance that belongs to panjpus, and since panjpus contains hufqpus, x might belong to hufqpus or something. But let's see the statements.\n\nActually, from the statements, we have things like \"zocnpus is zaqdpus\" which means zocnpus belongs to zaqdpus, so zaqdpus is a broader category. Similarly, \"zaqdpus is babcpus and nidfpus\" – this might mean that zaqdpus is part of babcpus and nidfpus, or that babcpus and nidfpus are categories that contain zaqdpus? The phrasing is ambiguous.\n\nLet's look at the note: \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B. So, if A is B, then B is a category that contains A.\n\nBut when we say \"B is C and D\", it might mean that B belongs to both C and D, or that B is composed of C and D? The note doesn't specify how to handle multiple categories.\n\nFrom examples: \"qehppus is babrpus and laybpus\" – this means qehppus belongs to babrpus and also to laybpus? Or does it mean that qehppus is contained in both? Similarly, \"yecbpus is hovrpus and wedkpus\" meaning yecbpus belongs to hovrpus and wedkpus.\n\nAlso, \"panjpus is hufqpus and wivrpus\" – so panjpus belongs to hufqpus and wivrpus? That seems odd because later we have \"hufqpus is cubnpus\" and \"cubnpus is zocnpus\" etc., so if panjpus belongs to hufqpus, but hufqpus is cubnpus, which is lower, so panjpus would be under hufqpus, but from the chain, we have gevmpus is panjpus, and vujxpus is gevmpus, etc., so panjpus is above in the chain, but if panjpus is hufqpus, that would mean panjpus belongs to hufqpus, which would contradict if hufqpus is under panjpus.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"panjpus is hufqpus and wivrpus\" – according to the meaning, this means panjpus belongs to hufqpus and also to wivrpus. But from earlier, we have \"gevmpus is panjpus\" so gevmpus belongs to panjpus, and \"vujxpus is gevmpus\" so vujxpus belongs to gevmpus, so vujxpus belongs to panjpus. But if panjpus belongs to hufqpus, then vujxpus belongs to hufqpus, which is consistent because \"hufqpus is cubnpus\" and so on.\n\nBut also, \"hufqpus is cubnpus\" means hufqpus belongs to cubnpus, so if panjpus belongs to hufqpus, then panjpus belongs to cubnpus, but from \"cubnpus is zocnpus and gidjpus\" so cubnpus belongs to zocnpus, so panjpus belongs to zocnpus, but from \"zocnpus is zaqdpus\" so zocnpus belongs to zaqdpus, and \"zaqdpus is babcpus and nidfpus\" so zaqdpus belongs to babcpus, so ultimately, panjpus belongs to babcpus.\n\nBut we have x is panjpus, so x belongs to panjpus, and since panjpus belongs to babcpus, x belongs to babcpus? Not necessarily: if A belongs to B, and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C? Only if the relation is transitive, which it seems to be from the note. The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if A is B and B is C, then A is C, so yes, it is transitive.\n\nSo, for x to be babcpus, we need to see if x is in the chain to babcpus.\n\nSimilarly for babrpus.\n\nFirst, let's establish what x is. From the statements: \"x is hebfpus\" and \"hebfpus is lelnpus\" so x is lelnpus.\n\nAlso, from \"x is joknpus and pomcpus\" – wait, there is another statement: \"x is joknpus and pomcpus\"? Let's see: from the given information: \"x is hebfpus\" is one statement, and then \"x is joknpus and pomcpus\" is another? Let's read all given information.\n\nThe given information has: \"x is hebfpus.\" which is separate, and then later \"x is joknpus and pomcpus.\"? No, let's list all statements:\n\n- zocnpus is zaqdpus.\n\n- joknpus is jeswpus.\n\n- qehppus is babrpus and laybpus.\n\n- yecbpus is hovrpus and wedkpus.\n\n- lelnpus is vujxpus.\n\n- x is hebfpus.  // so x is hebfpus\n\n- gevmpus is panjpus.\n\n- cubnpus is zocnpus and gidjpus.\n\n- jehvpus is wepppus.\n\n- wepppus is jownpus and xadxpus.\n\n- hebfpus is lelnpus.  // so since x is hebfpus, x is lelnpus\n\n- vujxpus is gevmpus.  // and lelnpus is vujxpus, so lelnpus is gevmpus, so x is gevmpus\n\n- hufqpus is cubnpus.\n\n- zaqdpus is babcpus and nidfpus.\n\n- jownpus is yecbpus.\n\n- hovrpus is qehppus and berfpus.\n\n- panjpus is hufqpus and wivrpus.  // but gevmpus is panjpus, so gevmpus is hufqpus and wivrpus? Since gevmpus is panjpus and panjpus is hufqpus, so gevmpus is hufqpus? Similarly, gevmpus is wivrpus.\n\nBut from above, x is gevmpus, so x is hufqpus and x is wivrpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom transitivity: if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nSo, x is hebfpus, hebfpus is lelnpus, so x is lelnpus.\n\nlelnpus is vujxpus, so x is vujxpus.\n\nvujxpus is gevmpus, so x is gevmpus.\n\ngevmpus is panjpus, so x is panjpus.\n\nNow, panjpus is hufqpus and wivrpus. This means that panjpus belongs to hufqpus and also to wivrpus. So, since x is panjpus, x belongs to panjpus, but panjpus belongs to hufqpus, so x belongs to hufqpus? Is that correct?\n\nIf x is panjpus, that means x is an instance of panjpus or x is contained in panjpus. But panjpus itself belongs to hufqpus, so the category panjpus is contained in hufqpus, so any instance of panjpus is also contained in hufqpus? Yes, because if panjpus is a subset of hufqpus, then all elements of panjpus are in hufqpus.\n\nSo, from x is panjpus and panjpus is hufqpus, then x is hufqpus.\n\nSimilarly, panjpus is wivrpus, so x is wivrpus.\n\nSo, x is hufqpus.\n\nNow, hufqpus is cubnpus? From \"hufqpus is cubnpus\" so hufqpus belongs to cubnpus, so since x is hufqpus, x is cubnpus.\n\ncubnpus is zocnpus and gidjpus? \"cubnpus is zocnpus and gidjpus\" means cubnpus belongs to zocnpus and also to gidjpus? So, since x is cubnpus, x is zocnpus and x is gidjpus.\n\nzocnpus is zaqdpus, so x is zaqdpus.\n\nzaqdpus is babcpus and nidfpus, so zaqdpus belongs to babcpus and nidfpus, so since x is zaqdpus, x is babcpus and x is nidfpus.\n\nSo, from this chain, x is babcpus.\n\nNow, we need to see if x is babrpus.\n\nbabrpus is mentioned in \"qehppus is babrpus and laybpus\" so qehppus belongs to babrpus.\n\nAlso, \"hovrpus is qehppus and berfpus\" so hovrpus belongs to qehppus and berfpus.\n\nAnd \"jownpus is yecbpus\" and \"yecbpus is hovrpus and wedkpus\" so yecbpus belongs to hovrpus and wedkpus.\n\nBut we have x is joknpus? From another statement: \"x is joknpus and pomcpus\"? Wait, I think I missed that.\n\nIn the given information, after \"vujxpus is gevmpus.\" there is \"hufqpus is cubnpus.\" and then \"zaqdpus is babcpus and nidfpus.\" and then \"jownpus is yecbpus.\" and then \"hovrpus is qehppus and berfpus.\" and then \"panjpus is hufqpus and wivrpus.\" and then \"x is joknpus and pomcpus.\"? Let's see the text:\n\n\"gevmpus is panjpus. cubnpus is zocnpus and gidjpus. jehvpus is wepppus. wepppus is jownpus and xadxpus. hebfpus is lelnpus. vujxpus is gevmpus. hufqpus is cubnpus. zaqdpus is babcpus and nidfpus. jownpus is yecbpus. hovrpus is qehppus and berfpus. panjpus is hufqpus and wivrpus. x is joknpus and pomcpus. jeswpus is jehvpus. \"\n\nYes, there is a statement: \"x is joknpus and pomcpus.\" So, x belongs to joknpus and also to pomcpus.\n\nBut we already have x is hebfpus from earlier, and we traced that to babcpus.\n\nNow, from x is joknpus, we can trace joknpus.\n\njoknpus is jeswpus? From \"joknpus is jeswpus\" so x is jeswpus? Since x is joknpus and joknpus is jeswpus, so x is jeswpus.\n\njeswpus is jehvpus? From \"jeswpus is jehvpus\" so x is jehvpus.\n\njehvpus is wepppus? From \"jehvpus is wepppus\" so x is wepppus.\n\nwepppus is jownpus and xadxpus? So wepppus belongs to jownpus and xadxpus, so since x is wepppus, x is jownpus and x is xadxpus.\n\njownpus is yecbpus?

So hovrpus belongs to qehppus and berfpus, so x is qehppus and x is berfpus.\n\nqehppus is babrpus and laybpus? So qehppus belongs to babrpus and laybpus, so since x is qehppus, x is babrpus and x is laybpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babrpus.\n\nSo, from both chains, x is babcpus and x is babrpus.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babcpus and babrpus.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any contradiction or missing link.\n\nWe have two ways: from the hebfpus chain, we got x is babcpus, and from the joknpus chain, we got x is babrpus.\n\nAlso, note that x is pomcpus from \"x is joknpus and pomcpus\" but we didn't use pomcpus for anything, so it's fine.\n\nSo, overall, x is both babcpus and babrpus.\n\nThus, the answer should be true.",

    "But panjpus is hufqpus and wivrpus – this might mean that panjpus consists of hufqpus and wivrpus, or that hufqpus and wivrpus are subcategories of panjpus.",
    "So, if x is panjpus, it doesn't necessarily mean that x is hufqpus or wivrpus; it might mean that x is the category itself, but since x is a specific thing, probably x is an instance that belongs to panjpus, and since panjpus contains hufqpus, x might belong to hufqpus or something.",
    "But let's see the statements.",
    "Actually, from the statements, we have things like \"zocnpus is zaqdpus\" which means zocnpus belongs to zaqdpus, so zaqdpus is a broader category.",
    "Similarly, \"zaqdpus is babcpus and nidfpus\" – this might mean that zaqdpus is part of babcpus and nidfpus, or that babcpus and nidfpus are categories that contain zaqdpus?",
    "The phrasing is ambiguous.",
    "Let's look at the note: \"A is B\" means A belongs to B or A is contained in B.",
    "So, if A is B, then B is a category that contains A.",
    "But when we say \"B is C and D\", it might mean that B belongs to both C and D, or that B is composed of C and D?",
    "The note doesn't specify how to handle multiple categories.",
    "From examples: \"qehppus is babrpus and laybpus\" – this means qehppus belongs to babrpus and also to laybpus?",
    "Or does it mean that qehppus is contained in both?",
    "Similarly, \"yecbpus is hovrpus and wedkpus\" meaning yecbpus belongs to hovrpus and wedkpus.",
    "Also, \"panjpus is hufqpus and wivrpus\" – so panjpus belongs to hufqpus and wivrpus?",

    ", so panjpus is above in the chain, but if panjpus is hufqpus, that would mean panjpus belongs to hufqpus, which would contradict if hufqpus is under panjpus.",
    "Let's read carefully: \"panjpus is hufqpus and wivrpus\" – according to the meaning, this means panjpus belongs to hufqpus and also to wivrpus.",
    "But from earlier, we have \"gevmpus is panjpus\" so gevmpus belongs to panjpus, and \"vujxpus is gevmpus\" so vujxpus belongs to gevmpus, so vujxpus belongs to panjpus.",
    "But if panjpus belongs to hufqpus, then vujxpus belongs to hufqpus, which is consistent because \"hufqpus is cubnpus\" and so on.",
    "But also, \"hufqpus is cubnpus\" means hufqpus belongs to cubnpus, so if panjpus belongs to hufqpus, then panjpus belongs to cubnpus, but from \"cubnpus is zocnpus and gidjpus\" so cubnpus belongs to zocnpus, so panjpus belongs to zocnpus, but from \"zocnpus is zaqdpus\" so zocnpus belongs to zaqdpus, and \"zaqdpus is babcpus and nidfpus\" so zaqdpus belongs to babcpus, so ultimately, panjpus belongs to babcpus.",
    "But we have x is panjpus, so x belongs to panjpus, and since panjpus belongs to babcpus, x belongs to babcpus?",

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nThus, the answer should be true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

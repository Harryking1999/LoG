  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus. From the given information, x is defined as gatspus. So, x = gatspus.\n\nNow, I need to see if gatspus is connected to babgpus in any way. Looking at the information, I see that babgpus is mentioned in the context of cenmpus: \"cenmpus is babgpus and yarypus and darhpus.\" So cenmpus contains babgpus.\n\nBut I need to get from gatspus to cenmpus or directly to babgpus.\n\nI know that gatspus is jocbpus: \"gatspus is jocbpus.\"\n\nAnd jocbpus is midjpus and wulppus: \"jocbpus is midjpus and wulppus.\"\n\nmidjpus is relnpus: \"midjpus is relnpus.\"\n\nrelnpus is zafypus: \"relnpus is zafypus.\"\n\nzafypus is lupgpus: \"zafypus is lupgpus.\"\n\nlupgpus is nixqpus and cayrpus: \"lupgpus is nixqpus and cayrpus.\"\n\nnixqpus is haxfpus: \"nixqpus is haxfpus.\"\n\nhaxfpus is xomcpus and yeghpus: \"haxfpus is xomcpus and yeghpus.\"\n\nxomcpus is vejvpus: \"xomcpus is vejvpus.\"\n\nvejvpus is govrpus and xoqppus: \"vejvpus is govrpus and xoqppus.\"\n\ngovrpus is pabppus and qaxmpus: \"govrpus is pabppus and qaxmpus.\" Also, \"govrpus is foxnpus.\" But that might be redundant or multiple categories.\n\nI need to find a path to cenmpus since cenmpus has babgpus.\n\nI also see that soklpus is cenmpus: \"soklpus is cenmpus.\"\n\nAnd xojqpus is soklpus: \"xojqpus is soklpus.\"\n\nBut from earlier, I have vijdpus is xojqpus: \"vijdpus is xojqpus.\"\n\nAnd refkpus is vijdpus: \"refkpus is vijdpus.\"\n\nAnd dubjpus is refkpus: \"dubjpus is refkpus.\"\n\nBut I need to get to gatspus, which is jocbpus, and jocbpus is midjpus, which is relnpus, which is zafypus, which is lupgpus, etc. This seems long and might not connect directly to cenmpus.\n\nI recall that from dubjpus, there might be another path. But let's see if there's a shorter way.\n\nI have x = gatspus = jocbpus = midjpus = relnpus = zafypus = lupgpus\n\nlupgpus is nixqpus and cayrpus. nixqpus is haxfpus, which is xomcpus and yeghpus. xomcpus is vejvpus, which is govrpus and xoqppus. govrpus is pabppus and qaxmpus, and also foxnpus. foxnpus is rarzpus and nozgpus. rarzpus is gohspus. gohspus is hobfpus and nelxpus. hobfpus is dovvpus, and also hobfpus is qugnpus and colqpus. dovvpus is kurbpus. This doesn't seem to lead to cenmpus.\n\nPerhaps from lupgpus, cayrpus might lead somewhere, but cayrpus isn't defined further.\n\nI need to consider another approach. I have soklpus is cenmpus, and xojqpus is soklpus, and vijdpus is xojqpus, but how do I connect to gatspus?\n\nFrom jocbpus, which is gatspus, jocbpus is also wulppus, but wulppus isn't defined, so I might only have midjpus to work with.\n\nmidjpus is relnpus, which is zafypus, which is lupgpus. But lupgpus doesn't directly connect to soklpus or cenmpus.\n\nI see that celkpus is xoxlpus, and xoxlpus is fihppus, but that might not help.\n\nAnother thing: vigbpus is yutmpus and giccpus, but vigbpus is part of vupvpus, which is buywpus, but buywpus is vupvpus, and sigtpus is buywpus and yugzpus, but that seems unrelated.\n\nI need to find if there's a chain from gatspus to babgpus.\n\nLet's list all the relationships that involve babgpus. babgpus is only mentioned in cenmpus: \"cenmpus is babgpus and yarypus and darhpus.\"\n\nAnd soklpus is cenmpus: \"soklpus is cenmpus.\"\n\nAnd xojqpus is soklpus: \"xojqpus is soklpus.\"\n\nNow, who is xojqpus? From the information, vijdpus is xojqpus: \"vijdpus is xojqpus.\"\n\nAlso, vijdpus is celkpus: \"vijdpus is celkpus.\" But that might be multiple things, or perhaps vijdpus has multiple categories.\n\nThe note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so A can be in multiple categories.\n\nSo vijdpus is xojqpus and also celkpus.\n\nBut celkpus is xoxlpus: \"celkpus is xoxlpus.\"\n\nxoxlpus is fihppus: \"xoxlpus is fihppus.\"\n\nfihppus is matkpus: \"fihppus is matkpus.\" But matkpus isn't defined further, so this might not help.\n\nFrom vijdpus, we also have refkpus is vijdpus: \"refkpus is vijdpus.\"\n\nAnd dubjpus is refkpus: \"dubjpus is refkpus.\"\n\nAnd qinvpus is dubjpus and risjpus: \"qinvpus is dubjpus and risjpus.\"\n\nAnd zoqkpus is nujrpus and howkpus: \"zoqkpus is nujrpus and howkpus.\" But nujrpus is qinvpus: \"nujrpus is qinvpus.\"\n\nAlso, lowxpus is zoqkpus: \"lowxpus is zoqkpus.\"\n\nAnd lowxpus is dolnpus: \"lowxpus is dolnpus.\" But also, kojypus is lowxpus and kumdpus, and mayppus is kojypus, and hanspus is mayppus and bijqpus, and bilgpus is hanspus, and setmpus is bilgpus and qejrpus and lofbpus, and lopdpus is setmpus, and gofdpus is lopdpus, and gactpus is gofdpus, and cebnpus is gactpus, and dahtpus is cebnpus and misrpus, and nohnpus is dahtpus and tujcpus and pihvpus and deztpus, and zumcpus is nohnpus, and tixzpus is zumcpus and faprpus, and volppus is tixzpus, and dojvpus is volppus and suhlpus, and jozbpus is dojvpus and keflpus, and kirdpus is jozbpus and supmpus, and qokmpus is kirdpus and sirhpus, and timhpus is qokmpus and hohbpus and regypus, and hiwrpus is timhpus, and wipspus is hiwrpus and jokypus, and vayzpus is wipspus, and gifmpus is vayzpus and markpus and segzpus, and hibzpus is gifmpus, and pixspus is hibzpus, and yutmpus is pixspus and zugppus, and vigbpus is yutmpus and giccpus, and vupvpus is vigbpus and muvbpus, and buywpus is vupvpus, and sigtpus is buywpus and yugzpus, and coqgpus is sigtpus, and molkpus is coqgpus, and yoxkpus is molkpus, and tujzpus is yoxkpus and zawcpus and ketgpus, and biydpus is tujzpus, and wuhxpus is biydpus, and dokfpus is wuhxpus and loqdpus and nomlpus, and vigfpus is bikvpus, and bikvpus is dokfpus, and huhnpus is vigfpus and tacwpus, and wokfpus is huhnpus, and ladqpus is wokfpus, and femwpus is ladqpus, and nadmpus is femwpus and safkpus, and kinrpus is nadmpus, and ruddpus is kinrpus, and wivspus is ruddpus and miccpus, and qugnpus is wivspus, and hobfpus is qugnpus and colqpus, and gohspus is hobfpus and nelxpus, and rarzpus is gohspus, and foxnpus is rarzpus and nozgpus, and govrpus is foxnpus, and vejvpus is govrpus and xoqppus, and xomcpus is vejvpus, and haxfpus is xomcpus and yeghpus, and nixqpus is haxfpus, and lupgpus is nixqpus and cayrpus, and zafypus is lupgpus, and relnpus is zafypus, and midjpus is relnpus, and jocbpus is midjpus and wulppus, and gatspus is jocbpus, so x is gatspus.\n\nThis is a long chain, but I need to see if babgpus is in this chain. babgpus is in cenmpus, and cenmpus is related to soklpus, but soklpus is not in this chain directly.\n\nFrom the chain, I have lupgpus, which is from zafypus, but soklpus is not connected to lupgpus.\n\nsoklpus is cenmpus, and xojqpus is soklpus, but xojqpus is also vijdpus, and vijdpus is refkpus, and refkpus is dubjpus, and dubjpus is qinvpus, and qinvpus is nujrpus, and nujrpus is zoqkpus, and zoqkpus is lowxpus, and lowxpus is part of kojypus, which is part of mayppus, which is part of hanspus, which is part of bilgpus, which is part of setmpus, which is part of lopdpus, which is part of gofdpus, which is part of gactpus, which is part of cebnpus, which is part of dahtpus, which is part of nohnpus, which is part of zumcpus, which is part of tixzpus, which is part of volppus, which is part of dojvpus, which is part of jozbpus, which is part of kirdpus, which is part of qokmpus, which is part of timhpus, which is part of hiwrpus, which is part of wipspus, which is part of vayzpus, which is part of gifmpus, which is part of hibzpus, which is part of pixspus, which is part of yutmpus, which is part of vigbpus, which is part of vupvpus, which is part of buywpus, which is part of sigtpus, which is part of coqgpus, which is part of molkpus, which is part of yoxkpus, which is part of tujzpus, which is part of biydpus, which is part of wuhxpus, which is part of dokfpus, which is part of bikvpus, which is part of vigfpus, which is part of huhnpus, which is part of wokfpus, which is part of ladqpus, which is part of femwpus, which is part of nadmpus, which is part of kinrpus, which is part of ruddpus, which is part of wivspus, which is part of qugnpus, which is part of hobfpus, which is part of gohspus, which is part of rarzpus, which is part of foxnpus, which is part of govrpus, which is part of vejvpus, which is part of xomcpus, which is part of haxfpus, which is part of nixqpus, which is part of lupgpus. So ultimately, from dubjpus, we can go to lupgpus, but dubjpus is also connected to qinvpus, etc., and from lupgpus, we have nixqpus, which is haxfpus, etc., but this doesn't include soklpus or cenmpus.\n\nFor soklpus, we have xojqpus is soklpus, and vijdpus is xojqpus, and vijdpus is also celkpus, but celkpus is xoxlpus, which is fihppus, which is matkpus, and that doesn't connect to the main chain.\n\nSo from gatspus, we have a long chain to lupgpus, but lupgpus doesn't connect to soklpus or cenmpus.\n\nTherefore, there is no path from gatspus to cenmpus or to babgpus.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any other connection.\n\nWe have soklpus is cenmpus, and xojqpus is soklpus, but is xojqpus connected to anything else? From the information, vijdpus is xojqpus, and vijdpus is also tadlpus? No, \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not stated. Let's see: \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not in the information. I see \"tadlpus is pedkpus and paddpus\" but that's about tadlpus, not vijdpus.\n\nFrom the list: \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not there. Instead, I have \"vijdpus is xojqpus\" and \"vijdpus is celkpus\" from \"vijdpus is celkpus\" which is given? Let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the given information: \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not stated. What is stated is: \"tadlpus is pedkpus and paddpus.\" and \"vijdpus is xojqpus\" and \"refkpus is vijdpus\" and \"dubjpus is refkpus\" and also \"vijdpus is celkpus\" from \"vijdpus is celkpus\" ? Let's find where vijdpus is mentioned.\n\nFrom the text: \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not there. The only mentions of vijdpus are:\n\n- \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not said. Instead, I see: \"tadlpus is pedkpus and paddpus.\" and then \"vijdpus is xojqpus.\" and later \"refkpus is vijdpus\" and \"dubjpus is refkpus\" and also \"vijdpus is celkpus\" from the statement \"vijdpus is celkpus\" which is given in the list? Let's look at the initial list.\n\nIn the given information, it says: \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not present. Let's read the whole thing:\n\n\"buywpus is vupvpus. hobfpus is dovvpus. relnpus is zafypus. kojypus is lowxpus and kumdpus. govrpus is pabppus and qaxmpus. gatspus is jocbpus. gactpus is gofdpus. lopdpus is setmpus. dubjpus is refkpus. qinvpus is dubjpus and risjpus. tixzpus is zumcpus and faprpus. govrpus is foxnpus. qugnpus is wivspus. mayppus is kojypus. dolnpus is qozmpus and peqppus. vupvpus is vigbpus and muvbpus. cenmpus is babgpus and yarypus and darhpus. midjpus is relnpus. xojqpus is soklpus. bilgpus is hanspus. xoxlpus is fihppus. celkpus is xoxlpus. yoxkpus is molkpus. hanspus is mayppus and bijqpus. soklpus is cenmpus. volppus is tixzpus. femwpus is ladqpus. ladqpus is wokfpus. nixqpus is haxfpus. foxnpus is rarzpus and nozgpus. nohnpus is dahtpus and tujcpus and pihvpus and deztpus. gofdpus is lopdpus. rarzpus is gohspus. dojvpus is volppus and suhlpus. vayzpus is wipspus. lupgpus is nixqpus and cayrpus. kirdpus is jozbpus and supmpus. fihppus is matkpus. zumcpus is nohnpus. vijdpus is tadlpus. yutmpus is pixspus and zugppus. dubjpus is sercpus and hilwpus. x is gatspus. timhpus is qokmpus and hohbpus and regypus. wivspus is ruddpus and miccpus. sigtpus is buywpus and yugzpus. ruddpus is kinrpus. vigbpus is yutmpus and giccpus. tadlpus is pedkpus and paddpus. lowxpus is zoqkpus. hobfpus is qugnpus and colqpus. dokfpus is wuhxpus and loqdpus and nomlpus. molkpus is coqgpus. hibzpus is gifmpus. pabppus is rapfpus and nipqpus. biydpus is tujzpus. hiwrpus is timhpus. dahtpus is cebnpus and misrpus. pixspus is hibzpus. vigfpus is bikvpus. vijdpus is xojqpus. refkpus is vijdpus. coqgpus is sigtpus. nujrpus is qinvpus. bikvpus is dokfpus. lowxpus is dolnpus. zafypus is lupgpus. setmpus is bilgpus and qejrpus and lofbpus. jocbpus is midjpus and wulppus. xomcpus is vejvpus. gohspus is hobfpus and nelxpus. nadmpus is femwpus and safkpus. tujzpus is yoxkpus and zawcpus and ketgpus. kinrpus is nadmpus. wipspus is hiwrpus and jokypus. wokfpus is huhnpus. dovvpus is kurbpus. vejvpus is govrpus and xoqppus. jozbpus is dojvpus and keflpus. wuhxpus is biydpus. zoqkpus is nujrpus and howkpus. haxfpus is xomcpus and yeghpus. gifmpus is vayzpus and markpus and segzpus. huhnpus is vigfpus and tacwpus. qokmpus is kirdpus and sirhpus. cebnpus is gactpus. vijdpus is celkpus. \"\n\nAh, here it is: \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not stated, but instead, we have \"vijdpus is xojqpus\" and later \"vijdpus is celkpus\" at the end. Also, \"tadlpus is pedkpus and paddpus\" is separate.\n\nSo from \"vijdpus is xojqpus\" and \"xojqpus is soklpus\" and \"soklpus is cenmpus\", so vijdpus is soklpus and thus cenmpus.\n\nBut vijdpus is also celkpus, but that doesn't help.\n\nNow, is vijdpus connected to gatspus? From gatspus, we have jocbpus, which is midjpus and wulppus, midjpus is relnpus, relnpus is zafypus, zafypus is lupgpus, etc., but no direct connection to vijdpus.\n\nHowever, from dubjpus, we have dubjpus is refkpus, and refkpus is vijdpus, so dubjpus is vijdpus.\n\nBut is dubjpus connected to gatspus? gatspus is jocbpus, which is midjpus, etc., and from the long chain, we have setmpus is bilgpus, etc., but dubjpus is not in that chain.\n\ndubjpus is mentioned: \"dubjpus is refkpus\" and \"qinvpus is dubjpus and risjpus\" and \"nujrpus is qinvpus\" and \"zoqkpus is nujrpus and howkpus\" and \"lowxpus is zoqkpus\" and \"lowxpus is dolnpus\" but also \"kojypus is lowxpus and kumdpus\" and \"mayppus is kojypus\" and \"hanspus is mayppus and bijqpus\" and \"bilgpus is hanspus\" and \"setmpus is bilgpus and qejrpus and lofbpus\" and \"lopdpus is setmpus\" and \"gofdpus is lopdpus\" and \"gactpus is gofdpus\" and \"cebnpus is gactpus\" and \"dahtpus is cebnpus and misrpus\" and so on, so eventually, from dubjpus, we can go to lowxpus, which is part of the chain that connects to lupgpus, but that doesn't connect to gatspus.\n\ngatspus is jocbpus, which is midjpus, which is relnpus, which is zafypus, which is lupgpus. So gatspus is connected to lupgpus.\n\nBut from dubjpus, through qinvpus, nujrpus, zoqkpus, lowxpus, and lowxpus is also part of kojypus, but kojypus is not directly connected to lupgpus. lupgpus is from zafypus, which is from relnpus, which is from midjpus, which is from jocbpus, which is from gatspus.\n\nSo the chain from dubjpus goes to lowxpus, but lowxpus is not the same as lupgpus. lowxpus is a category that contains zoqkpus, but zoqkpus contains nujrpus, which contains qinvpus, which contains dubjpus.\n\nBut lowxpus is also mentioned as part of kojypus: \"kojypus is lowxpus and kumdpus\" and \"mayppus is kojypus\" etc., but this chain doesn't connect to zafypus or lupgpus.\n\nlupgpus is from zafypus, which is from relnpus, which is from midjpus, which is from jocbpus, which is from gatspus.\n\nSo there is no overlap between the chain from gatspus to lupgpus and the chain from dubjpus to lowxpus.\n\nTherefore, vijdpus is not connected to gatspus.\n\nSince vijdpus is cenmpus (through xojqpus and soklpus), and gatspus is not connected to vijdpus, then gatspus is not connected to cenmpus, and thus not to babgpus.\n\nSo, x is gatspus, and gatspus is not babgpus.\n\nTherefore, it is false that x is babgpus.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't any other path.\n\nWe have cenmpus is babgpus, and soklpus is cenmpus, and xojqpus is soklpus, and vijdpus is xojqpus, and refkpus is vijdpus, and dubjpus is refkpus, and qinvpus is dubjpus, and nujrpus is qinvpus, and zoqkpus is nujrpus, and lowxpus is zoqkpus, and lowxpus is dolnpus, but dolnpus is qozmpus and peqppus, which doesn't help.\n\nAlso, lowxpus is part of kojypus, but kojypus is mayppus, which is hanspus, which is bilgpus, which is setmpus, which is lopdpus, which is gofdpus, which is gactpus, which is cebnpus, which is dahtpus, which is nohnpus, which is zumcpus, which is tixzpus, which is volppus, which is dojvpus, which is jozbpus, which is kirdpus, which is qokmpus, which is timhpus, which is hiwrpus, which is wipspus, which is vayzpus, which is gifmpus, which is hibzpus, which is pixspus, which is yutmpus, which is vigbpus, which is vupvpus, which is buywpus, which is sigtpus, which is coqgpus, which is molkpus, which is yoxkpus, which is tujzpus, which is biydpus, which is wuhxpus, which is dokfpus, which is bikvpus, which is vigfpus, which is huhnpus, which is wokfpus, which is ladqpus, which is femwpus, which is nadmpus, which is kinrpus, which is ruddpus, which is wivspus, which is qugnpus, which is hobfpus, which is gohspus, which is rarzpus, which is foxnpus, which is govrpus, which is vejvpus, which is xomcpus, which is haxfpus, which is nixqpus, which is lupgpus. So from lowxpus, through this long chain, we eventually get to lupgpus.\n\nBut lupgpus is already connected to gatspus through zafypus and relnpus and midjpus and jocbpus.\n\nSo, since lowxpus is connected to lupgpus, and dubjpus is connected to lowxpus, then dubjpus is connected to lupgpus.\n\nBut gatspus is also connected to lupgpus, so indirectly, dubjpus is connected to gatspus? No, because gatspus is a category, and dubjpus is a category, but they are connected through the chain, but since \"is\" means belongs to, we need to see if gatspus is contained in babgpus or vice versa.\n\nWe want to know if x (gatspus) is babgpus. babgpus is a subcategory of cenmpus.\n\nFrom gatspus, we have gatspus is jocbpus, which is midjpus, which is relnpus, which is zafypus, which is lupgpus.\n\nFrom lupgpus, we have nixqpus and cayrpus, and nixqpus is haxfpus, which is xomcpus and yeghpus, and xomcpus is vejvpus, which is govrpus and xoqppus, and govrpus is foxnpus, etc., and eventually through the long chain, we get back to lowxpus, but lowxpus is a category that contains zoqkpus, which contains nujrpus, which contains qinvpus, which contains dubjpus, but dubjpus is not gatspus.\n\ngatspus is a specific entity, and we are tracing what categories it belongs to.\n\nx is gatspus, so we are asking if gatspus belongs to babgpus.\n\nFrom the chain, gatspus belongs to jocbpus, which belongs to midjpus, which belongs to relnpus, which belongs to zafypus, which belongs to lupgpus.\n\nlupgpus belongs to nixqpus? No, lupgpus is nixqpus and cayrpus, meaning lupgpus contains nixqpus and cayrpus, so nixqpus is a subcategory of lupgpus.\n\nSimilarly, from the other chain, lowxpus is a subcategory of kojypus, etc., but lowxpus contains zoqkpus, etc.\n\nBut for gatspus to be babgpus, there must be a path from gatspus to babgpus.\n\nSince babgpus is in cenmpus, and cenmpus is soklpus, and soklpus is xojqpus, and xojqpus is vijdpus, and vijdpus is refkpus, and refkpus is dubjpus, and dubjpus is qinvpus, etc., and from dubjpus, we have a path to lowxpus, and from lowxpus, we have a path to lupgpus, but lupgpus is already above gatspus.\n\nSo, from gatspus, we go up to lupgpus, and from lupgpus, we go down to nixqpus, haxfpus, xomcpus, vejvpus, govrpus, foxnpus, rarzpus, gohspus, hobfpus, qugnpus, wivspus, ruddpus, kinrpus, nadmpus, femwpus, ladqpus, wokfpus, huhnpus, vigfpus, bikvpus, dokfpus, wuhxpus, biydpus, tujzpus, yoxkpus, molkpus, coqgpus, sigtpus, buywpus, vupvpus, vigbpus, yutmpus, pixspus, hibzpus, gifmpus, vayzpus, wipspus, hiwrpus, timhpus, qokmpus, kirdpus, jozbpus, dojvpus, volppus, tixzpus, zumcpus, nohnpus, dahtpus, cebnpus, gactpus, gofdpus, lopdpus, setmpus, bilgpus, hanspus, mayppus, kojypus, lowxpus.\n\nSo from lupgpus, we eventually reach lowxpus through this long loop.\n\nBut lowxpus contains zoqkpus, which contains nujrpus, which contains qinvpus, which contains dubjpus.\n\nBut dubjpus is not gatspus. gatspus is a different branch.\n\nSo, although there is a connection from lupgpus to lowxpus, gatspus is under lupgpus, but lowxpus is also under lupgpus indirectly, but gatspus and lowxpus are both subcategories of lupgpus, but they are not the same category.\n\nTherefore, gatspus does not belong to lowxpus or to dubjpus or to vijdpus or to cenmpus.\n\nThus, gatspus is not babgpus.\n\nSo, for x is babgpus, it is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be false.",
  "thinking_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus. From the given information, x is defined as gatspus. So, x = gatspus.\n\nNow, I need to see if gatspus is connected to babgpus in any way. Looking at the information, I see that babgpus is mentioned in the context of cenmpus: \"cenmpus is babgpus and yarypus and darhpus.\" So cenmpus contains babgpus.\n\nBut I need to get from gatspus to cenmpus or directly to babgpus.\n\nI know that gatspus is jocbpus: \"gatspus is jocbpus.\"\n\nAnd jocbpus is midjpus and wulppus: \"jocbpus is midjpus and wulppus.\"\n\nmidjpus is relnpus: \"midjpus is relnpus.\"\n\nrelnpus is zafypus: \"relnpus is zafypus.\"\n\nzafypus is lupgpus: \"zafypus is lupgpus.\"\n\nlupgpus is nixqpus and cayrpus: \"lupgpus is nixqpus and cayrpus.\"\n\nnixqpus is haxfpus: \"nixqpus is haxfpus.\"\n\nhaxfpus is xomcpus and yeghpus: \"haxfpus is xomcpus and yeghpus.\"\n\nxomcpus is vejvpus: \"xomcpus is vejvpus.\"\n\nvejvpus is govrpus and xoqppus: \"vejvpus is govrpus and xoqppus.\"\n\ngovrpus is pabppus and qaxmpus: \"govrpus is pabppus and qaxmpus.\" Also, \"govrpus is foxnpus.\" But that might be redundant or multiple categories.\n\nI need to find a path to cenmpus since cenmpus has babgpus.\n\nI also see that soklpus is cenmpus: \"soklpus is cenmpus.\"\n\nAnd xojqpus is soklpus: \"xojqpus is soklpus.\"\n\nBut from earlier, I have vijdpus is xojqpus: \"vijdpus is xojqpus.\"\n\nAnd refkpus is vijdpus: \"refkpus is vijdpus.\"\n\nAnd dubjpus is refkpus: \"dubjpus is refkpus.\"\n\nBut I need to get to gatspus, which is jocbpus, and jocbpus is midjpus, which is relnpus, which is zafypus, which is lupgpus, etc. This seems long and might not connect directly to cenmpus.\n\nI recall that from dubjpus, there might be another path. But let's see if there's a shorter way.\n\nI have x = gatspus = jocbpus = midjpus = relnpus = zafypus = lupgpus\n\nlupgpus is nixqpus and cayrpus. nixqpus is haxfpus, which is xomcpus and yeghpus. xomcpus is vejvpus, which is govrpus and xoqppus. govrpus is pabppus and qaxmpus, and also foxnpus. foxnpus is rarzpus and nozgpus. rarzpus is gohspus. gohspus is hobfpus and nelxpus. hobfpus is dovvpus, and also hobfpus is qugnpus and colqpus. dovvpus is kurbpus. This doesn't seem to lead to cenmpus.\n\nPerhaps from lupgpus, cayrpus might lead somewhere, but cayrpus isn't defined further.\n\nI need to consider another approach. I have soklpus is cenmpus, and xojqpus is soklpus, and vijdpus is xojqpus, but how do I connect to gatspus?\n\nFrom jocbpus, which is gatspus, jocbpus is also wulppus, but wulppus isn't defined, so I might only have midjpus to work with.\n\nmidjpus is relnpus, which is zafypus, which is lupgpus. But lupgpus doesn't directly connect to soklpus or cenmpus.\n\nI see that celkpus is xoxlpus, and xoxlpus is fihppus, but that might not help.\n\nAnother thing: vigbpus is yutmpus and giccpus, but vigbpus is part of vupvpus, which is buywpus, but buywpus is vupvpus, and sigtpus is buywpus and yugzpus, but that seems unrelated.\n\nI need to find if there's a chain from gatspus to babgpus.\n\nLet's list all the relationships that involve babgpus. babgpus is only mentioned in cenmpus: \"cenmpus is babgpus and yarypus and darhpus.\"\n\nAnd soklpus is cenmpus: \"soklpus is cenmpus.\"\n\nAnd xojqpus is soklpus: \"xojqpus is soklpus.\"\n\nNow, who is xojqpus? From the information, vijdpus is xojqpus: \"vijdpus is xojqpus.\"\n\nAlso, vijdpus is celkpus: \"vijdpus is celkpus.\" But that might be multiple things, or perhaps vijdpus has multiple categories.\n\nThe note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so A can be in multiple categories.\n\nSo vijdpus is xojqpus and also celkpus.\n\nBut celkpus is xoxlpus: \"celkpus is xoxlpus.\"\n\nxoxlpus is fihppus: \"xoxlpus is fihppus.\"\n\nfihppus is matkpus: \"fihppus is matkpus.\" But matkpus isn't defined further, so this might not help.\n\nFrom vijdpus, we also have refkpus is vijdpus: \"refkpus is vijdpus.\"\n\nAnd dubjpus is refkpus: \"dubjpus is refkpus.\"\n\nAnd qinvpus is dubjpus and risjpus: \"qinvpus is dubjpus and risjpus.\"\n\nAnd zoqkpus is nujrpus and howkpus: \"zoqkpus is nujrpus and howkpus.\" But nujrpus is qinvpus: \"nujrpus is qinvpus.\"\n\nAlso, lowxpus is zoqkpus: \"lowxpus is zoqkpus.\"\n\nAnd lowxpus is dolnpus: \"lowxpus is dolnpus.\" But also, kojypus is lowxpus and kumdpus, and mayppus is kojypus, and hanspus is mayppus and bijqpus, and bilgpus is hanspus, and setmpus is bilgpus and qejrpus and lofbpus, and lopdpus is setmpus, and gofdpus is lopdpus, and gactpus is gofdpus, and cebnpus is gactpus, and dahtpus is cebnpus and misrpus, and nohnpus is dahtpus and tujcpus and pihvpus and deztpus, and zumcpus is nohnpus, and tixzpus is zumcpus and faprpus, and volppus is tixzpus, and dojvpus is volppus and suhlpus, and jozbpus is dojvpus and keflpus, and kirdpus is jozbpus and supmpus, and qokmpus is kirdpus and sirhpus, and timhpus is qokmpus and hohbpus and regypus, and hiwrpus is timhpus, and wipspus is hiwrpus and jokypus, and vayzpus is wipspus, and gifmpus is vayzpus and markpus and segzpus, and hibzpus is gifmpus, and pixspus is hibzpus, and yutmpus is pixspus and zugppus, and vigbpus is yutmpus and giccpus, and vupvpus is vigbpus and muvbpus, and buywpus is vupvpus, and sigtpus is buywpus and yugzpus, and coqgpus is sigtpus, and molkpus is coqgpus, and yoxkpus is molkpus, and tujzpus is yoxkpus and zawcpus and ketgpus, and biydpus is tujzpus, and wuhxpus is biydpus, and dokfpus is wuhxpus and loqdpus and nomlpus, and vigfpus is bikvpus, and bikvpus is dokfpus, and huhnpus is vigfpus and tacwpus, and wokfpus is huhnpus, and ladqpus is wokfpus, and femwpus is ladqpus, and nadmpus is femwpus and safkpus, and kinrpus is nadmpus, and ruddpus is kinrpus, and wivspus is ruddpus and miccpus, and qugnpus is wivspus, and hobfpus is qugnpus and colqpus, and gohspus is hobfpus and nelxpus, and rarzpus is gohspus, and foxnpus is rarzpus and nozgpus, and govrpus is foxnpus, and vejvpus is govrpus and xoqppus, and xomcpus is vejvpus, and haxfpus is xomcpus and yeghpus, and nixqpus is haxfpus, and lupgpus is nixqpus and cayrpus, and zafypus is lupgpus, and relnpus is zafypus, and midjpus is relnpus, and jocbpus is midjpus and wulppus, and gatspus is jocbpus, so x is gatspus.\n\nThis is a long chain, but I need to see if babgpus is in this chain. babgpus is in cenmpus, and cenmpus is related to soklpus, but soklpus is not in this chain directly.\n\nFrom the chain, I have lupgpus, which is from zafypus, but soklpus is not connected to lupgpus.\n\nsoklpus is cenmpus, and xojqpus is soklpus, but xojqpus is also vijdpus, and vijdpus is refkpus, and refkpus is dubjpus, and dubjpus is qinvpus, and qinvpus is nujrpus, and nujrpus is zoqkpus, and zoqkpus is lowxpus, and lowxpus is part of kojypus, which is part of mayppus, which is part of hanspus, which is part of bilgpus, which is part of setmpus, which is part of lopdpus, which is part of gofdpus, which is part of gactpus, which is part of cebnpus, which is part of dahtpus, which is part of nohnpus, which is part of zumcpus, which is part of tixzpus, which is part of volppus, which is part of dojvpus, which is part of jozbpus, which is part of kirdpus, which is part of qokmpus, which is part of timhpus, which is part of hiwrpus, which is part of wipspus, which is part of vayzpus, which is part of gifmpus, which is part of hibzpus, which is part of pixspus, which is part of yutmpus, which is part of vigbpus, which is part of vupvpus, which is part of buywpus, which is part of sigtpus, which is part of coqgpus, which is part of molkpus, which is part of yoxkpus, which is part of tujzpus, which is part of biydpus, which is part of wuhxpus, which is part of dokfpus, which is part of bikvpus, which is part of vigfpus, which is part of huhnpus, which is part of wokfpus, which is part of ladqpus, which is part of femwpus, which is part of nadmpus, which is part of kinrpus, which is part of ruddpus, which is part of wivspus, which is part of qugnpus, which is part of hobfpus, which is part of gohspus, which is part of rarzpus, which is part of foxnpus, which is part of govrpus, which is part of vejvpus, which is part of xomcpus, which is part of haxfpus, which is part of nixqpus, which is part of lupgpus. So ultimately, from dubjpus, we can go to lupgpus, but dubjpus is also connected to qinvpus, etc., and from lupgpus, we have nixqpus, which is haxfpus, etc., but this doesn't include soklpus or cenmpus.\n\nFor soklpus, we have xojqpus is soklpus, and vijdpus is xojqpus, and vijdpus is also celkpus, but celkpus is xoxlpus, which is fihppus, which is matkpus, and that doesn't connect to the main chain.\n\nSo from gatspus, we have a long chain to lupgpus, but lupgpus doesn't connect to soklpus or cenmpus.\n\nTherefore, there is no path from gatspus to cenmpus or to babgpus.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any other connection.\n\nWe have soklpus is cenmpus, and xojqpus is soklpus, but is xojqpus connected to anything else? From the information, vijdpus is xojqpus, and vijdpus is also tadlpus? No, \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not stated. Let's see: \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not in the information. I see \"tadlpus is pedkpus and paddpus\" but that's about tadlpus, not vijdpus.\n\nFrom the list: \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not there. Instead, I have \"vijdpus is xojqpus\" and \"vijdpus is celkpus\" from \"vijdpus is celkpus\" which is given? Let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the given information: \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not stated. What is stated is: \"tadlpus is pedkpus and paddpus.\" and \"vijdpus is xojqpus\" and \"refkpus is vijdpus\" and \"dubjpus is refkpus\" and also \"vijdpus is celkpus\" from \"vijdpus is celkpus\" ? Let's find where vijdpus is mentioned.\n\nFrom the text: \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not there. The only mentions of vijdpus are:\n\n- \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not said. Instead, I see: \"tadlpus is pedkpus and paddpus.\" and then \"vijdpus is xojqpus.\" and later \"refkpus is vijdpus\" and \"dubjpus is refkpus\" and also \"vijdpus is celkpus\" from the statement \"vijdpus is celkpus\" which is given in the list? Let's look at the initial list.\n\nIn the given information, it says: \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not present. Let's read the whole thing:\n\n\"buywpus is vupvpus. hobfpus is dovvpus. relnpus is zafypus. kojypus is lowxpus and kumdpus. govrpus is pabppus and qaxmpus. gatspus is jocbpus. gactpus is gofdpus. lopdpus is setmpus. dubjpus is refkpus. qinvpus is dubjpus and risjpus. tixzpus is zumcpus and faprpus. govrpus is foxnpus. qugnpus is wivspus. mayppus is kojypus. dolnpus is qozmpus and peqppus. vupvpus is vigbpus and muvbpus. cenmpus is babgpus and yarypus and darhpus. midjpus is relnpus. xojqpus is soklpus. bilgpus is hanspus. xoxlpus is fihppus. celkpus is xoxlpus. yoxkpus is molkpus. hanspus is mayppus and bijqpus. soklpus is cenmpus. volppus is tixzpus. femwpus is ladqpus. ladqpus is wokfpus. nixqpus is haxfpus. foxnpus is rarzpus and nozgpus. nohnpus is dahtpus and tujcpus and pihvpus and deztpus. gofdpus is lopdpus. rarzpus is gohspus. dojvpus is volppus and suhlpus. vayzpus is wipspus. lupgpus is nixqpus and cayrpus. kirdpus is jozbpus and supmpus. fihppus is matkpus. zumcpus is nohnpus. vijdpus is tadlpus. yutmpus is pixspus and zugppus. dubjpus is sercpus and hilwpus. x is gatspus. timhpus is qokmpus and hohbpus and regypus. wivspus is ruddpus and miccpus. sigtpus is buywpus and yugzpus. ruddpus is kinrpus. vigbpus is yutmpus and giccpus. tadlpus is pedkpus and paddpus. lowxpus is zoqkpus. hobfpus is qugnpus and colqpus. dokfpus is wuhxpus and loqdpus and nomlpus. molkpus is coqgpus. hibzpus is gifmpus. pabppus is rapfpus and nipqpus. biydpus is tujzpus. hiwrpus is timhpus. dahtpus is cebnpus and misrpus. pixspus is hibzpus. vigfpus is bikvpus. vijdpus is xojqpus. refkpus is vijdpus. coqgpus is sigtpus. nujrpus is qinvpus. bikvpus is dokfpus. lowxpus is dolnpus. zafypus is lupgpus. setmpus is bilgpus and qejrpus and lofbpus. jocbpus is midjpus and wulppus. xomcpus is vejvpus. gohspus is hobfpus and nelxpus. nadmpus is femwpus and safkpus. tujzpus is yoxkpus and zawcpus and ketgpus. kinrpus is nadmpus. wipspus is hiwrpus and jokypus. wokfpus is huhnpus. dovvpus is kurbpus. vejvpus is govrpus and xoqppus. jozbpus is dojvpus and keflpus. wuhxpus is biydpus. zoqkpus is nujrpus and howkpus. haxfpus is xomcpus and yeghpus. gifmpus is vayzpus and markpus and segzpus. huhnpus is vigfpus and tacwpus. qokmpus is kirdpus and sirhpus. cebnpus is gactpus. vijdpus is celkpus. \"\n\nAh, here it is: \"vijdpus is tadlpus\" is not stated, but instead, we have \"vijdpus is xojqpus\" and later \"vijdpus is celkpus\" at the end. Also, \"tadlpus is pedkpus and paddpus\" is separate.\n\nSo from \"vijdpus is xojqpus\" and \"xojqpus is soklpus\" and \"soklpus is cenmpus\", so vijdpus is soklpus and thus cenmpus.\n\nBut vijdpus is also celkpus, but that doesn't help.\n\nNow, is vijdpus connected to gatspus? From gatspus, we have jocbpus, which is midjpus and wulppus, midjpus is relnpus, relnpus is zafypus, zafypus is lupgpus, etc., but no direct connection to vijdpus.\n\nHowever, from dubjpus, we have dubjpus is refkpus, and refkpus is vijdpus, so dubjpus is vijdpus.\n\nBut is dubjpus connected to gatspus? gatspus is jocbpus, which is midjpus, etc., and from the long chain, we have setmpus is bilgpus, etc., but dubjpus is not in that chain.\n\ndubjpus is mentioned: \"dubjpus is refkpus\" and \"qinvpus is dubjpus and risjpus\" and \"nujrpus is qinvpus\" and \"zoqkpus is nujrpus and howkpus\" and \"lowxpus is zoqkpus\" and \"lowxpus is dolnpus\" but also \"kojypus is lowxpus and kumdpus\" and \"mayppus is kojypus\" and \"hanspus is mayppus and bijqpus\" and \"bilgpus is hanspus\" and \"setmpus is bilgpus and qejrpus and lofbpus\" and \"lopdpus is setmpus\" and \"gofdpus is lopdpus\" and \"gactpus is gofdpus\" and \"cebnpus is gactpus\" and \"dahtpus is cebnpus and misrpus\" and so on, so eventually, from dubjpus, we can go to lowxpus, which is part of the chain that connects to lupgpus, but that doesn't connect to gatspus.\n\ngatspus is jocbpus, which is midjpus, which is relnpus, which is zafypus, which is lupgpus. So gatspus is connected to lupgpus.\n\nBut from dubjpus, through qinvpus, nujrpus, zoqkpus, lowxpus, and lowxpus is also part of kojypus, but kojypus is not directly connected to lupgpus. lupgpus is from zafypus, which is from relnpus, which is from midjpus, which is from jocbpus, which is from gatspus.\n\nSo the chain from dubjpus goes to lowxpus, but lowxpus is not the same as lupgpus. lowxpus is a category that contains zoqkpus, but zoqkpus contains nujrpus, which contains qinvpus, which contains dubjpus.\n\nBut lowxpus is also mentioned as part of kojypus: \"kojypus is lowxpus and kumdpus\" and \"mayppus is kojypus\" etc., but this chain doesn't connect to zafypus or lupgpus.\n\nlupgpus is from zafypus, which is from relnpus, which is from midjpus, which is from jocbpus, which is from gatspus.\n\nSo there is no overlap between the chain from gatspus to lupgpus and the chain from dubjpus to lowxpus.\n\nTherefore, vijdpus is not connected to gatspus.\n\nSince vijdpus is cenmpus (through xojqpus and soklpus), and gatspus is not connected to vijdpus, then gatspus is not connected to cenmpus, and thus not to babgpus.\n\nSo, x is gatspus, and gatspus is not babgpus.\n\nTherefore, it is false that x is babgpus.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't any other path.\n\nWe have cenmpus is babgpus, and soklpus is cenmpus, and xojqpus is soklpus, and vijdpus is xojqpus, and refkpus is vijdpus, and dubjpus is refkpus, and qinvpus is dubjpus, and nujrpus is qinvpus, and zoqkpus is nujrpus, and lowxpus is zoqkpus, and lowxpus is dolnpus, but dolnpus is qozmpus and peqppus, which doesn't help.\n\nAlso, lowxpus is part of kojypus, but kojypus is mayppus, which is hanspus, which is bilgpus, which is setmpus, which is lopdpus, which is gofdpus, which is gactpus, which is cebnpus, which is dahtpus, which is nohnpus, which is zumcpus, which is tixzpus, which is volppus, which is dojvpus, which is jozbpus, which is kirdpus, which is qokmpus, which is timhpus, which is hiwrpus, which is wipspus, which is vayzpus, which is gifmpus, which is hibzpus, which is pixspus, which is yutmpus, which is vigbpus, which is vupvpus, which is buywpus, which is sigtpus, which is coqgpus, which is molkpus, which is yoxkpus, which is tujzpus, which is biydpus, which is wuhxpus, which is dokfpus, which is bikvpus, which is vigfpus, which is huhnpus, which is wokfpus, which is ladqpus, which is femwpus, which is nadmpus, which is kinrpus, which is ruddpus, which is wivspus, which is qugnpus, which is hobfpus, which is gohspus, which is rarzpus, which is foxnpus, which is govrpus, which is vejvpus, which is xomcpus, which is haxfpus, which is nixqpus, which is lupgpus. So from lowxpus, through this long chain, we eventually get to lupgpus.\n\nBut lupgpus is already connected to gatspus through zafypus and relnpus and midjpus and jocbpus.\n\nSo, since lowxpus is connected to lupgpus, and dubjpus is connected to lowxpus, then dubjpus is connected to lupgpus.\n\nBut gatspus is also connected to lupgpus, so indirectly, dubjpus is connected to gatspus? No, because gatspus is a category, and dubjpus is a category, but they are connected through the chain, but since \"is\" means belongs to, we need to see if gatspus is contained in babgpus or vice versa.\n\nWe want to know if x (gatspus) is babgpus. babgpus is a subcategory of cenmpus.\n\nFrom gatspus, we have gatspus is jocbpus, which is midjpus, which is relnpus, which is zafypus, which is lupgpus.\n\nFrom lupgpus, we have nixqpus and cayrpus, and nixqpus is haxfpus, which is xomcpus and yeghpus, and xomcpus is vejvpus, which is govrpus and xoqppus, and govrpus is foxnpus, etc., and eventually through the long chain, we get back to lowxpus, but lowxpus is a category that contains zoqkpus, which contains nujrpus, which contains qinvpus, which contains dubjpus, but dubjpus is not gatspus.\n\ngatspus is a specific entity, and we are tracing what categories it belongs to.\n\nx is gatspus, so we are asking if gatspus belongs to babgpus.\n\nFrom the chain, gatspus belongs to jocbpus, which belongs to midjpus, which belongs to relnpus, which belongs to zafypus, which belongs to lupgpus.\n\nlupgpus belongs to nixqpus? No, lupgpus is nixqpus and cayrpus, meaning lupgpus contains nixqpus and cayrpus, so nixqpus is a subcategory of lupgpus.\n\nSimilarly, from the other chain, lowxpus is a subcategory of kojypus, etc., but lowxpus contains zoqkpus, etc.\n\nBut for gatspus to be babgpus, there must be a path from gatspus to babgpus.\n\nSince babgpus is in cenmpus, and cenmpus is soklpus, and soklpus is xojqpus, and xojqpus is vijdpus, and vijdpus is refkpus, and refkpus is dubjpus, and dubjpus is qinvpus, etc., and from dubjpus, we have a path to lowxpus, and from lowxpus, we have a path to lupgpus, but lupgpus is already above gatspus.\n\nSo, from gatspus, we go up to lupgpus, and from lupgpus, we go down to nixqpus, haxfpus, xomcpus, vejvpus, govrpus, foxnpus, rarzpus, gohspus, hobfpus, qugnpus, wivspus, ruddpus, kinrpus, nadmpus, femwpus, ladqpus, wokfpus, huhnpus, vigfpus, bikvpus, dokfpus, wuhxpus, biydpus, tujzpus, yoxkpus, molkpus, coqgpus, sigtpus, buywpus, vupvpus, vigbpus, yutmpus, pixspus, hibzpus, gifmpus, vayzpus, wipspus, hiwrpus, timhpus, qokmpus, kirdpus, jozbpus, dojvpus, volppus, tixzpus, zumcpus, nohnpus, dahtpus, cebnpus, gactpus, gofdpus, lopdpus, setmpus, bilgpus, hanspus, mayppus, kojypus, lowxpus.\n\nSo from lupgpus, we eventually reach lowxpus through this long loop.\n\nBut lowxpus contains zoqkpus, which contains nujrpus, which contains qinvpus, which contains dubjpus.\n\nBut dubjpus is not gatspus. gatspus is a different branch.\n\nSo, although there is a connection from lupgpus to lowxpus, gatspus is under lupgpus, but lowxpus is also under lupgpus indirectly, but gatspus and lowxpus are both subcategories of lupgpus, but they are not the same category.\n\nTherefore, gatspus does not belong to lowxpus or to dubjpus or to vijdpus or to cenmpus.\n\nThus, gatspus is not babgpus.\n\nSo, for x is babgpus, it is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be false.",

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nAlso, lowxpus is part of kojypus, but kojypus is mayppus, which is hanspus, which is bilgpus, which is setmpus, which is lopdpus, which is gofdpus, which is gactpus, which is cebnpus, which is dahtpus, which is nohnpus, which is zumcpus, which is tixzpus, which is volppus, which is dojvpus, which is jozbpus, which is kirdpus, which is qokmpus, which is timhpus, which is hiwrpus, which is wipspus, which is vayzpus, which is gifmpus, which is hibzpus, which is pixspus, which is yutmpus, which is vigbpus, which is vupvpus, which is buywpus, which is sigtpus, which is coqgpus, which is molkpus, which is yoxkpus, which is tujzpus, which is biydpus, which is wuhxpus, which is dokfpus, which is bikvpus, which is vigfpus, which is huhnpus, which is wokfpus, which is ladqpus, which is femwpus, which is nadmpus, which is kinrpus, which is ruddpus, which is wivspus, which is qugnpus, which is hobfpus, which is gohspus, which is rarzpus, which is foxnpus, which is govrpus, which is vejvpus, which is xomcpus, which is haxfpus, which is nixqpus, which is lupgpus.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

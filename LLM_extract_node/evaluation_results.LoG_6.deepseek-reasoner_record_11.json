I should trace the categories that x belongs to and see if it connects to babgpus, babrpus, and babspus.\n\nFrom the given information:\n\n- x is vokkpus.\n\n- x is mirmpus and xudmpus.\n\n- x is ciwnpus.\n\nAlso, vokkpus is wiqtpus and lalhpus.\n\nwiqtpus is wipkpus.\n\nwipkpus is yaxvpus and xakvpus.\n\nyaxvpus is quczpus.\n\nquczpus is degvpus.\n\ndegvpus is nukfpus.

Wait, no, let's read carefully.\n\nThe information says: \"degvpus is nukfpus.\" and then later \"degvpus is babspus.\"? Actually, I don't see \"degvpus is babspus\" directly.

Let's see the given text: \"degvpus is nukfpus.\" and then later \"degvpus is babspus.\"? In the text, it says: \"yaxvpus is quczpus. degvpus is nukfpus. x is vokkpus. ...\" and then later \"degvpus is babspus.\"? Actually, no, in the text provided: \"**Given Information**: yaxvpus is quczpus. degvpus is nukfpus. x is vokkpus. biykpus is mexzpus and dikbpus. x is mirmpus and xudmpus. wipkpus is yaxvpus and xakvpus. macbpus is fekkpus. x is ciwnpus. tidlpus is silxpus. gexjpus is viztpus and wermpus. vokkpus is wiqtpus and lalhpus. mudrpus is macbpus. wiqtpus is wipkpus. mexzpus is mudrpus and wuwxpus and cumnpus. sawgpus is babgpus and damspus. silxpus is biykpus and wosgpus and fojbpus. mirmpus is hiktpus. hiktpus is pacbpus and hehvpus. degvpus is babspus. qukcpus is babrpus and xotzpus. quczpus is degvpus. ciwnpus is tidlpus and pirbpus. viztpus is qukcpus. pacbpus is gexjpus. jaqspus is sawgpus and mefspus. fekkpus is jaqspus and mefjpus.\"\n\nSo, yes, there is \"degvpus is babspus.\" So degvpus belongs to babspus.\n\nNow, I need to see if x is connected to babgpus, babrpus, and babspus.\n\nFirst, let's handle babspus. Since degvpus is babspus, and if x is related to degvpus, then x might be babspus.\n\nx is vokkpus, and vokkpus is wiqtpus, and wiqtpus is wipkpus, and wipkpus is yaxvpus, and yaxvpus is quczpus, and quczpus is degvpus. So, yes, x is ultimately degvpus? But remember, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so it's a chain of membership.\n\nSo, x is vokkpus, vokkpus is wiqtpus, so x is wiqtpus? Not exactly, but since vokkpus is a category that contains wiqtpus, and x is in vokkpus, so x is also in wiqtpus? I need to think in terms of set membership.\n\nIn this context, \"A is B\" means A is a subset of B or A is contained in B. So if A is B, then every instance of A is also an instance of B.\n\nSo, from x is vokkpus, and vokkpus is wiqtpus, so x is wiqtpus? But vokkpus is wiqtpus means that vokkpus is a subset of wiqtpus, so since x is in vokkpus, x is in wiqtpus.\n\nSimilarly, wiqtpus is wipkpus, so x is in wipkpus.\n\nwipkpus is yaxvpus and xakvpus, so x is in yaxvpus (since wipkpus is subset of yaxvpus).\n\nyaxvpus is quczpus, so x is in quczpus.\n\nquczpus is degvpus, so x is in degvpus.\n\nAnd degvpus is babspus, so x is in babspus.\n\nTherefore, x is babspus.\n\nSo, for babspus, it is true that x is babspus.\n\nNow, I need babgpus and babrpus.\n\nbabgpus is mentioned in sawgpus: sawgpus is babgpus and damspus. So sawgpus contains babgpus, meaning that babgpus is a subcategory of sawgpus? No: \"sawgpus is babgpus and damspus\" means that sawgpus belongs to babgpus and damspus? That doesn't make sense. Let's read carefully.\n\nThe statement is: \"sawgpus is babgpus and damspus.\" According to the note, 'A is B' means A belongs to category B, so sawgpus is contained in babgpus? Or is it that sawgpus has categories babgpus and damspus? I think I'm confusing myself.\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, if A is B, then A is a subset of B, meaning that A is contained in B.\n\nBut in the statement \"sawgpus is babgpus and damspus\", it seems like sawgpus is being said to belong to both babgpus and damspus. But that would mean sawgpus is a subset of babgpus and also a subset of damspus.\n\nSimilarly, later we have \"jaqspus is sawgpus and mefspus\", so jaqspus is contained in sawgpus and mefspus? But that might not be right because if jaqspus is contained in sawgpus, and sawgpus is contained in babgpus, then jaqspus is contained in babgpus, but we need x to be in babgpus.\n\nLet's list all relations clearly.\n\nFrom the statements:\n\n- sawgpus is babgpus and damspus. → This means sawgpus ⊆ babgpus and sawgpus ⊆ damspus? Or does it mean that babgpus and damspus are categories that contain sawgpus? Based on the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so A ⊆ B. So if sawgpus is babgpus, that means sawgpus ⊆ babgpus. But typically, we think of B as a broader category, so if sawgpus is babgpus, it might mean that sawgpus is a type of babgpus.\n\nBut in the statement, it says \"sawgpus is babgpus and damspus\", which implies that sawgpus is both babgpus and damspus, so sawgpus ⊆ babgpus and sawgpus ⊆ damspus.\n\nSimilarly, for example, \"biykpus is mexzpus and dikbpus\" means biykpus ⊆ mexzpus and biykpus ⊆ dikbpus.\n\nSo, in general, \"A is B and C\" means A ⊆ B and A ⊆ C.\n\nNow, for babgpus, we need x to be in babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, babrpus: from \"qukcpus is babrpus and xotzpus\" so qukcpus ⊆ babrpus and qukcpus ⊆ xotzpus.\n\nAnd we need x to be in babrpus.\n\nSo, let's see if x is in babgpus and babrpus.\n\nFirst, let's find a path from x to babgpus.\n\nWe know x is ciwnpus (from x is ciwnpus).\n\nciwnpus is tidlpus and pirbpus. So ciwnpus ⊆ tidlpus and ciwnpus ⊆ pirbpus.\n\ntidlpus is silxpus. So tidlpus ⊆ silxpus.\n\nsilxpus is biykpus and wosgpus and fojbpus. So silxpus ⊆ biykpus, silxpus ⊆ wosgpus, silxpus ⊆ fojbpus.\n\nbiykpus is mexzpus and dikbpus. So biykpus ⊆ mexzpus and biykpus ⊆ dikbpus.\n\nmexzpus is mudrpus and wuwxpus and cumnpus. So mexzpus ⊆ mudrpus, etc.\n\nmudrpus is macbpus. So mudrpus ⊆ macbpus.\n\nmacbpus is fekkpus. So macbpus ⊆ fekkpus.\n\nfekkpus is jaqspus and mefjpus. So fekkpus ⊆ jaqspus and fekkpus ⊆ mefjpus.\n\njaqspus is sawgpus and mefspus. So jaqspus ⊆ sawgpus and jaqspus ⊆ mefspus.\n\nsawgpus is babgpus and damspus. So sawgpus ⊆ babgpus and sawgpus ⊆ damspus.\n\nTherefore, since jaqspus ⊆ sawgpus and sawgpus ⊆ babgpus, so jaqspus ⊆ babgpus.\n\nAnd since fekkpus ⊆ jaqspus, so fekkpus ⊆ babgpus.\n\nmacbpus ⊆ fekkpus, so macbpus ⊆ babgpus.\n\nmudrpus ⊆ macbpus, so mudrpus ⊆ babgpus.\n\nmexzpus ⊆ mudrpus, so mexzpus ⊆ babgpus.\n\nbiykpus ⊆ mexzpus, so biykpus ⊆ babgpus.\n\nsilxpus ⊆ biykpus, so silxpus ⊆ babgpus.\n\ntidlpus ⊆ silxpus, so tidlpus ⊆ babgpus.\n\nciwnpus ⊆ tidlpus, so ciwnpus ⊆ babgpus.\n\nAnd since x is ciwnpus, meaning x ⊆ ciwnpus? No: x is ciwnpus means that x is an instance of ciwnpus, or since x is a variable, it might represent a category, but from the question, \"x is babgpus\" probably means that x belongs to babgpus, so x is an instance or subset.\n\nIn the reasoning, when we say \"x is vokkpus\", it means x is contained in vokkpus, so x is a subset of vokkpus.\n\nSimilarly, for categories, if we have chains, we can trace the containment.\n\nSo, from above, since ciwnpus ⊆ babgpus, and x is ciwnpus (so x ⊆ ciwnpus), therefore x ⊆ babgpus, meaning x is contained in babgpus, so x is babgpus.\n\nThus, x is babgpus.\n\nNow, for babrpus.\n\nWe need x to be in babrpus.\n\nbabrpus is related to qukcpus, since qukcpus is babrpus and xotzpus, so qukcpus ⊆ babrpus.\n\nSo if we can connect x to qukcpus, then x might be in babrpus.\n\nNow, from x, we have other paths.\n\nWe know x is mirmpus (from x is mirmpus and xudmpus).\n\nmirmpus is hiktpus. So mirmpus ⊆ hiktpus.\n\nhiktpus is pacbpus and hehvpus. So hiktpus ⊆ pacbpus and hiktpus ⊆ hehvpus.\n\npacbpus is gexjpus. So pacbpus ⊆ gexjpus.\n\ngexjpus is viztpus and wermpus. So gexjpus ⊆ viztpus and gexjpus ⊆ wermpus.\n\nviztpus is qukcpus. So viztpus ⊆ qukcpus.\n\nTherefore, since gexjpus ⊆ viztpus and viztpus ⊆ qukcpus, so gexjpus ⊆ qukcpus.\n\npacbpus ⊆ gexjpus, so pacbpus ⊆ qukcpus.\n\nhiktpus ⊆ pacbpus, so hiktpus ⊆ qukcpus.\n\nmirmpus ⊆ hiktpus, so mirmpus ⊆ qukcpus.\n\nAnd since x is mirmpus, so x ⊆ mirmpus, thus x ⊆ qukcpus.\n\nAnd since qukcpus ⊆ babrpus, so x ⊆ babrpus, meaning x is babrpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babrpus.\n\nWe already have x is babspus from earlier.\n\nSo, overall, x is babgpus and babrpus and babspus.\n\nThus, the statement is true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any contradictions or missing links.\n\nFor babspus: we had x -> vokkpus -> wiqtpus -> wipkpus -> yaxvpus -> quczpus -> degvpus -> babspus.\n\nYes, since degvpus is babspus, so degvpus ⊆ babspus.\n\nAnd x ⊆ degvpus through the chain.\n\nSimilarly for babgpus: through ciwnpus -> tidlpus -> silxpus -> biykpus -> mexzpus -> mudrpus -> macbpus -> fekkpus -> jaqspus -> sawgpus -> babgpus.\n\nsawgpus is babgpus, so sawgpus ⊆ babgpus, and jaqspus ⊆ sawgpus, etc., so yes.\n\nFor babrpus: through mirmpus -> hiktpus -> pacbpus -> gexjpus -> viztpus -> qukcpus -> babrpus.\n\nviztpus is qukcpus, so viztpus ⊆ qukcpus, and qukcpus is babrpus, so qukcpus ⊆ babrpus.\n\nThus, all good.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babgpus and babrpus and babspus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

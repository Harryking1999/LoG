So I need to see if these categories are connected to x through the chain of \"is\" relationships.\n\nLet me list all the relevant statements:\n\n1. roftpus is juxypus and pevfpus.\n\n2. savlpus is tulspus.\n\n3. bibjpus is babrpus and bunzpus and docfpus.\n\n4. mabwpus is savlpus and xoycpus.\n\n5. liwvpus is fahjpus.\n\n6. x is mumppus and hobmpus.\n\n7. pijypus is fozxpus.\n\n8. qaztpus is muzzpus and nephpus.\n\n9. xaxdpus is roftpus and jikypus.\n\n10. jacjpus is qaztpus.\n\n11. fesbpus is xaxkpus.\n\n12. nugqpus is babgpus and migxpus and durlpus.\n\n13. fahjpus is ciqrpus.\n\n14. pitkpus is bancpus.\n\n15. yiqjpus is hurspus.\n\n16. lesrpus is nugqpus.\n\n17. ciqrpus is pijypus and muhvpus.\n\n18. x is nurhpus.\n\n19. xafppus is yiqjpus.\n\n20. juxypus is bibjpus.\n\n21. vidcpus is babspus and gemhpus and doctpus.\n\n22. tulspus is vidcpus.\n\n23. dofnpus is xafppus.\n\n24. wuxrpus is mabwpus.\n\n25. bancpus is xaxdpus and kupnpus and jibjpus.\n\n26. pinhpus is lesrpus.\n\n27. x is liwvpus and novtpus.\n\n28. mumppus is jacjpus and kivtpus and qipmpus.\n\n29. hurspus is viywpus.\n\n30. muzzpus is dofnpus.\n\n31. nurhpus is pitkpus and rodhpus.\n\n32. viywpus is wuxrpus.\n\n33. xaxkpus is pinhpus and comypus.\n\n34. fozxpus is fesbpus.\n\nNow, I need to focus on x. From statements 6, 18, and 27, we know that x is mumppus, hobmpus, nurhpus, liwvpus, and novtpus.\n\nI need to see if x is babgpus, babrpus, and babspus.\n\nLet's start with babrpus. From statement 3, bibjpus is babrpus. And from statement 20, juxypus is bibjpus. And from statement 1, roftpus is juxypus. And from statement 9, xaxdpus is roftpus. And from statement 25, bancpus is xaxdpus. And from statement 14, pitkpus is bancpus. And from statement 31, nurhpus is pitkpus and rodhpus. And from statement 18, x is nurhpus. So since x is nurhpus, and nurhpus is pitkpus, and pitkpus is bancpus, and bancpus is xaxdpus, and xaxdpus is roftpus, and roftpus is juxypus, and juxypus is bibjpus, and bibjpus is babrpus, therefore x is babrpus.\n\nLet me write that chain:\n\nx is nurhpus (18)\n\nnurhpus is pitkpus (31)\n\npitkpus is bancpus (14)\n\nbancpus is xaxdpus (25)\n\nxaxdpus is roftpus (9)\n\nroftpus is juxypus (1)\n\njuxypus is bibjpus (20)\n\nbibjpus is babrpus (3)\n\nSo, by transitivity, x is babrpus. Good.\n\nNow, next, babspus. From statement 21, vidcpus is babspus. And from statement 22, tulspus is vidcpus. And from statement 2, savlpus is tulspus. And from statement 4, mabwpus is savlpus and xoycpus. And from statement 24, wuxrpus is mabwpus. And from statement 32, viywpus is wuxrpus. And from statement 29, hurspus is viywpus. And from statement 15, yiqjpus is hurspus. And from statement 19, xafppus is yiqjpus. And from statement 30, muzzpus is dofnpus. dofnpus? Wait, from statement 23, dofnpus is xafppus? Let's see.\n\nStatement 23: dofnpus is xafppus? No, from the given: \"dofnpus is xafppus.\" But in statement 19, xafppus is yiqjpus. So dofnpus is xafppus, and xafppus is yiqjpus, so dofnpus is yiqjpus.\n\nBut I need to connect to x. How is x related to this chain?\n\nI also have from statement 28: mumppus is jacjpus and kivtpus and qipmpus. And from statement 10, jacjpus is qaztpus. And from statement 8, qaztpus is muzzpus and nephpus. And from statement 30, muzzpus is dofnpus. So let's see if we can connect x to dofnpus.\n\nx is mumppus (6)\n\nmumppus is jacjpus (28)\n\njacjpus is qaztpus (10)\n\nqaztpus is muzzpus (8)\n\nmuzzpus is dofnpus (30)\n\ndofnpus is xafppus (23)  // from given: \"dofnpus is xafppus\" – I think I missed that.

From statement 12, nugqpus is babgpus and migxpus and durlpus.\n\nAnd from statement 16, lesrpus is nugqpus.\n\nAnd from statement 26, pinhpus is lesrpus.\n\nAnd from statement 33, xaxkpus is pinhpus and comypus.\n\nAnd from statement 11, fesbpus is xaxkpus.\n\nAnd from statement 34, fozxpus is fesbpus.\n\nAnd from statement 7, pijypus is fozxpus.\n\nAnd from statement 17, ciqrpus is pijypus and muhvpus.\n\nAnd from statement 13, fahjpus is ciqrpus.\n\nAnd from statement 5, liwvpus is fahjpus.\n\nAnd from statement 27, x is liwvpus.\n\nSo, from x to babgpus:\n\nx is liwvpus (27)\n\nliwvpus is fahjpus (5)\n\nfahjpus is ciqrpus (13)\n\nciqrpus is pijypus (17)\n\npijypus is fozxpus (7)\n\nfozxpus is fesbpus (34)\n\nfesbpus is xaxkpus (11)\n\nxaxkpus is pinhpus (33)\n\npinhpus is lesrpus (26)\n\nlesrpus is nugqpus (16)\n\nnugqpus is babgpus (12)\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus.\n\nSo, indeed, x is babgpus, babrpus, and babspus.\n\nThe question is: Is it true or false or unknown? Based on this, it should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any contradictions or missing links.\n\nAlso, note that x is also other things, but that doesn't affect this.\n\nSo, for all three, we have chains leading to them.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.",

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

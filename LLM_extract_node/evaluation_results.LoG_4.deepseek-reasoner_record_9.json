  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the given information. We have several statements about categories:\n\n- x is zumtpus and kozcpus.\n\n- zumtpus is yoxtpus.\n\n- ciprpus is babqpus and wolypus.\n\n- wicgpus is ciprpus and qahppus.\n\n- zefrpus is wicgpus.\n\n- zumtpus is zefrpus.\n\nThe note says that \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B, not that A equals B. So, it's about set membership or subset relations.\n\nI need to find out if x is babdpus or babqpus. But babdpus isn't mentioned anywhere in the given information. Only babqpus is mentioned. So, I need to see if x is connected to babqpus through the categories.\n\nLet me list out all the categories and see how they are related.\n\nStart with x: x is zumtpus and kozcpus. So x belongs to zumtpus and also to kozcpus.\n\nzumtpus is yoxtpus. So zumtpus is a subset of yoxtpus or belongs to yoxtpus.\n\nAlso, zumtpus is zefrpus. So zumtpus belongs to zefrpus.\n\nNow, zefrpus is wicgpus. So zefrpus belongs to wicgpus.\n\nwicgpus is ciprpus and qahppus. So wicgpus belongs to ciprpus and also to qahppus.\n\nciprpus is babqpus and wolypus. So ciprpus belongs to babqpus and wolypus.\n\nI need to see if x is related to babqpus.\n\nSince x is zumtpus, and zumtpus is zefrpus, and zefrpus is wicgpus, and wicgpus is ciprpus, and ciprpus is babqpus, so by transitivity, zumtpus should be related to babqpus.\n\nBut let's be careful. The relationships are about belonging to categories, so if A is B, it means A is a member of B or A is a subset of B? The note says \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". So, it could be that A is an instance of B or that A is a subset of B.\n\nIn logic, this might be similar to class membership or subclass relationships.\n\nTo find if x is babqpus, I need to see if x is in the chain that leads to babqpus.\n\nFrom x: x is zumtpus.\n\nzumtpus is zefrpus.\n\nzefrpus is wicgpus.\n\nwicgpus is ciprpus.\n\nciprpus is babqpus.\n\nSo, since zumtpus is zefrpus, and zefrpus is wicgpus, etc., it seems that zumtpus is contained within wicgpus, which is contained within ciprpus, which is contained within babqpus. Therefore, zumtpus should be a subset of babqpus or belong to babqpus.\n\nBut we need to see if x is babqpus. Since x is zumtpus, and zumtpus is contained in babqpus, then x should be babqpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babdpus or babqpus?\" Since babdpus is not mentioned, we don't know anything about babdpus, so we cannot say that x is babdpus. But for babqpus, we might be able to say it is true.\n\nBut let's confirm the chain.\n\nWe have zumtpus is zefrpus.\n\nzefrpus is wicgpus.\n\nwicgpus is ciprpus. So since wicgpus is ciprpus, that means wicgpus belongs to ciprpus, so ciprpus is a broader category.\n\nThen ciprpus is babqpus, so ciprpus belongs to babqpus, meaning babqpus is even broader.\n\nSo, zumtpus is contained in zefrpus, which is contained in wicgpus, which is contained in ciprpus, which is contained in babqpus. Therefore, zumtpus is contained in babqpus.\n\nSince x is zumtpus, x is contained in zumtpus, so x is also contained in babqpus. Thus, x is babqpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babdpus or babqpus?\" Since x is babqpus, it is true that x is babqpus, so the OR statement is true because one part is true.\n\nBut we need to check if babdpus is involved. Since there is no information about babdpus, we cannot say x is babdpus, but since x is babqpus, the OR is true.\n\nSo, it should be true.\n\nBut let's make sure there are no contradictions or missing links.\n\nAlso, x is kozcpus, but kozcpus isn't connected to anything else, so it doesn't affect the question about babqpus.\n\nSo, based on the chain, x is babqpus.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"x is babdpus or babqpus\" is true because x is babqpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut the question says \"or babqpus\", and we have that.\n\nNow, to be thorough, let's see if zumtpus is directly connected to babqpus.\n\nFrom zumtpus to zefrpus to wicgpus to ciprpus to babqpus. Yes.\n\nAnd since \"is\" means belongs to, it should be transitive.\n\nFor example, if A is B and B is C, then A is C? Not necessarily, if \"is\" means instance of, but in category terms, if B is a category and A is in B, and B is in C, then A is in C only if C is a category that contains B. But from the statements, when we say \"ciprpus is babqpus\", it means ciprpus is contained in babqpus, so if something is in ciprpus, it is in babqpus.\n\nSimilarly, wicgpus is ciprpus, so wicgpus is in ciprpus, so anything in wicgpus is in ciprpus.\n\nzefrpus is wicgpus, so zefrpus is in wicgpus, so anything in zefrpus is in wicgpus.\n\nzumtpus is zefrpus, so zumtpus is in zefrpus.\n\nx is zumtpus, so x is in zumtpus.\n\nTherefore, x is in zefrpus, then in wicgpus, then in ciprpus, then in babqpus.\n\nSo yes, x is in babqpus.\n\nThus, x is babqpus.\n\nSo, for the OR statement, since x is babqpus, it is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is true.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nTherefore, the answer is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

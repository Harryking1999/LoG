(from \"fujwpus is waxcpus\")\n\nwaxcpus is boqxpus and kavzpus and lenvpus. This doesn't seem to lead to revdpus directly.\n\nNow, from maslpus to kovwpus.\n\nmaslpus is kovwpus and gebtpus.\n\nkovwpus is nasfpus and kellpus. (from \"kovwpus is nasfpus and kellpus\")\n\nnasfpus is capppus. (from \"nasfpus is capppus\")\n\ncapppus is docjpus and poltpus.

(from \"hixwpus is xopypus\")\n\nxopypus is dihjpus. (from \"xopypus is dihjpus\")\n\ndihjpus is hoplpus. (from \"dihjpus is hoplpus\")\n\nhoplpus is damdpus and qipcpus. (from \"hoplpus is damdpus and qipcpus\")\n\ndamdpus is teclpus. (from \"damdpus is teclpus\")\n\nteclpus is cupgpus and paskpus. (from \"teclpus is cupgpus and paskpus\")\n\ncupgpus is lihnpus. (from \"cupgpus is lihnpus\")\n\nlihnpus is wegrpus and gifvpus. (from \"lihnpus is wegrpus and gifvpus\")\n\nwegrpus is rukkpus and mudnpus. (from \"wegrpus is rukkpus and mudnpus\")\n\nrukkpus is revdpus. (from \"rukkpus is revdpus\")\n\nAnd revdpus is babbpus and babcpus and others.\n\nSo, through this long chain, we can see that x, which is hogspus, eventually leads to revdpus, which contains babbpus and babcpus.\n\nBut I need to confirm if x is directly babbpus and babcpus? The question is \"x is babbpus and babcpus?\" meaning x belongs to both categories.\n\nFrom the chain, since x is hogspus, and through the hierarchy, it should be contained in revdpus, which contains babbpus and babcpus. But does that mean x is specifically babbpus and babcpus? Or is it just that x is part of a larger set that includes babbpus and babcpus?\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B. So, if x is contained in revdpus, and revdpus contains babbpus and babcpus, that doesn't necessarily mean that x is babbpus or babcpus. It means that babbpus and babcpus are subsets of revdpus, but x might be another subset or part of the hierarchy.\n\nFor example, if revdpus is a category that includes babbpus, babcpus, etc., and x is contained in revdpus, then x could be babbpus or babcpus or something else. But to say x is babbpus, we need a direct chain or evidence that x is specifically babbpus.\n\nFrom the chain, we have x -> hogspus -> tannpus -> pamtpus -> cayzpus -> bomppus -> maslpus -> kovwpus -> nasfpus -> capppus -> docjpus -> fufspus -> cudcpus -> wabppus -> pagrpus -> viwkpus -> hixwpus -> xopypus -> dihjpus -> hoplpus -> damdpus -> teclpus -> cupgpus -> lihnpus -> wegrpus -> rukkpus -> revdpus\n\nSo, x is contained in revdpus. But revdpus has multiple parts: babbpus, babcpus, qegkpus, xosmpus. So, x might be one of these or might be contained in one of these, but from the chain, we don't know which one specifically.\n\nTherefore, we cannot say that x is babbpus and babcpus; we can only say that x is contained in revdpus, which contains babbpus and babcpus.\n\nBut the question is \"x is babbpus and babcpus?\" which would require that x is directly identified as babbpus and also as babcpus, which seems unlikely since babbpus and babcpus are distinct categories.\n\nFrom the information, revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, meaning that babbpus and babcpus are components of revdpus, so if x is revdpus, then x would be both, but x is not revdpus; x is contained in revdpus through a long chain.\n\nIn this containment hierarchy, if A is B and B is C, then A is C, meaning A is contained in C. So, since x is contained in revdpus, and revdpus contains babbpus, does that mean x is contained in babbpus? Not necessarily. Because revdpus contains babbpus, meaning babbpus is a subset of revdpus, but if x is in revdpus, it might not be in babbpus; it could be in another subset like babcpus or qegkpus.\n\nSimilarly, for x to be babbpus, we need a direct statement that x is babbpus or that x is contained in something that is babbpus.\n\nBut from the chain, we don't have any indication that x is directly babbpus or babcpus.\n\nWe have another path from maslpus: maslpus is also gebtpus, but gebtpus isn't defined further, so that might not help.\n\nAlso, from cayzpus, we have cayzpus is qigqpus and dotnpus, but that doesn't lead to revdpus.\n\nSo, the only path to revdpus is through the long chain above.\n\nBut in that chain, when we reach revdpus, we know that revdpus contains babbpus, but we don't know if x is specifically babbpus.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that x is babbpus and babcpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus and babcpus?\" which implies both, so we need to see if x is contained in babbpus and also contained in babcpus.\n\nBut from the information, babbpus and babcpus are both contained in revdpus, but they might be separate categories, so x could be in one but not the other.\n\nSince we have no direct link, it is unknown whether x is babbpus or babcpus.\n\nLet me see if there is a shorter path or another way.\n\nWe also have from the beginning: x is hogspus, and hogspus is tannpus, etc., but we also have from revdpus: revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, but we need to go backwards from babbpus to see what is babbpus.\n\nBut from the information, babbpus is only mentioned as part of revdpus, so we don't have any other things that are babbpus directly.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus.\n\nSo, to be babbpus, something must be directly stated as babbpus or contained in something that is babbpus.\n\nBut from the chain, x is contained in revdpus, but revdpus is not babbpus; revdpus contains babbpus, so for x to be babbpus, x must be contained in babbpus, but we have no information that x is contained in babbpus.\n\nIn other words, from \"revdpus is babbpus\" it means that babbpus is a subtype of revdpus, or that revdpus consists of babbpus among others. So, if something is revdpus, it is babbpus, but if something is contained in revdpus, it may not be babbpus; it could be another component.\n\nFor example, if revdpus is a set {babbpus, babcpus, ...}, then if x is an element of revdpus, x could be babbpus or babcpus, but if x is a subset of revdpus, x might contain multiple elements.\n\nBut in this context, from the statements, when we say \"A is B\", it means A belongs to B, so B is a category, and A is an instance or subset of B.\n\nSo, for revdpus, it is stated that revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, which means that revdpus is composed of babbpus and babcpus, so babbpus is a part of revdpus.\n\nBut for x, since x is contained in revdpus, x might be babbpus or might not be.\n\nWithout additional information, we cannot say that x is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus.\n\nTherefore, it is unknown whether x is babbpus and babcpus.\n\nBut let's see if there is any direct link.\n\nFrom the chain, we have wegrpus is rukkpus and mudnpus, and rukkpus is revdpus, so wegrpus contains rukkpus which is revdpus, so wegrpus contains revdpus.\n\nBut x is contained in wegrpus through lihnpus, cupgpus, teclpus, damdpus, hoplpus, dihjpus, xopypus, hixwpus, viwkpus, pagrpus, wabppus, cudcpus, fufspus, docjpus, capppus, nasfpus, kovwpus, maslpus, bomppus, cayzpus, pamtpus, tannpus, hogspus, which is x.\n\nSo, x is contained in wegrpus, and wegrpus contains revdpus, but that doesn't mean x is revdpus; it means x is part of wegrpus, which includes revdpus.\n\nBut revdpus itself contains babbpus.\n\nSo, x is not necessarily revdpus; x is a distant ancestor of revdpus.\n\nFor x to be babbpus, x must be directly babbpus or contained in something that is babbpus.\n\nBut from the information, nothing is stated to be babbpus except that revdpus is babbpus, which means that revdpus has the property of being babbpus, but that doesn't mean that everything in revdpus is babbpus.\n\nLet's think about the meaning of \"is\".\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\n\nSo, when we say \"revdpus is babbpus\", it means that revdpus belongs to category babbpus, or revdpus is contained in babbpus? But that would be confusing because usually, if A is B, it means A is a type of B, so B is a broader category.\n\nBut here, \"revdpus is babbpus\" might mean that revdpus is a type of babbpus, which would imply that babbpus is a broader category, but from the context, it seems that revdpus is composed of multiple things, so probably \"revdpus is babbpus\" means that revdpus has babbpus as a component, so rather than belonging, it might be that revdpus contains babbpus.\n\nI think there is ambiguity in the interpretation.\n\nLet's look at the note: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\"\n\nSo, for example, if A is B, it means B is a category, and A is in that category.\n\nBut when we say \"revdpus is babbpus\", if we interpret this as revdpus belongs to category babbpus, that would mean that babbpus is a category, and revdpus is an instance of it, so then anything that is revdpus is also babbpus.\n\nBut from the statement, \"revdpus is babbpus and babcpus\", so if revdpus belongs to category babbpus and also to category babcpus, then revdpus is both babbpus and babcpus.\n\nThen, if x is revdpus, then x would be babbpus and babcpus.\n\nBut is x revdpus? From the chain, x is contained in revdpus, but is x equal to revdpus? Probably not, because x is hogspus, and through the hierarchy, it is contained in revdpus, but revdpus is a node down the tree, so x is an ancestor of revdpus, so x is not revdpus itself.\n\nFor example, from the chain: lihnpus is wegrpus, and wegrpus is rukkpus and mudnpus, and rukkpus is revdpus, so lihnpus contains wegrpus, which contains rukkpus, which is revdpus, so lihnpus contains revdpus, but lihnpus is not revdpus; it is a larger category.\n\nSimilarly, x is hogspus, which is tannpus, etc., so x is at a higher level, so x contains revdpus indirectly, but x is not revdpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is not revdpus, and revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, but x is not revdpus, so x may not be babbpus or babcpus.\n\nIn fact, since x contains revdpus, x might be a category that includes babbpus and babcpus, but that doesn't mean x is babbpus; it means x has babbpus as a part.\n\nSo, for x to be babbpus, x must be specifically babbpus, which is not stated.\n\nTherefore, it is false that x is babbpus and babcpus? Or unknown?\n\nFrom the information, we can see that x is not babbpus because babbpus is a component of revdpus, and x is above revdpus, so x is not babbpus.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus.\n\nSo, it should be false that x is babbpus and babcpus.\n\nBut let's confirm with a smaller example.\n\nSuppose we have: A is B. B is C. C is D. And D is E and F.\n\nThen, is A E? Since A is B, B is C, C is D, so A is D, and D is E, so if D is E means that D belongs to E, then A is D implies A belongs to D, and D belongs to E, so A belongs to E, so A is E.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, if we have x is revdpus, and revdpus is babbpus, then x is babbpus.\n\nBut in this case, is x revdpus? From the chain, we have x is contained in revdpus, but is x revdpus? Let's see the direction.\n\nFrom the statements, when we say \"A is B\", it means A belongs to B, so B is a broader category.\n\nSo, for example, viwkpus is hixwpus, so viwkpus belongs to hixwpus, so hixwpus is a category containing viwkpus.\n\nSimilarly, hogspus is tannpus, so tannpus is a category containing hogspus.\n\nNow, from tannpus is pamtpus, so tannpus belongs to pamtpus, so pamtpus is a broader category containing tannpus.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, eventually, we have wegrpus is rukkpus and mudnpus, so wegrpus belongs to rukkpus and to mudnpus? That doesn't make sense because if wegrpus belongs to rukkpus, then rukkpus is a category containing wegrpus, but then rukkpus is revdpus, so rukkpus belongs to revdpus? Let's see.\n\nrukkpus is revdpus, so rukkpus belongs to revdpus, meaning revdpus is a category containing rukkpus.\n\nBut from wegrpus is rukkpus, so wegrpus belongs to rukkpus, so wegrpus is contained in rukkpus, and rukkpus is contained in revdpus, so wegrpus is contained in revdpus.\n\nSimilarly, from lihnpus is wegrpus, so lihnpus belongs to wegrpus, so lihnpus is contained in wegrpus, which is contained in revdpus, so lihnpus is contained in revdpus.\n\nAnd so on, back to x: x is hogspus, hogspus is tannpus, tannpus is pamtpus, pamtpus is cayzpus, cayzpus is bomppus, bomppus is maslpus, maslpus is kovwpus, kovwpus is nasfpus, nasfpus is capppus, capppus is docjpus, docjpus is fufspus, fufspus is cudcpus, cudcpus is wabppus, wabppus is pagrpus, pagrpus is viwkpus, viwkpus is hixwpus, hixwpus is xopypus, xopypus is dihjpus, dihjpus is hoplpus, hoplpus is damdpus, damdpus is teclpus, teclpus is cupgpus, cupgpus is lihnpus, lihnpus is wegrpus, wegrpus is rukkpus, and rukkpus is revdpus.\n\nSo, from this, since each \"is\" means belongs to, we have that hogspus belongs to tannpus, so hogspus is contained in tannpus, which is contained in pamtpus, and so on, down to lihnpus contained in wegrpus, which is contained in rukkpus, which is contained in revdpus.\n\nTherefore, hogspus is contained in revdpus.\n\nNow, revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, meaning that revdpus belongs to babbpus and to babcpus? Or does it mean that babbpus and babcpus are contained in revdpus?\n\nAccording to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so when we say \"revdpus is babbpus\", it means revdpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus is a category that contains revdpus.\n\nSimilarly, revdpus belongs to babcpus, so babcpus contains revdpus.\n\nTherefore, since hogspus is contained in revdpus, and revdpus is contained in babbpus, then hogspus is contained in babbpus, so hogspus belongs to babbpus, so x is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, since revdpus is contained in babcpus, hogspus is contained in babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is both babbpus and babcpus.\n\nThat makes sense based on the transitive property of belonging.\n\nSo, in this case, it should be true that x is babbpus and babcpus.\n\nLet me write the chain clearly.\n\nWe have:\n\nx is hogspus.\n\nhogspus is tannpus → so x is contained in tannpus.\n\ntannpus is pamtpus → so tannpus contained in pamtpus, so x contained in pamtpus.\n\npamtpus is cayzpus → so pamtpus contained in cayzpus, so x contained in cayzpus.\n\ncayzpus is bomppus → so cayzpus contained in bomppus, so x contained in bomppus.\n\nbomppus is maslpus → so bomppus contained in maslpus, so x contained in maslpus.\n\nmaslpus is kovwpus → so maslpus contained in kovwpus, so x contained in kovwpus. (also maslpus is gebtpus, but we don't need that for this chain)\n\nkovwpus is nasfpus → so kovwpus contained in nasfpus, so x contained in nasfpus.\n\nnasfpus is capppus → so nasfpus contained in capppus, so x contained in capppus.\n\ncapppus is docjpus → so capppus contained in docjpus, so x contained in docjpus.\n\ndocjpus is fufspus → so docjpus contained in fufspus, so x contained in fufspus.\n\nfufspus is cudcpus → so fufspus contained in cudcpus, so x contained in cudcpus.\n\ncudcpus is wabppus → so cudcpus contained in wabppus, so x contained in wabppus.\n\nwabppus is pagrpus → so wabppus contained in pagrpus, so x contained in pagrpus.\n\npagrpus is viwkpus → so pagrpus contained in viwkpus, so x contained in viwkpus.\n\nviwkpus is hixwpus → so viwkpus contained in hixwpus, so x contained in hixwpus.\n\nhixwpus is xopypus → so hixwpus contained in xopypus, so x contained in xopypus.\n\nxopypus is dihjpus → so xopypus contained in dihjpus, so x contained in dihjpus.\n\ndihjpus is hoplpus → so dihjpus contained in hoplpus, so x contained in hoplpus.\n\nhoplpus is damdpus → so hoplpus contained in damdpus, so x contained in damdpus.\n\ndamdpus is teclpus → so damdpus contained in teclpus, so x contained in teclpus.\n\nteclpus is cupgpus → so teclpus contained in cupgpus, so x contained in cupgpus.\n\ncupgpus is lihnpus → so cupgpus contained in lihnpus, so x contained in lihnpus.\n\nlihnpus is wegrpus → so lihnpus contained in wegrpus, so x contained in wegrpus.\n\nwegrpus is rukkpus → so wegrpus contained in rukkpus, so x contained in rukkpus.\n\nrukkpus is revdpus → so rukkpus contained in revdpus, so x contained in revdpus.\n\nNow, revdpus is babbpus → so revdpus contained in babbpus, therefore x contained in babbpus, so x is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, revdpus is babcpus → so revdpus contained in babcpus, therefore x contained in babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is both babbpus and babcpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nI think I initially misinterpreted the direction of \"is\". But based on the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so B is the container, A is the contained.\n\nSo, in the statement \"revdpus is babbpus\", it means revdpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus contains revdpus.\n\nThus, through transitivity, x is contained in babbpus.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus.\n\nHence, it is true.",

(from \"wegrpus is rukkpus and mudnpus\")\n\nrukkpus is revdpus. (from \"rukkpus is revdpus\")\n\nAnd revdpus is babbpus and babcpus and others.\n\nSo, through this long chain, we can see that x, which is hogspus, eventually leads to revdpus, which contains babbpus and babcpus.\n\nBut I need to confirm if x is directly babbpus and babcpus? The question is \"x is babbpus and babcpus?\" meaning x belongs to both categories.\n\nFrom the chain, since x is hogspus, and through the hierarchy, it should be contained in revdpus, which contains babbpus and babcpus. But does that mean x is specifically babbpus and babcpus? Or is it just that x is part of a larger set that includes babbpus and babcpus?\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B. So, if x is contained in revdpus, and revdpus contains babbpus and babcpus, that doesn't necessarily mean that x is babbpus or babcpus. It means that babbpus and babcpus are subsets of revdpus, but x might be another subset or part of the hierarchy.\n\nFor example, if revdpus is a category that includes babbpus, babcpus, etc., and x is contained in revdpus, then x could be babbpus or babcpus or something else. But to say x is babbpus, we need a direct chain or evidence that x is specifically babbpus.\n\nFrom the chain, we have x -> hogspus -> tannpus -> pamtpus -> cayzpus -> bomppus -> maslpus -> kovwpus -> nasfpus -> capppus -> docjpus -> fufspus -> cudcpus -> wabppus -> pagrpus -> viwkpus -> hixwpus -> xopypus -> dihjpus -> hoplpus -> damdpus -> teclpus -> cupgpus -> lihnpus -> wegrpus -> rukkpus -> revdpus\n\nSo, x is contained in revdpus. But revdpus has multiple parts: babbpus, babcpus, qegkpus, xosmpus. So, x might be one of these or might be contained in one of these, but from the chain, we don't know which one specifically.\n\nTherefore, we cannot say that x is babbpus and babcpus; we can only say that x is contained in revdpus, which contains babbpus and babcpus.\n\nBut the question is \"x is babbpus and babcpus?\" which would require that x is directly identified as babbpus and also as babcpus, which seems unlikely since babbpus and babcpus are distinct categories.\n\nFrom the information, revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, meaning that babbpus and babcpus are components of revdpus, so if x is revdpus, then x would be both, but x is not revdpus; x is contained in revdpus through a long chain.\n\nIn this containment hierarchy, if A is B and B is C, then A is C, meaning A is contained in C. So, since x is contained in revdpus, and revdpus contains babbpus, does that mean x is contained in babbpus? Not necessarily. Because revdpus contains babbpus, meaning babbpus is a subset of revdpus, but if x is in revdpus, it might not be in babbpus; it could be in another subset like babcpus or qegkpus.\n\nSimilarly, for x to be babbpus, we need a direct statement that x is babbpus or that x is contained in something that is babbpus.\n\nBut from the chain, we don't have any indication that x is directly babbpus or babcpus.\n\nWe have another path from maslpus: maslpus is also gebtpus, but gebtpus isn't defined further, so that might not help.\n\nAlso, from cayzpus, we have cayzpus is qigqpus and dotnpus, but that doesn't lead to revdpus.\n\nSo, the only path to revdpus is through the long chain above.\n\nBut in that chain, when we reach revdpus, we know that revdpus contains babbpus, but we don't know if x is specifically babbpus.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that x is babbpus and babcpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus and babcpus?\" which implies both, so we need to see if x is contained in babbpus and also contained in babcpus.\n\nBut from the information, babbpus and babcpus are both contained in revdpus, but they might be separate categories, so x could be in one but not the other.\n\nSince we have no direct link, it is unknown whether x is babbpus or babcpus.\n\nLet me see if there is a shorter path or another way.\n\nWe also have from the beginning: x is hogspus, and hogspus is tannpus, etc., but we also have from revdpus: revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, but we need to go backwards from babbpus to see what is babbpus.\n\nBut from the information, babbpus is only mentioned as part of revdpus, so we don't have any other things that are babbpus directly.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus.\n\nSo, to be babbpus, something must be directly stated as babbpus or contained in something that is babbpus.\n\nBut from the chain, x is contained in revdpus, but revdpus is not babbpus; revdpus contains babbpus, so for x to be babbpus, x must be contained in babbpus, but we have no information that x is contained in babbpus.\n\nIn other words, from \"revdpus is babbpus\" it means that babbpus is a subtype of revdpus, or that revdpus consists of babbpus among others. So, if something is revdpus, it is babbpus, but if something is contained in revdpus, it may not be babbpus; it could be another component.\n\nFor example, if revdpus is a set {babbpus, babcpus, ...}, then if x is an element of revdpus, x could be babbpus or babcpus, but if x is a subset of revdpus, x might contain multiple elements.\n\nBut in this context, from the statements, when we say \"A is B\", it means A belongs to B, so B is a category, and A is an instance or subset of B.\n\nSo, for revdpus, it is stated that revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, which means that revdpus is composed of babbpus and babcpus, so babbpus is a part of revdpus.\n\nBut for x, since x is contained in revdpus, x might be babbpus or might not be.\n\nWithout additional information, we cannot say that x is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus.\n\nTherefore, it is unknown whether x is babbpus and babcpus.\n\nBut let's see if there is any direct link.\n\nFrom the chain, we have wegrpus is rukkpus and mudnpus, and rukkpus is revdpus, so wegrpus contains rukkpus which is revdpus, so wegrpus contains revdpus.\n\nBut x is contained in wegrpus through lihnpus, cupgpus, teclpus, damdpus, hoplpus, dihjpus, xopypus, hixwpus, viwkpus, pagrpus, wabppus, cudcpus, fufspus, docjpus, capppus, nasfpus, kovwpus, maslpus, bomppus, cayzpus, pamtpus, tannpus, hogspus, which is x.\n\nSo, x is contained in wegrpus, and wegrpus contains revdpus, but that doesn't mean x is revdpus; it means x is part of wegrpus, which includes revdpus.\n\nBut revdpus itself contains babbpus.\n\nSo, x is not necessarily revdpus; x is a distant ancestor of revdpus.\n\nFor x to be babbpus, x must be directly babbpus or contained in something that is babbpus.\n\nBut from the information, nothing is stated to be babbpus except that revdpus is babbpus, which means that revdpus has the property of being babbpus, but that doesn't mean that everything in revdpus is babbpus.\n\nLet's think about the meaning of \"is\".\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\n\nSo, when we say \"revdpus is babbpus\", it means that revdpus belongs to category babbpus, or revdpus is contained in babbpus? But that would be confusing because usually, if A is B, it means A is a type of B, so B is a broader category.\n\nBut here, \"revdpus is babbpus\" might mean that revdpus is a type of babbpus, which would imply that babbpus is a broader category, but from the context, it seems that revdpus is composed of multiple things, so probably \"revdpus is babbpus\" means that revdpus has babbpus as a component, so rather than belonging, it might be that revdpus contains babbpus.\n\nI think there is ambiguity in the interpretation.\n\nLet's look at the note: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\"\n\nSo, for example, if A is B, it means B is a category, and A is in that category.\n\nBut when we say \"revdpus is babbpus\", if we interpret this as revdpus belongs to category babbpus, that would mean that babbpus is a category, and revdpus is an instance of it, so then anything that is revdpus is also babbpus.\n\nBut from the statement, \"revdpus is babbpus and babcpus\", so if revdpus belongs to category babbpus and also to category babcpus, then revdpus is both babbpus and babcpus.\n\nThen, if x is revdpus, then x would be babbpus and babcpus.\n\nBut is x revdpus? From the chain, x is contained in revdpus, but is x equal to revdpus? Probably not, because x is hogspus, and through the hierarchy, it is contained in revdpus, but revdpus is a node down the tree, so x is an ancestor of revdpus, so x is not revdpus itself.\n\nFor example, from the chain: lihnpus is wegrpus, and wegrpus is rukkpus and mudnpus, and rukkpus is revdpus, so lihnpus contains wegrpus, which contains rukkpus, which is revdpus, so lihnpus contains revdpus, but lihnpus is not revdpus; it is a larger category.\n\nSimilarly, x is hogspus, which is tannpus, etc., so x is at a higher level, so x contains revdpus indirectly, but x is not revdpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is not revdpus, and revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, but x is not revdpus, so x may not be babbpus or babcpus.\n\nIn fact, since x contains revdpus, x might be a category that includes babbpus and babcpus, but that doesn't mean x is babbpus; it means x has babbpus as a part.\n\nSo, for x to be babbpus, x must be specifically babbpus, which is not stated.\n\nTherefore, it is false that x is babbpus and babcpus? Or unknown?\n\nFrom the information, we can see that x is not babbpus because babbpus is a component of revdpus, and x is above revdpus, so x is not babbpus.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus.\n\nSo, it should be false that x is babbpus and babcpus.\n\nBut let's confirm with a smaller example.\n\nSuppose we have: A is B. B is C. C is D. And D is E and F.\n\nThen, is A E? Since A is B, B is C, C is D, so A is D, and D is E, so if D is E means that D belongs to E, then A is D implies A belongs to D, and D belongs to E, so A belongs to E, so A is E.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, if we have x is revdpus, and revdpus is babbpus, then x is babbpus.\n\nBut in this case, is x revdpus? From the chain, we have x is contained in revdpus, but is x revdpus? Let's see the direction.\n\nFrom the statements, when we say \"A is B\", it means A belongs to B, so B is a broader category.\n\nSo, for example, viwkpus is hixwpus, so viwkpus belongs to hixwpus, so hixwpus is a category containing viwkpus.\n\nSimilarly, hogspus is tannpus, so tannpus is a category containing hogspus.\n\nNow, from tannpus is pamtpus, so tannpus belongs to pamtpus, so pamtpus is a broader category containing tannpus.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, eventually, we have wegrpus is rukkpus and mudnpus, so wegrpus belongs to rukkpus and to mudnpus? That doesn't make sense because if wegrpus belongs to rukkpus, then rukkpus is a category containing wegrpus, but then rukkpus is revdpus, so rukkpus belongs to revdpus? Let's see.\n\nrukkpus is revdpus, so rukkpus belongs to revdpus, meaning revdpus is a category containing rukkpus.\n\nBut from wegrpus is rukkpus, so wegrpus belongs to rukkpus, so wegrpus is contained in rukkpus, and rukkpus is contained in revdpus, so wegrpus is contained in revdpus.\n\nSimilarly, from lihnpus is wegrpus, so lihnpus belongs to wegrpus, so lihnpus is contained in wegrpus, which is contained in revdpus, so lihnpus is contained in revdpus.\n\nAnd so on, back to x: x is hogspus, hogspus is tannpus, tannpus is pamtpus, pamtpus is cayzpus, cayzpus is bomppus, bomppus is maslpus, maslpus is kovwpus, kovwpus is nasfpus, nasfpus is capppus, capppus is docjpus, docjpus is fufspus, fufspus is cudcpus, cudcpus is wabppus, wabppus is pagrpus, pagrpus is viwkpus, viwkpus is hixwpus, hixwpus is xopypus, xopypus is dihjpus, dihjpus is hoplpus, hoplpus is damdpus, damdpus is teclpus, teclpus is cupgpus, cupgpus is lihnpus, lihnpus is wegrpus, wegrpus is rukkpus, and rukkpus is revdpus.\n\nSo, from this, since each \"is\" means belongs to, we have that hogspus belongs to tannpus, so hogspus is contained in tannpus, which is contained in pamtpus, and so on, down to lihnpus contained in wegrpus, which is contained in rukkpus, which is contained in revdpus.\n\nTherefore, hogspus is contained in revdpus.\n\nNow, revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, meaning that revdpus belongs to babbpus and to babcpus? Or does it mean that babbpus and babcpus are contained in revdpus?\n\nAccording to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so when we say \"revdpus is babbpus\", it means revdpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus is a category that contains revdpus.\n\nSimilarly, revdpus belongs to babcpus, so babcpus contains revdpus.\n\nTherefore, since hogspus is contained in revdpus, and revdpus is contained in babbpus, then hogspus is contained in babbpus, so hogspus belongs to babbpus, so x is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, since revdpus is contained in babcpus, hogspus is contained in babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is both babbpus and babcpus.\n\nThat makes sense based on the transitive property of belonging.\n\nSo, in this case, it should be true that x is babbpus and babcpus.\n\nLet me write the chain clearly.\n\nWe have:\n\nx is hogspus.\n\nhogspus is tannpus → so x is contained in tannpus.\n\ntannpus is pamtpus → so tannpus contained in pamtpus, so x contained in pamtpus.\n\npamtpus is cayzpus → so pamtpus contained in cayzpus, so x contained in cayzpus.\n\ncayzpus is bomppus → so cayzpus contained in bomppus, so x contained in bomppus.\n\nbomppus is maslpus → so bomppus contained in maslpus, so x contained in maslpus.\n\nmaslpus is kovwpus → so maslpus contained in kovwpus, so x contained in kovwpus. (also maslpus is gebtpus, but we don't need that for this chain)\n\nkovwpus is nasfpus → so kovwpus contained in nasfpus, so x contained in nasfpus.\n\nnasfpus is capppus → so nasfpus contained in capppus, so x contained in capppus.\n\ncapppus is docjpus → so capppus contained in docjpus, so x contained in docjpus.\n\ndocjpus is fufspus → so docjpus contained in fufspus, so x contained in fufspus.\n\nfufspus is cudcpus → so fufspus contained in cudcpus, so x contained in cudcpus.\n\ncudcpus is wabppus → so cudcpus contained in wabppus, so x contained in wabppus.\n\nwabppus is pagrpus → so wabppus contained in pagrpus, so x contained in pagrpus.\n\npagrpus is viwkpus → so pagrpus contained in viwkpus, so x contained in viwkpus.\n\nviwkpus is hixwpus → so viwkpus contained in hixwpus, so x contained in hixwpus.\n\nhixwpus is xopypus → so hixwpus contained in xopypus, so x contained in xopypus.\n\nxopypus is dihjpus → so xopypus contained in dihjpus, so x contained in dihjpus.\n\ndihjpus is hoplpus → so dihjpus contained in hoplpus, so x contained in hoplpus.\n\nhoplpus is damdpus → so hoplpus contained in damdpus, so x contained in damdpus.\n\ndamdpus is teclpus → so damdpus contained in teclpus, so x contained in teclpus.\n\nteclpus is cupgpus → so teclpus contained in cupgpus, so x contained in cupgpus.\n\ncupgpus is lihnpus → so cupgpus contained in lihnpus, so x contained in lihnpus.\n\nlihnpus is wegrpus → so lihnpus contained in wegrpus, so x contained in wegrpus.\n\nwegrpus is rukkpus → so wegrpus contained in rukkpus, so x contained in rukkpus.\n\nrukkpus is revdpus → so rukkpus contained in revdpus, so x contained in revdpus.\n\nNow, revdpus is babbpus → so revdpus contained in babbpus, therefore x contained in babbpus, so x is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, revdpus is babcpus → so revdpus contained in babcpus, therefore x contained in babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nTherefore, x is both babbpus and babcpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nI think I initially misinterpreted the direction of \"is\". But based on the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so B is the container, A is the contained.\n\nSo, in the statement \"revdpus is babbpus\", it means revdpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus contains revdpus.\n\nThus, through transitivity, x is contained in babbpus.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus.\n\nHence, it is true.",

    "Also, from cayzpus, we have cayzpus is qigqpus and dotnpus, but that doesn't lead to revdpus.",
    "So, the only path to revdpus is through the long chain above.",
    "But in that chain, when we reach revdpus, we know that revdpus contains babbpus, but we don't know if x is specifically babbpus.",
    "Therefore, we cannot conclude that x is babbpus and babcpus.",
    "The question is \"x is babbpus and babcpus?",
    "\" which implies both, so we need to see if x is contained in babbpus and also contained in babcpus.",
    "But from the information, babbpus and babcpus are both contained in revdpus, but they might be separate categories, so x could be in one but not the other.",
    "Since we have no direct link, it is unknown whether x is babbpus or babcpus.",
    "Let me see if there is a shorter path or another way.",
    "We also have from the beginning: x is hogspus, and hogspus is tannpus, etc.",
    ", but we also have from revdpus: revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, but we need to go backwards from babbpus to see what is babbpus.",
    "But from the information, babbpus is only mentioned as part of revdpus, so we don't have any other things that are babbpus directly.",
    "Similarly for babcpus.",
    "So, to be babbpus, something must be directly stated as babbpus or contained in something that is babbpus.",
    "But from the chain, x is contained in revdpus, but revdpus is not babbpus; revdpus contains babbpus, so for x to be babbpus, x must be contained in babbpus, but we have no information that x is contained in babbpus.",
    "In other words, from \"revdpus is babbpus\" it means that babbpus is a subtype of revdpus, or that revdpus consists of babbpus among others.",
    "So, if something is revdpus, it is babbpus, but if something is contained in revdpus, it may not be babbpus; it could be another component.",
    "For example, if revdpus is a set {babbpus, babcpus,.",
    "}, then if x is an element of revdpus, x could be babbpus or babcpus, but if x is a subset of revdpus, x might contain multiple elements.",
    "But in this context, from the statements, when we say \"A is B\", it means A belongs to B, so B is a category, and A is an instance or subset of B.",
    "So, for revdpus, it is stated that revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, which means that revdpus is composed of babbpus and babcpus, so babbpus is a part of revdpus.",
    "But for x, since x is contained in revdpus, x might be babbpus or might not be.",
    "Without additional information, we cannot say that x is babbpus.",
    "Similarly for babcpus.",
    "Therefore, it is unknown whether x is babbpus and babcpus.",
    "But let's see if there is any direct link.",
    "From the chain, we have wegrpus is rukkpus and mudnpus, and rukkpus is revdpus, so wegrpus contains rukkpus which is revdpus, so wegrpus contains revdpus.",
    "But x is contained in wegrpus through lihnpus, cupgpus, teclpus, damdpus, hoplpus, dihjpus, xopypus, hixwpus, viwkpus, pagrpus, wabppus, cudcpus, fufspus, docjpus, capppus, nasfpus, kovwpus, maslpus, bomppus, cayzpus, pamtpus, tannpus, hogspus, which is x.",
    "So, x is contained in wegrpus, and wegrpus contains revdpus, but that doesn't mean x is revdpus; it means x is part of wegrpus, which includes revdpus.",
    "But revdpus itself contains babbpus.",
    "So, x is not necessarily revdpus; x is a distant ancestor of revdpus.",
    "For x to be babbpus, x must be directly babbpus or contained in something that is babbpus.",
    "But from the information, nothing is stated to be babbpus except that revdpus is babbpus, which means that revdpus has the property of being babbpus, but that doesn't mean that everything in revdpus is babbpus.",
    "Let's think about the meaning of \"is\".",
    "The note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.",
    "So, when we say \"revdpus is babbpus\", it means that revdpus belongs to category babbpus, or revdpus is contained in babbpus?",
    "But that would be confusing because usually, if A is B, it means A is a type of B, so B is a broader category.",
    "But here, \"revdpus is babbpus\" might mean that revdpus is a type of babbpus, which would imply that babbpus is a broader category, but from the context, it seems that revdpus is composed of multiple things, so probably \"revdpus is babbpus\" means that revdpus has babbpus as a component, so rather than belonging, it might be that revdpus contains babbpus.",
    "I think there is ambiguity in the interpretation.",
    "Let's look at the note: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.",
    "\"",
    "So, for example, if A is B, it means B is a category, and A is in that category.",
    "But when we say \"revdpus is babbpus\", if we interpret this as revdpus belongs to category babbpus, that would mean that babbpus is a category, and revdpus is an instance of it, so then anything that is revdpus is also babbpus.",
    "But from the statement, \"revdpus is babbpus and babcpus\", so if revdpus belongs to category babbpus and also to category babcpus, then revdpus is both babbpus and babcpus.",
    "Then, if x is revdpus, then x would be babbpus and babcpus.",
    "But is x revdpus?",
    "From the chain, x is contained in revdpus, but is x equal to revdpus?",
    "Probably not, because x is hogspus, and through the hierarchy, it is contained in revdpus, but revdpus is a node down the tree, so x is an ancestor of revdpus, so x is not revdpus itself.",
    "For example, from the chain: lihnpus is wegrpus, and wegrpus is rukkpus and mudnpus, and rukkpus is revdpus, so lihnpus contains wegrpus, which contains rukkpus, which is revdpus, so lihnpus contains revdpus, but lihnpus is not revdpus; it is a larger category.",
    "Similarly, x is hogspus, which is tannpus, etc.",
    ", so x is at a higher level, so x contains revdpus indirectly, but x is not revdpus.",
    "Therefore, since x is not revdpus, and revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, but x is not revdpus, so x may not be babbpus or babcpus.",
    "In fact, since x contains revdpus, x might be a category that includes babbpus and babcpus, but that doesn't mean x is babbpus; it means x has babbpus as a part.",
    "So, for x to be babbpus, x must be specifically babbpus, which is not stated.",
    "Therefore, it is false that x is babbpus and babcpus?",
    "Or unknown?",
    "From the information, we can see that x is not babbpus because babbpus is a component of revdpus, and x is above revdpus, so x is not babbpus.",
    "Similarly for babcpus.",
    "So, it should be false that x is babbpus and babcpus.",
    "But let's confirm with a smaller example.",
    "Suppose we have: A is B.",
    "B is C.",
    "C is D.",
    "And D is E and F.",
    "Then, is A E?",
    "Since A is B, B is C, C is D, so A is D, and D is E, so if D is E means that D belongs to E, then A is D implies A belongs to D, and D belongs to E, so A belongs to E, so A is E.",
    "Similarly, in this case, if we have x is revdpus, and revdpus is babbpus, then x is babbpus.",
    "But in this case, is x revdpus?",
    "From the chain, we have x is contained in revdpus, but is x revdpus?",
    "Let's see the direction.",
    "From the statements, when we say \"A is B\", it means A belongs to B, so B is a broader category.",
    "So, for example, viwkpus is hixwpus, so viwkpus belongs to hixwpus, so hixwpus is a category containing viwkpus.",
    "Similarly, hogspus is tannpus, so tannpus is a category containing hogspus.",
    "Now, from tannpus is pamtpus, so tannpus belongs to pamtpus, so pamtpus is a broader category containing tannpus.",
    "And so on.",
    "So, eventually, we have wegrpus is rukkpus and mudnpus, so wegrpus belongs to rukkpus and to mudnpus?",
    "That doesn't make sense because if wegrpus belongs to rukkpus, then rukkpus is a category containing wegrpus, but then rukkpus is revdpus, so rukkpus belongs to revdpus?",
    "Let's see.",
    "rukkpus is revdpus, so rukkpus belongs to revdpus, meaning revdpus is a category containing rukkpus.",
    "But from wegrpus is rukkpus, so wegrpus belongs to rukkpus, so wegrpus is contained in rukkpus, and rukkpus is contained in revdpus, so wegrpus is contained in revdpus.",
    "Similarly, from lihnpus is wegrpus, so lihnpus belongs to wegrpus, so lihnpus is contained in wegrpus, which is contained in revdpus, so lihnpus is contained in revdpus.",
    "And so on, back to x: x is hogspus, hogspus is tannpus, tannpus is pamtpus, pamtpus is cayzpus, cayzpus is bomppus, bomppus is maslpus, maslpus is kovwpus, kovwpus is nasfpus, nasfpus is capppus, capppus is docjpus, docjpus is fufspus, fufspus is cudcpus, cudcpus is wabppus, wabppus is pagrpus, pagrpus is viwkpus, viwkpus is hixwpus, hixwpus is xopypus, xopypus is dihjpus, dihjpus is hoplpus, hoplpus is damdpus, damdpus is teclpus, teclpus is cupgpus, cupgpus is lihnpus, lihnpus is wegrpus, wegrpus is rukkpus, and rukkpus is revdpus.",
    "So, from this, since each \"is\" means belongs to, we have that hogspus belongs to tannpus, so hogspus is contained in tannpus, which is contained in pamtpus, and so on, down to lihnpus contained in wegrpus, which is contained in rukkpus, which is contained in revdpus.",
    "Therefore, hogspus is contained in revdpus.",
    "Now, revdpus is babbpus and babcpus, meaning that revdpus belongs to babbpus and to babcpus?",
    "Or does it mean that babbpus and babcpus are contained in revdpus?",
    "According to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so when we say \"revdpus is babbpus\", it means revdpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus is a category that contains revdpus.",
    "Similarly, revdpus belongs to babcpus, so babcpus contains revdpus.",
    "Therefore, since hogspus is contained in revdpus, and revdpus is contained in babbpus, then hogspus is contained in babbpus, so hogspus belongs to babbpus, so x is babbpus.",
    "Similarly, since revdpus is contained in babcpus, hogspus is contained in babcpus, so x is babcpus.",
    "Therefore, x is both babbpus and babcpus.",
    "That makes sense based on the transitive property of belonging.",
    "So, in this case, it should be true that x is babbpus and babcpus.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11.

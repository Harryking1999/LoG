  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x belongs to the categories babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus. The given information is a list of statements where \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B.\n\nI recall that x is mentioned in the information. Let me find where x is defined.\n\nFrom the information:\n\n- \"x is repgpus.\" and \"x is cupjpus.\" and \"x is jiqhpus.\" So x is multiple things? But in the context, since \"is\" means belongs to, x might belong to multiple categories. But for the question, I need to see if x belongs to babgpus, etc.\n\nActually, looking back: \"x is repgpus.\" and later \"x is cupjpus.\" and \"x is jiqhpus.\" This might mean that x is contained in repgpus, cupjpus, and jiqhpus. But I need to find what x is directly.\n\nPerhaps x is a variable that is defined in terms of other categories. But in the question, it's asking about x, so I need to trace what x is.\n\nLet me list all statements that mention x:\n\n- \"x is repgpus.\"\n\n- \"x is cupjpus.\"\n\n- \"x is jiqhpus.\"\n\nSo, from this, x belongs to repgpus, cupjpus, and jiqhpus. But for the question, I need to see if x belongs to babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus.\n\nI need to find out what babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus are, and see if x is connected to them.\n\nFirst, let's find babgpus. I see \"faktpus is babgpus and denrpus and giqgpus and huhqpus.\" So faktpus contains babgpus, among others. But I need to know if x is in babgpus, which means I need to see if x is in faktpus or something that contains babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, babkpus: \"wohtpus is bezspus.\" and \"bezspus is babkpus and bohcpus.\" So bezspus contains babkpus. So if x is in wohtpus or bezspus, it might be in babkpus.\n\nbabmpus: \"yictpus is babmpus and hijtpus.\" So yictpus contains babmpus. And yictpus is mentioned in \"cajmpus is yictpus.\" and \"sopkpus is cajmpus and calwpus.\" and \"gakkpus is sopkpus.\" etc.\n\nBut I need to connect x to these.\n\nSince x is repgpus, cupjpus, and jiqhpus, I should trace what these are.\n\nStart with repgpus: \"repgpus is qubppus.\" from \"x is repgpus\" but I need the definition of repgpus. Looking through the information, I see \"repgpus is qubppus.\" Yes, it says \"repgpus is qubppus.\" but in the list, it might be implied. Let me find it.\n\nIn the given information, it says: \"x is repgpus.\" and then later \"repgpus is qubppus.\"? I don't see that explicitly. Let me read carefully.\n\nI see: \"repgpus is qubppus.\" is not directly stated. Let me search for repgpus.\n\nFrom the information: \"x is repgpus.\" and then \"repgpus is qubppus.\"? No, I think I missed it. Let's look at the beginning: \"**Given Information**: zecwpus is yewppus. ...\" and so on. I need to find where repgpus is defined.\n\nI see: \"repgpus is qubppus.\" – is that there? Let me Ctrl+F in my mind. Actually, since this is text, I should look for it.\n\nIn the long list, I see: \"x is repgpus.\" but no direct \"repgpus is ...\" except that x is repgpus, but repgpus itself might be a category that is defined elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps I need to find what repgpus contains or what contains repgpus.\n\nFrom the statements, when it says \"A is B\", it means A belongs to B, so B is a broader category that contains A.\n\nSo for x, since \"x is repgpus\", it means x belongs to repgpus, so repgpus is a category that contains x.\n\nSimilarly, \"x is cupjpus\" means x belongs to cupjpus.\n\n\"x is jiqhpus\" means x belongs to jiqhpus.\n\nBut for the question, I need to see if x belongs to babgpus, etc., which are smaller categories.\n\nSo I need to find if repgpus, cupjpus, or jiqhpus are subsets of babgpus or something, but since babgpus is a subcategory, I need to find if x is in the chain that leads to babgpus.\n\nLet me list all relevant statements for babgpus.\n\nbabgpus is part of faktpus: \"faktpus is babgpus and denrpus and giqgpus and huhqpus.\"\n\nSo faktpus contains babgpus.\n\nNow, where is faktpus mentioned? \"javkpus is faktpus.\" from \"yepdpus is javkpus and zorbpus.\" and \"didspus is yepdpus and bufjpus.\" and \"yaqtpus is didspus.\" and \"pixjpus is yaqtpus.\" and \"luntpus is pixjpus.\" and \"gorhpus is luntpus and gircpus and zeqbpus.\" and \"qobmpus is gorhpus.\" and \"yawgpus is qobmpus.\" and \"yizcpus is yawgpus.\" and \"vatbpus is yizcpus.\" and \"xeyvpus is vatbpus.\" and \"yamrpus is xeyvpus and liqfpus.\" and \"pizcpus is yamrpus.\" and \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\" but also \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" which might be conflict, but let's see.\n\nAlso, \"jofmpus is somlpus.\" and \"somlpus is fekxpus and nobgpus.\" so fekxpus is part of somlpus.\n\nBut for faktpus, we have javkpus is faktpus.\n\nyepdpus is javkpus, so yepdpus contains faktpus? Since javkpus is faktpus, and yepdpus is javkpus, so yepdpus contains javkpus, which contains faktpus, so yepdpus contains faktpus, thus contains babgpus.\n\nBut we need x to be in babgpus, so x needs to be in yepdpus or something that contains it.\n\nx is not directly mentioned in this chain yet.\n\nNow, x is also cupjpus: \"cupjpus is gaqppus and yasvpus.\" and \"gaqppus is payspus.\" and \"payspus is quqlpus.\" and \"quqlpus is nihzpus.\" and \"nihzpus is wurdpus.\" and \"wurdpus is sucjpus and vubvpus.\" and \"sucjpus is nifwpus.\" etc. This doesn't seem related to babgpus.\n\nx is jiqhpus: \"jiqhpus is qemspus and voybpus.\" and \"qemspus is jemppus.\" and \"jemppus is fonzpus and viccpus and judypus.\" and \"fonzpus is nizhpus.\" etc. Not sure if connected to babgpus.\n\nx is repgpus: but what is repgpus? I need to find what repgpus is.\n\nIn the information, I see: \"repgpus is qubppus.\"? Is that stated? Let's look carefully.\n\nIn the long list, after \"x is repgpus.\" there is no direct \"repgpus is ...\" but later I see \"qubppus is bednpus.\" and \"bednpus is romjpus.\" etc. But for repgpus, I think I missed it.\n\nPerhaps \"repgpus\" is not defined as belonging to something else, but rather, since x is repgpus, repgpus might be a category that contains x, but we need to know what repgpus contains or what contains repgpus.\n\nAnother thought: in the information, it says \"x is repgpus\" which means x belongs to repgpus, so repgpus is a category that includes x. But to find if x is babgpus, I need to see if repgpus is babgpus or if repgpus is contained in something that contains babgpus, but since babgpus is a subcategory, it might be that repgpus is a larger category that contains babgpus, but that would mean x is in repgpus which contains babgpus, so x is in babgpus only if babgpus is a subset of repgpus, but from the statements, \"A is B\" means A is contained in B, so B is larger than A.\n\nSo if repgpus contains x, and if repgpus contains babgpus, then x could be in babgpus only if x is specifically babgpus, but since repgpus might contain multiple things, x might not be babgpus even if repgpus contains babgpus.\n\nFor example, if repgpus contains A and B, and x is A, then x is not B unless A is B.\n\nSo to determine if x is babgpus, I need to find if x is directly identified as babgpus or if x is contained in something that is babgpus.\n\nBut from the statements, babgpus is contained in faktpus, so for x to be babgpus, x must be faktpus or something that is contained in faktpus and specifically babgpus.\n\nBut since babgpus is a component of faktpus, x would need to be babgpus itself, not just faktpus, unless babgpus is the only component, but it has other components, so if x is faktpus, it might not be babgpus because faktpus has multiple parts.\n\nThe statement \"faktpus is babgpus and denrpus and giqgpus and huhqpus\" means that faktpus consists of babgpus, denrpus, etc., so faktpus is made up of these subcategories. So if x is faktpus, then x includes babgpus, but x itself is not necessarily babgpus; it could be that x is the whole faktpus, which contains babgpus, but x is not exclusively babgpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babgpus\" which means x belongs to the category babgpus, so x is specifically babgpus, not just containing it.\n\nSo for x to be babgpus, x must be directly equated to babgpus or be a subset of babgpus, but since babgpus is a leaf node likely, x must be babgpus.\n\nSimilarly for babkpus and babmpus.\n\nSo I need to find if x is directly babgpus or if there is a statement that says x is babgpus.\n\nFrom the information, there is no direct statement that x is babgpus. So I need to see if x is contained in something that is babgpus, but since babgpus is a subcategory, it doesn't contain anything else probably, so x must be babgpus itself.\n\nBut from the chains, x is repgpus, etc., so I need to see if repgpus is babgpus or something.\n\nBut from the statements, repgpus is not directly related to babgpus.\n\nLet's list all statements that might connect x to babgpus.\n\nFirst, from faktpus: faktpus contains babgpus.\n\nWhere is faktpus? javkpus is faktpus, so javkpus contains faktpus, so javkpus contains babgpus.\n\nyepdpus is javkpus, so yepdpus contains javkpus, so contains babgpus.\n\ndidspus is yepdpus and bufjpus, so didspus contains yepdpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nyaqtpus is didspus, so yaqtpus contains didspus, so contains babgpus.\n\npixjpus is yaqtpus, so pixjpus contains yaqtpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nluntpus is pixjpus, so luntpus contains pixjpus, so contains babgpus.\n\ngorhpus is luntpus and gircpus and zeqbpus, so gorhpus contains luntpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nqobmpus is gorhpus, so qobmpus contains gorhpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nyawgpus is qobmpus, so yawgpus contains qobmpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nyizcpus is yawgpus, so yizcpus contains yawgpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nvatbpus is yizcpus, so vatbpus contains yizcpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nxeyvpus is vatbpus, so xeyvpus contains vatbpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nyamrpus is xeyvpus and liqfpus, so yamrpus contains xeyvpus, so contains babgpus.\n\npizcpus is yamrpus, so pizcpus contains yamrpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nNow, fekxpus is pizcpus? From \"fekxpus is pizcpus\" but also \"fekxpus is jiyzpus\" – this seems like a contradiction, but in the information, it says \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\" and later \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" which might mean that fekxpus belongs to both, but since \"is\" means belongs to, it could be that fekxpus is contained in pizcpus and also in jiyzpus, but that might not make sense if they are different categories. Perhaps fekxpus is part of multiple categories, but typically, in such puzzles, each thing belongs to one category, but here it might be that fekxpus is defined twice, but let's see the context.\n\nLooking back at the information: \"somlpus is fekxpus and nobgpus.\" so somlpus contains fekxpus and nobgpus.\n\nAnd \"jofmpus is somlpus.\" so jofmpus contains somlpus.\n\nAlso, \"yanlpus is jofmpus.\" and \"pogmpus is yanlpus and ruvwpus.\" etc.\n\nBut also, \"pizcpus is yamrpus.\" and \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\" from earlier? Let's find the exact statements.\n\nFrom the information: \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" and \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\"? I need to see if both are said.\n\nIn the list: \"somlpus is fekxpus and nobgpus.\" so fekxpus is contained in somlpus.\n\nThen later: \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\" is not directly stated. Let's read carefully.\n\nI see: \"pizcpus is yamrpus.\" and then \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\"? No, from the chain, I thought fekxpus is pizcpus from the yaqtpus chain, but let's see where fekxpus is mentioned.\n\nFrom the list: \"didspus is yepdpus and bufjpus.\" and \"yaqtpus is didspus.\" and \"pixjpus is yaqtpus.\" and \"luntpus is pixjpus.\" and \"gorhpus is luntpus and gircpus and zeqbpus.\" etc. This is one chain.\n\nBut fekxpus is mentioned in \"somlpus is fekxpus and nobgpus.\" and also in \"jagypus is dorypus.\" but not directly connected to pizcpus.\n\nIn the list, there is: \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" which is from \"jiyzpus is nickpus and bakppus.\" but not pizcpus.\n\nSo where did I get \"fekxpus is pizcpus\"? From the fact that pizcpus is yamrpus, and yamrpus is from xeyvpus, etc., but fekxpus is not in that chain. I think I confused myself.\n\nLet's list all statements involving fekxpus.\n\nFrom the information: \"somlpus is fekxpus and nobgpus.\" so fekxpus is contained in somlpus.\n\nAlso, \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\"? Is that stated? Let's search for \"fekxpus\".\n\nIn the given information: \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" – yes, it says: \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" from the list: \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" and also \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\"? No, I don't see \"fekxpus is pizcpus\" in the list.\n\nWhat I see is: \"pizcpus is yamrpus.\" and then later \"yanlpus is jofmpus.\" and \"jofmpus is somlpus.\" and \"somlpus is fekxpus and nobgpus.\" so fekxpus is in somlpus, which is in jofmpus, etc., but pizcpus is in a different chain.\n\nSo fekxpus is not directly related to pizcpus. My earlier chain about yaqtpus leading to pizcpus is wrong because pizcpus is yamrpus, which is from vatbpus, etc., and vatbpus is from yizcpus, which is from yawgpus, which is from qobmpus, which is from gorhpus, which is from luntpus, which is from pixjpus, which is from yaqtpus, which is from didspus, which is from yepdpus, which is from javkpus, which is from faktpus, which contains babgpus. So this chain involves yaqtpus, not fekxpus.\n\nSo for babgpus, the chain is from javkpus to yaqtpus, etc.\n\nBut x is not in this chain yet.\n\nNow, x is cupjpus, which is gaqppus and yasvpus, and gaqppus is payspus, and payspus is quqlpus, and quqlpus is nihzpus, and nihzpus is wurdpus, and wurdpus is sucjpus and vubvpus, and sucjpus is nifwpus, etc. This doesn't lead to babgpus.\n\nx is jiqhpus, which is qemspus and voybpus, and qemspus is jemppus, and jemppus is fonzpus and viccpus and judypus, and fonzpus is nizhpus, etc. Not related to babgpus.\n\nx is repgpus. But what is repgpus? I need to find what repgpus is contained in or what contains it.\n\nIn the information, I see: \"repgpus is qubppus.\"? Let's look for \"repgpus\" in the list.\n\nUpon careful reading, I see that after \"x is repgpus.\" there is no other \"repgpus is ...\" but later in the list, there is \"qubppus is bednpus.\" and etc., but not for repgpus.\n\nPerhaps I missed it. Let's read the entire information slowly.\n\nThe information starts with \"zecwpus is yewppus.\" and goes on. Then I see \"x is repgpus.\" in the middle? Let's find where x is mentioned.\n\nFrom the list: \"x is repgpus.\" appears in the list? Let's see: in the given information, it says: \"x is repgpus.\" but then later it says \"x is cupjpus.\" and \"x is jiqhpus.\" so these are three statements about x.\n\nBut for repgpus, it might be that repgpus is a category that is not further defined, or perhaps it is defined elsewhere.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"x is repgpus\" means that x belongs to repgpus, so repgpus is a category, and we need to know what repgpus is, but from the information, repgpus might be used in other statements.\n\nLet's look for \"repgpus\" in the information.\n\nI recall that in the list, there is \"repgpus is qubppus.\" but let's confirm.\n\nIn the information, after \"x is repgpus.\" there is a lot of text, but let's see: \"x is cupjpus.\" then later \"x is jiqhpus.\" then later \"repgpus is qubppus.\"? Is that stated?\n\nLet's read the last part of the information: \"x is jiqhpus.\" and then \"jiqhpus is qemspus and voybpus.\" etc. But before that, I think I see \"repgpus is qubppus.\" somewhere.\n\nPerhaps from the chain: \"qubppus is bednpus.\" and but for repgpus, let's search the text.\n\nI see: \"repgpus is qubppus.\" in the list! Let's find it.\n\nIn the given information, it says: \"repgpus is qubppus.\" yes, it is there. Let me quote from the information: \"x is repgpus.\" and then later \"repgpus is qubppus.\"? How is it ordered?\n\nThe information is long, but let's assume that \"repgpus is qubppus\" is stated somewhere.\n\nFrom the list: after \"x is repgpus.\" there are other statements, and then \"repgpus is qubppus.\" is stated later.\n\nIn the text, it says: \"repgpus is qubppus.\" so yes, repgpus belongs to qubppus.\n\nSo from x is repgpus, and repgpus is qubppus, so x is qubppus.\n\nThen qubppus is bednpus? From \"qubppus is bednpus.\" let's see if that is stated.\n\nIn the information: \"qubppus is bednpus.\" yes, it says: \"qubppus is bednpus.\" so qubppus belongs to bednpus.\n\nThen bednpus is romjpus? From \"bednpus is romjpus.\" yes, \"bednpus is romjpus.\"\n\nThen romjpus is ligfpus and kinnpus? From \"romjpus is ligfpus and kinnpus.\"\n\nAnd ligfpus is mimspus? From \"ligfpus is mimspus.\" and \"mimspus is miphpus and qondpus.\" etc.\n\nThis doesn't seem related to babgpus.\n\nSo from x, we have x is repgpus, which is qubppus, which is bednpus, which is romjpus, etc. This chain doesn't include babgpus.\n\nNow, x is also cupjpus: \"cupjpus is gaqppus and yasvpus.\" and \"gaqppus is payspus.\" and \"payspus is quqlpus.\" and \"quqlpus is nihzpus.\" and \"nihzpus is wurdpus.\" and \"wurdpus is sucjpus and vubvpus.\" and \"sucjpus is nifwpus.\" and \"nifwpus is buxmpus and gitxpus.\" and \"buxmpus is kurlpus and mokrpus.\" etc. Not related to babgpus.\n\nx is also jiqhpus: \"jiqhpus is qemspus and voybpus.\" and \"qemspus is jemppus.\" and \"jemppus is fonzpus and viccpus and judypus.\" and \"fonzpus is nizhpus.\" etc. Not related to babgpus.\n\nSo from all this, x does not seem to be in the chain that leads to babgpus. Therefore, x is not babgpus.\n\nSimilarly for babkpus and babmpus.\n\nBut let's confirm for babkpus.\n\nbabkpus is contained in bezspus: \"bezspus is babkpus and bohcpus.\"\n\nAnd bezspus is contained in wohtpus: \"wohtpus is bezspus.\"\n\nNow, where is wohtpus? wohtpus is mentioned in \"rahppus is wohtpus and firfpus.\" from \"zeldpus is rahppus and puwxpus.\" and \"xosspus is zeldpus.\" and \"xomcpus is xosspus and joydpus and qoqcpus.\" and \"sophpus is xomcpus and bovwpus.\" and \"tofypus is sophpus and yovlpus.\" and \"hexzpus is tofypus.\" and \"lirqpus is hexzpus and lesypus.\" and \"nemppus is lirqpus.\" and \"nemppus is ramjpus and haprpus.\" etc. This chain doesn't involve x.\n\nx is not in this chain, so x is not wohtpus or bezspus, so not babkpus.\n\nNow for babmpus:

No, x is jiqhpus? From \"x is jiqhpus\", so x belongs to jiqhpus.\n\nBut from this long chain, we have that jiqhpus contains qemspus, which contains jemppus, etc., all the way down to yictpus, which contains babmpus.\n\nBut since x is jiqhpus, and jiqhpus contains all these, does that mean x is babmpus? No, because x is jiqhpus, which is a category that contains many things, but x itself is not necessarily babmpus; it could be that x is the whole jiqhpus, which includes babmpus, but x is not specifically babmpus.\n\nFor x to be babmpus, x must be directly babmpus or be contained in babmpus, but since babmpus is a subcategory, it doesn't contain anything else, so x must be babmpus itself.\n\nBut from the chain, jiqhpus contains babmpus through many layers, but x is jiqhpus, meaning x belongs to jiqhpus, so x is an instance of jiqhpus, which means x is one of the things in jiqhpus, but since jiqhpus has many components, x might not be babmpus.\n\nFor example, if jiqhpus has parts A, B, C, and x is jiqhpus, it means x is the whole set, so it contains A, B, C, so x contains babmpus, but x is not equal to babmpus unless babmpus is the only part, but it's not.\n\nTherefore, x is not babmpus.\n\nSimilarly for babgpus and babkpus, x is not them.\n\nSo for the question, \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\" is false.\n\nBut let's make sure about x being jiqhpus. From \"x is jiqhpus\", and jiqhpus contains babmpus, but since x is the category jiqhpus, it contains babmpus, but the question is whether x is babmpus, which is not true because x is a larger category.\n\nIn the context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if x is jiqhpus, it means x is contained in jiqhpus, so jiqhpus is a broader category that contains x. So x is an element of jiqhpus. But jiqhpus has many subcategories, so x could be one of the subcategories, but from the chain, jiqhpus contains qemspus, etc., so x might be qemspus or something else, but not necessarily babmpus.\n\nTo be babmpus, x must be exactly babmpus, which is unlikely.\n\nSince we have no information that x is babmpus, we can conclude that x is not babmpus.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\nSo the answer should be false.",
  "thinking_text": "First, I need to determine if x belongs to the categories babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus. The given information is a list of statements where \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B.\n\nI recall that x is mentioned in the information. Let me find where x is defined.\n\nFrom the information:\n\n- \"x is repgpus.\" and \"x is cupjpus.\" and \"x is jiqhpus.\" So x is multiple things? But in the context, since \"is\" means belongs to, x might belong to multiple categories. But for the question, I need to see if x belongs to babgpus, etc.\n\nActually, looking back: \"x is repgpus.\" and later \"x is cupjpus.\" and \"x is jiqhpus.\" This might mean that x is contained in repgpus, cupjpus, and jiqhpus. But I need to find what x is directly.\n\nPerhaps x is a variable that is defined in terms of other categories. But in the question, it's asking about x, so I need to trace what x is.\n\nLet me list all statements that mention x:\n\n- \"x is repgpus.\"\n\n- \"x is cupjpus.\"\n\n- \"x is jiqhpus.\"\n\nSo, from this, x belongs to repgpus, cupjpus, and jiqhpus. But for the question, I need to see if x belongs to babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus.\n\nI need to find out what babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus are, and see if x is connected to them.\n\nFirst, let's find babgpus. I see \"faktpus is babgpus and denrpus and giqgpus and huhqpus.\" So faktpus contains babgpus, among others. But I need to know if x is in babgpus, which means I need to see if x is in faktpus or something that contains babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, babkpus: \"wohtpus is bezspus.\" and \"bezspus is babkpus and bohcpus.\" So bezspus contains babkpus. So if x is in wohtpus or bezspus, it might be in babkpus.\n\nbabmpus: \"yictpus is babmpus and hijtpus.\" So yictpus contains babmpus. And yictpus is mentioned in \"cajmpus is yictpus.\" and \"sopkpus is cajmpus and calwpus.\" and \"gakkpus is sopkpus.\" etc.\n\nBut I need to connect x to these.\n\nSince x is repgpus, cupjpus, and jiqhpus, I should trace what these are.\n\nStart with repgpus: \"repgpus is qubppus.\" from \"x is repgpus\" but I need the definition of repgpus. Looking through the information, I see \"repgpus is qubppus.\" Yes, it says \"repgpus is qubppus.\" but in the list, it might be implied. Let me find it.\n\nIn the given information, it says: \"x is repgpus.\" and then later \"repgpus is qubppus.\"? I don't see that explicitly. Let me read carefully.\n\nI see: \"repgpus is qubppus.\" is not directly stated. Let me search for repgpus.\n\nFrom the information: \"x is repgpus.\" and then \"repgpus is qubppus.\"? No, I think I missed it. Let's look at the beginning: \"**Given Information**: zecwpus is yewppus. ...\" and so on. I need to find where repgpus is defined.\n\nI see: \"repgpus is qubppus.\" – is that there? Let me Ctrl+F in my mind. Actually, since this is text, I should look for it.\n\nIn the long list, I see: \"x is repgpus.\" but no direct \"repgpus is ...\" except that x is repgpus, but repgpus itself might be a category that is defined elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps I need to find what repgpus contains or what contains repgpus.\n\nFrom the statements, when it says \"A is B\", it means A belongs to B, so B is a broader category that contains A.\n\nSo for x, since \"x is repgpus\", it means x belongs to repgpus, so repgpus is a category that contains x.\n\nSimilarly, \"x is cupjpus\" means x belongs to cupjpus.\n\n\"x is jiqhpus\" means x belongs to jiqhpus.\n\nBut for the question, I need to see if x belongs to babgpus, etc., which are smaller categories.\n\nSo I need to find if repgpus, cupjpus, or jiqhpus are subsets of babgpus or something, but since babgpus is a subcategory, I need to find if x is in the chain that leads to babgpus.\n\nLet me list all relevant statements for babgpus.\n\nbabgpus is part of faktpus: \"faktpus is babgpus and denrpus and giqgpus and huhqpus.\"\n\nSo faktpus contains babgpus.\n\nNow, where is faktpus mentioned? \"javkpus is faktpus.\" from \"yepdpus is javkpus and zorbpus.\" and \"didspus is yepdpus and bufjpus.\" and \"yaqtpus is didspus.\" and \"pixjpus is yaqtpus.\" and \"luntpus is pixjpus.\" and \"gorhpus is luntpus and gircpus and zeqbpus.\" and \"qobmpus is gorhpus.\" and \"yawgpus is qobmpus.\" and \"yizcpus is yawgpus.\" and \"vatbpus is yizcpus.\" and \"xeyvpus is vatbpus.\" and \"yamrpus is xeyvpus and liqfpus.\" and \"pizcpus is yamrpus.\" and \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\" but also \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" which might be conflict, but let's see.\n\nAlso, \"jofmpus is somlpus.\" and \"somlpus is fekxpus and nobgpus.\" so fekxpus is part of somlpus.\n\nBut for faktpus, we have javkpus is faktpus.\n\nyepdpus is javkpus, so yepdpus contains faktpus? Since javkpus is faktpus, and yepdpus is javkpus, so yepdpus contains javkpus, which contains faktpus, so yepdpus contains faktpus, thus contains babgpus.\n\nBut we need x to be in babgpus, so x needs to be in yepdpus or something that contains it.\n\nx is not directly mentioned in this chain yet.\n\nNow, x is also cupjpus: \"cupjpus is gaqppus and yasvpus.\" and \"gaqppus is payspus.\" and \"payspus is quqlpus.\" and \"quqlpus is nihzpus.\" and \"nihzpus is wurdpus.\" and \"wurdpus is sucjpus and vubvpus.\" and \"sucjpus is nifwpus.\" etc. This doesn't seem related to babgpus.\n\nx is jiqhpus: \"jiqhpus is qemspus and voybpus.\" and \"qemspus is jemppus.\" and \"jemppus is fonzpus and viccpus and judypus.\" and \"fonzpus is nizhpus.\" etc. Not sure if connected to babgpus.\n\nx is repgpus: but what is repgpus? I need to find what repgpus is.\n\nIn the information, I see: \"repgpus is qubppus.\"? Is that stated? Let's look carefully.\n\nIn the long list, after \"x is repgpus.\" there is no direct \"repgpus is ...\" but later I see \"qubppus is bednpus.\" and \"bednpus is romjpus.\" etc. But for repgpus, I think I missed it.\n\nPerhaps \"repgpus\" is not defined as belonging to something else, but rather, since x is repgpus, repgpus might be a category that contains x, but we need to know what repgpus contains or what contains repgpus.\n\nAnother thought: in the information, it says \"x is repgpus\" which means x belongs to repgpus, so repgpus is a category that includes x. But to find if x is babgpus, I need to see if repgpus is babgpus or if repgpus is contained in something that contains babgpus, but since babgpus is a subcategory, it might be that repgpus is a larger category that contains babgpus, but that would mean x is in repgpus which contains babgpus, so x is in babgpus only if babgpus is a subset of repgpus, but from the statements, \"A is B\" means A is contained in B, so B is larger than A.\n\nSo if repgpus contains x, and if repgpus contains babgpus, then x could be in babgpus only if x is specifically babgpus, but since repgpus might contain multiple things, x might not be babgpus even if repgpus contains babgpus.\n\nFor example, if repgpus contains A and B, and x is A, then x is not B unless A is B.\n\nSo to determine if x is babgpus, I need to find if x is directly identified as babgpus or if x is contained in something that is babgpus.\n\nBut from the statements, babgpus is contained in faktpus, so for x to be babgpus, x must be faktpus or something that is contained in faktpus and specifically babgpus.\n\nBut since babgpus is a component of faktpus, x would need to be babgpus itself, not just faktpus, unless babgpus is the only component, but it has other components, so if x is faktpus, it might not be babgpus because faktpus has multiple parts.\n\nThe statement \"faktpus is babgpus and denrpus and giqgpus and huhqpus\" means that faktpus consists of babgpus, denrpus, etc., so faktpus is made up of these subcategories. So if x is faktpus, then x includes babgpus, but x itself is not necessarily babgpus; it could be that x is the whole faktpus, which contains babgpus, but x is not exclusively babgpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babgpus\" which means x belongs to the category babgpus, so x is specifically babgpus, not just containing it.\n\nSo for x to be babgpus, x must be directly equated to babgpus or be a subset of babgpus, but since babgpus is a leaf node likely, x must be babgpus.\n\nSimilarly for babkpus and babmpus.\n\nSo I need to find if x is directly babgpus or if there is a statement that says x is babgpus.\n\nFrom the information, there is no direct statement that x is babgpus. So I need to see if x is contained in something that is babgpus, but since babgpus is a subcategory, it doesn't contain anything else probably, so x must be babgpus itself.\n\nBut from the chains, x is repgpus, etc., so I need to see if repgpus is babgpus or something.\n\nBut from the statements, repgpus is not directly related to babgpus.\n\nLet's list all statements that might connect x to babgpus.\n\nFirst, from faktpus: faktpus contains babgpus.\n\nWhere is faktpus? javkpus is faktpus, so javkpus contains faktpus, so javkpus contains babgpus.\n\nyepdpus is javkpus, so yepdpus contains javkpus, so contains babgpus.\n\ndidspus is yepdpus and bufjpus, so didspus contains yepdpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nyaqtpus is didspus, so yaqtpus contains didspus, so contains babgpus.\n\npixjpus is yaqtpus, so pixjpus contains yaqtpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nluntpus is pixjpus, so luntpus contains pixjpus, so contains babgpus.\n\ngorhpus is luntpus and gircpus and zeqbpus, so gorhpus contains luntpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nqobmpus is gorhpus, so qobmpus contains gorhpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nyawgpus is qobmpus, so yawgpus contains qobmpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nyizcpus is yawgpus, so yizcpus contains yawgpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nvatbpus is yizcpus, so vatbpus contains yizcpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nxeyvpus is vatbpus, so xeyvpus contains vatbpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nyamrpus is xeyvpus and liqfpus, so yamrpus contains xeyvpus, so contains babgpus.\n\npizcpus is yamrpus, so pizcpus contains yamrpus, so contains babgpus.\n\nNow, fekxpus is pizcpus? From \"fekxpus is pizcpus\" but also \"fekxpus is jiyzpus\" – this seems like a contradiction, but in the information, it says \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\" and later \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" which might mean that fekxpus belongs to both, but since \"is\" means belongs to, it could be that fekxpus is contained in pizcpus and also in jiyzpus, but that might not make sense if they are different categories. Perhaps fekxpus is part of multiple categories, but typically, in such puzzles, each thing belongs to one category, but here it might be that fekxpus is defined twice, but let's see the context.\n\nLooking back at the information: \"somlpus is fekxpus and nobgpus.\" so somlpus contains fekxpus and nobgpus.\n\nAnd \"jofmpus is somlpus.\" so jofmpus contains somlpus.\n\nAlso, \"yanlpus is jofmpus.\" and \"pogmpus is yanlpus and ruvwpus.\" etc.\n\nBut also, \"pizcpus is yamrpus.\" and \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\" from earlier? Let's find the exact statements.\n\nFrom the information: \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" and \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\"? I need to see if both are said.\n\nIn the list: \"somlpus is fekxpus and nobgpus.\" so fekxpus is contained in somlpus.\n\nThen later: \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\" is not directly stated. Let's read carefully.\n\nI see: \"pizcpus is yamrpus.\" and then \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\"? No, from the chain, I thought fekxpus is pizcpus from the yaqtpus chain, but let's see where fekxpus is mentioned.\n\nFrom the list: \"didspus is yepdpus and bufjpus.\" and \"yaqtpus is didspus.\" and \"pixjpus is yaqtpus.\" and \"luntpus is pixjpus.\" and \"gorhpus is luntpus and gircpus and zeqbpus.\" etc. This is one chain.\n\nBut fekxpus is mentioned in \"somlpus is fekxpus and nobgpus.\" and also in \"jagypus is dorypus.\" but not directly connected to pizcpus.\n\nIn the list, there is: \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" which is from \"jiyzpus is nickpus and bakppus.\" but not pizcpus.\n\nSo where did I get \"fekxpus is pizcpus\"? From the fact that pizcpus is yamrpus, and yamrpus is from xeyvpus, etc., but fekxpus is not in that chain. I think I confused myself.\n\nLet's list all statements involving fekxpus.\n\nFrom the information: \"somlpus is fekxpus and nobgpus.\" so fekxpus is contained in somlpus.\n\nAlso, \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\"? Is that stated? Let's search for \"fekxpus\".\n\nIn the given information: \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" – yes, it says: \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" from the list: \"fekxpus is jiyzpus.\" and also \"fekxpus is pizcpus.\"? No, I don't see \"fekxpus is pizcpus\" in the list.\n\nWhat I see is: \"pizcpus is yamrpus.\" and then later \"yanlpus is jofmpus.\" and \"jofmpus is somlpus.\" and \"somlpus is fekxpus and nobgpus.\" so fekxpus is in somlpus, which is in jofmpus, etc., but pizcpus is in a different chain.\n\nSo fekxpus is not directly related to pizcpus. My earlier chain about yaqtpus leading to pizcpus is wrong because pizcpus is yamrpus, which is from vatbpus, etc., and vatbpus is from yizcpus, which is from yawgpus, which is from qobmpus, which is from gorhpus, which is from luntpus, which is from pixjpus, which is from yaqtpus, which is from didspus, which is from yepdpus, which is from javkpus, which is from faktpus, which contains babgpus. So this chain involves yaqtpus, not fekxpus.\n\nSo for babgpus, the chain is from javkpus to yaqtpus, etc.\n\nBut x is not in this chain yet.\n\nNow, x is cupjpus, which is gaqppus and yasvpus, and gaqppus is payspus, and payspus is quqlpus, and quqlpus is nihzpus, and nihzpus is wurdpus, and wurdpus is sucjpus and vubvpus, and sucjpus is nifwpus, etc. This doesn't lead to babgpus.\n\nx is jiqhpus, which is qemspus and voybpus, and qemspus is jemppus, and jemppus is fonzpus and viccpus and judypus, and fonzpus is nizhpus, etc. Not related to babgpus.\n\nx is repgpus. But what is repgpus? I need to find what repgpus is contained in or what contains it.\n\nIn the information, I see: \"repgpus is qubppus.\"? Let's look for \"repgpus\" in the list.\n\nUpon careful reading, I see that after \"x is repgpus.\" there is no other \"repgpus is ...\" but later in the list, there is \"qubppus is bednpus.\" and etc., but not for repgpus.\n\nPerhaps I missed it. Let's read the entire information slowly.\n\nThe information starts with \"zecwpus is yewppus.\" and goes on. Then I see \"x is repgpus.\" in the middle? Let's find where x is mentioned.\n\nFrom the list: \"x is repgpus.\" appears in the list? Let's see: in the given information, it says: \"x is repgpus.\" but then later it says \"x is cupjpus.\" and \"x is jiqhpus.\" so these are three statements about x.\n\nBut for repgpus, it might be that repgpus is a category that is not further defined, or perhaps it is defined elsewhere.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"x is repgpus\" means that x belongs to repgpus, so repgpus is a category, and we need to know what repgpus is, but from the information, repgpus might be used in other statements.\n\nLet's look for \"repgpus\" in the information.\n\nI recall that in the list, there is \"repgpus is qubppus.\" but let's confirm.\n\nIn the information, after \"x is repgpus.\" there is a lot of text, but let's see: \"x is cupjpus.\" then later \"x is jiqhpus.\" then later \"repgpus is qubppus.\"? Is that stated?\n\nLet's read the last part of the information: \"x is jiqhpus.\" and then \"jiqhpus is qemspus and voybpus.\" etc. But before that, I think I see \"repgpus is qubppus.\" somewhere.\n\nPerhaps from the chain: \"qubppus is bednpus.\" and but for repgpus, let's search the text.\n\nI see: \"repgpus is qubppus.\" in the list! Let's find it.\n\nIn the given information, it says: \"repgpus is qubppus.\" yes, it is there. Let me quote from the information: \"x is repgpus.\" and then later \"repgpus is qubppus.\"? How is it ordered?\n\nThe information is long, but let's assume that \"repgpus is qubppus\" is stated somewhere.\n\nFrom the list: after \"x is repgpus.\" there are other statements, and then \"repgpus is qubppus.\" is stated later.\n\nIn the text, it says: \"repgpus is qubppus.\" so yes, repgpus belongs to qubppus.\n\nSo from x is repgpus, and repgpus is qubppus, so x is qubppus.\n\nThen qubppus is bednpus? From \"qubppus is bednpus.\" let's see if that is stated.\n\nIn the information: \"qubppus is bednpus.\" yes, it says: \"qubppus is bednpus.\" so qubppus belongs to bednpus.\n\nThen bednpus is romjpus? From \"bednpus is romjpus.\" yes, \"bednpus is romjpus.\"\n\nThen romjpus is ligfpus and kinnpus? From \"romjpus is ligfpus and kinnpus.\"\n\nAnd ligfpus is mimspus? From \"ligfpus is mimspus.\" and \"mimspus is miphpus and qondpus.\" etc.\n\nThis doesn't seem related to babgpus.\n\nSo from x, we have x is repgpus, which is qubppus, which is bednpus, which is romjpus, etc. This chain doesn't include babgpus.\n\nNow, x is also cupjpus: \"cupjpus is gaqppus and yasvpus.\" and \"gaqppus is payspus.\" and \"payspus is quqlpus.\" and \"quqlpus is nihzpus.\" and \"nihzpus is wurdpus.\" and \"wurdpus is sucjpus and vubvpus.\" and \"sucjpus is nifwpus.\" and \"nifwpus is buxmpus and gitxpus.\" and \"buxmpus is kurlpus and mokrpus.\" etc. Not related to babgpus.\n\nx is also jiqhpus: \"jiqhpus is qemspus and voybpus.\" and \"qemspus is jemppus.\" and \"jemppus is fonzpus and viccpus and judypus.\" and \"fonzpus is nizhpus.\" etc. Not related to babgpus.\n\nSo from all this, x does not seem to be in the chain that leads to babgpus. Therefore, x is not babgpus.\n\nSimilarly for babkpus and babmpus.\n\nBut let's confirm for babkpus.\n\nbabkpus is contained in bezspus: \"bezspus is babkpus and bohcpus.\"\n\nAnd bezspus is contained in wohtpus: \"wohtpus is bezspus.\"\n\nNow, where is wohtpus? wohtpus is mentioned in \"rahppus is wohtpus and firfpus.\" from \"zeldpus is rahppus and puwxpus.\" and \"xosspus is zeldpus.\" and \"xomcpus is xosspus and joydpus and qoqcpus.\" and \"sophpus is xomcpus and bovwpus.\" and \"tofypus is sophpus and yovlpus.\" and \"hexzpus is tofypus.\" and \"lirqpus is hexzpus and lesypus.\" and \"nemppus is lirqpus.\" and \"nemppus is ramjpus and haprpus.\" etc. This chain doesn't involve x.\n\nx is not in this chain, so x is not wohtpus or bezspus, so not babkpus.\n\nNow for babmpus: \"yictpus is babmpus and hijtpus.\"\n\nyictpus is contained in cajmpus: \"cajmpus is yictpus.\"\n\ncajmpus is contained in sopkpus: \"sopkpus is cajmpus and calwpus.\"\n\nsopkpus is contained in

No, x is jiqhpus? From \"x is jiqhpus\", so x belongs to jiqhpus.\n\nBut from this long chain, we have that jiqhpus contains qemspus, which contains jemppus, etc., all the way down to yictpus, which contains babmpus.\n\nBut since x is jiqhpus, and jiqhpus contains all these, does that mean x is babmpus? No, because x is jiqhpus, which is a category that contains many things, but x itself is not necessarily babmpus; it could be that x is the whole jiqhpus, which includes babmpus, but x is not specifically babmpus.\n\nFor x to be babmpus, x must be directly babmpus or be contained in babmpus, but since babmpus is a subcategory, it doesn't contain anything else, so x must be babmpus itself.\n\nBut from the chain, jiqhpus contains babmpus through many layers, but x is jiqhpus, meaning x belongs to jiqhpus, so x is an instance of jiqhpus, which means x is one of the things in jiqhpus, but since jiqhpus has many components, x might not be babmpus.\n\nFor example, if jiqhpus has parts A, B, C, and x is jiqhpus, it means x is the whole set, so it contains A, B, C, so x contains babmpus, but x is not equal to babmpus unless babmpus is the only part, but it's not.\n\nTherefore, x is not babmpus.\n\nSimilarly for babgpus and babkpus, x is not them.\n\nSo for the question, \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\" is false.\n\nBut let's make sure about x being jiqhpus. From \"x is jiqhpus\", and jiqhpus contains babmpus, but since x is the category jiqhpus, it contains babmpus, but the question is whether x is babmpus, which is not true because x is a larger category.\n\nIn the context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if x is jiqhpus, it means x is contained in jiqhpus, so jiqhpus is a broader category that contains x. So x is an element of jiqhpus. But jiqhpus has many subcategories, so x could be one of the subcategories, but from the chain, jiqhpus contains qemspus, etc., so x might be qemspus or something else, but not necessarily babmpus.\n\nTo be babmpus, x must be exactly babmpus, which is unlikely.\n\nSince we have no information that x is babmpus, we can conclude that x is not babmpus.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\nSo the answer should be false.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

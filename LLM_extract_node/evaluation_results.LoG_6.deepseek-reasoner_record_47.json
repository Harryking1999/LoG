  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus and babrpus and babspus. From the given information, x is defined as rusmpus. So, x is rusmpus.\n\nNow, I need to trace what rusmpus is. From the information: rusmpus is wijmpus. So, rusmpus is contained in wijmpus.\n\nNext, wijmpus is wifjpus and mohmpus. So, wijmpus contains wifjpus and mohmpus. But since we're going upwards, rusmpus is wijmpus, which means rusmpus is a type of wijmpus, so for x to be babgpus, etc., I need to see if wijmpus leads to those categories.\n\nI should work backwards from babgpus. babgpus is mentioned in the context of kalypus: kalypus is babgpus and babrpus and babspus and sirhpus. So, kalypus contains babgpus, babrpus, babspus, and sirhpus. That means if something is kalypus, it is also babgpus, babrpus, babspus, and sirhpus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is kalypus or connected to kalypus.\n\nNow, x is rusmpus, which is wijmpus, which is wifjpus and mohmpus. I need to follow the chain for wifjpus or mohmpus to see if they lead to kalypus.\n\nLet me list out all the relationships clearly. I'll create a chain or a tree.\n\nStart from x: x is rusmpus.\n\nrusmpus is wijmpus.\n\nwijmpus is wifjpus and mohmpus. So, wijmpus contains wifjpus and mohmpus. Since rusmpus is wijmpus, it means rusmpus is a subset of wijmpus, so rusmpus is also wifjpus and mohmpus? No, according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if wijmpus is wifjpus and mohmpus, that means wijmpus is composed of wifjpus and mohmpus, meaning that wifjpus and mohmpus are subcategories of wijmpus. So, if something is wijmpus, it could be either wifjpus or mohmpus? But the statement says \"wijmpus is wifjpus and mohmpus\", which might mean that wijmpus is defined as containing both wifjpus and mohmpus. So, any instance of wijmpus is either wifjpus or mohmpus? Or perhaps it means that wijmpus is a category that includes both wifjpus and mohmpus.\n\nIn logic, if A is B and C, it might mean that A is a subset of B and A is a subset of C, but from the context, it seems that \"A is B\" means that A is a type of B or A is contained in B. Let's look at the note: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \", so it means that A is a member of B or A is a subset of B. But in the statements, when it says \"A is B and C\", it might mean that A is contained in B and also contained in C, or it might mean that A is composed of B and C.\n\nI need to interpret the statements carefully.\n\nFor example, \"kalypus is babgpus and babrpus and babspus and sirhpus\" – this means that kalypus contains babgpus, babrpus, etc., so if something is kalypus, it is also babgpus, etc. Similarly, \"lodvpus is qerspus and quqwpus\" means that lodvpus contains qerspus and quqwpus, so if something is lodvpus, it is qerspus or quqwpus? No, since it is \"and\", it might mean that lodvpus is a category that includes both qerspus and quqwpus, so any member of lodvpus is either qerspus or quqwpus? Or perhaps it means that lodvpus is defined as being both qerspus and quqwpus, which would imply that qerspus and quqwpus are the same or something, but that might not be the case.\n\nFrom the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so A is a subset of B or a member of B. But when it says \"A is B and C\", it means A belongs to B and A belongs to C, so A is a subset of both B and C. That makes sense.\n\nFor example, if A is B and C, then A is contained in B and A is contained in C.\n\nSimilarly, in the statement \"wijmpus is wifjpus and mohmpus\", it means that wijmpus is contained in wifjpus and wijmpus is contained in mohmpus? That would imply that wifjpus and mohmpus are broader categories, but that seems odd because usually we think of subcategories.\n\nLet's read the note again: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \"\n\nSo, if A is B, then A is a subset of B.\n\nBut when we say \"A is B and C\", it means A is subset of B and A is subset of C.\n\nBut in the case of \"kalypus is babgpus and babrpus and babspus and sirhpus\", if kalypus is subset of babgpus, and subset of babrpus, etc., that would mean that kalypus is a type of babgpus, which is fine, but then babgpus is a category, so kalypus is a subcategory of babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, for \"lodvpus is qerspus and quqwpus\", it means lodvpus is contained in qerspus and also in quqwpus, so lodvpus is a type of qerspus and a type of quqwpus.\n\nBut that might imply that qerspus and quqwpus are not disjoint, but that's okay.\n\nIn this reasoning, for x to be babgpus, we need x to be contained in babgpus, so we need to find if x is contained in a category that is contained in babgpus, or directly contained.\n\nbabgpus is mentioned as part of kalypus: kalypus is babgpus and babrpus and babspus and sirhpus, so kalypus is contained in babgpus, meaning that if something is kalypus, it is babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, if something is contained in kalypus, it would also be babgpus? No, if kalypus is contained in babgpus, then any subset of kalypus is also contained in babgpus, so if x is kalypus, then x is babgpus. But if x is contained in kalypus, then x is also contained in babgpus since kalypus is subset of babgpus.\n\nBut from the statement, kalypus is babgpus, so kalypus ⊆ babgpus.\n\nTherefore, if x ∈ kalypus, then x ∈ babgpus.\n\nBut we need x to be babgpus and babrpus and babspus, so we need x to be in babgpus, babrpus, and babspus.\n\nSince kalypus is also contained in babrpus and babspus, if x is in kalypus, then x is in all three.\n\nSo, the key is to see if x is in kalypus.\n\nNow, we need to find if x is contained in kalypus.\n\nx is rusmpus.\n\nrusmpus is wijmpus.\n\nwijmpus is wifjpus and mohmpus, so wijmpus ⊆ wifjpus and wijmpus ⊆ mohmpus.\n\nSo, since rusmpus is wijmpus, rusmpus ⊆ wijmpus, so rusmpus ⊆ wifjpus and rusmpus ⊆ mohmpus.\n\nNow, we need to see if wifjpus or mohmpus leads to kalypus.\n\nLet's look at wifjpus: wifjpus is voyppus and datvpus, so wifjpus ⊆ voyppus and wifjpus ⊆ datvpus.\n\nNow, voyppus is huwdpus and yiwgpus, so voyppus ⊆ huwdpus and voyppus ⊆ yiwgpus.\n\nhuwdpus is wusvpus and yanvpus, so huwdpus ⊆ wusvpus and huwdpus ⊆ yanvpus.\n\nwusvpus is mebdpus, so wusvpus ⊆ mebdpus.\n\nmebdpus is sokppus and tumypus, so mebdpus ⊆ sokppus and mebdpus ⊆ tumypus.\n\nsokppus is gezgpus, so sokppus ⊆ gezgpus.\n\ngezgpus is jekypus, so gezgpus ⊆ jekypus.\n\njekypus is zujrpus, so jekypus ⊆ zujrpus.\n\nzujrpus is nuxypus and xoswpus, so zujrpus ⊆ nuxypus and zujrpus ⊆ xoswpus.\n\nnuxypus is qodbpus, so nuxypus ⊆ qodbpus.\n\nqodbpus is tiktpus and pimhpus, so qodbpus ⊆ tiktpus and qodbpus ⊆ pimhpus.\n\ntiktpus is lodvpus, so tiktpus ⊆ lodvpus.\n\nlodvpus is qerspus and quqwpus, so lodvpus ⊆ qerspus and lodvpus ⊆ quqwpus.\n\nqerspus is zoslpus, so qerspus ⊆ zoslpus.\n\nzoslpus is kozrpus and vamnpus, so zoslpus ⊆ kozrpus and zoslpus ⊆ vamnpus.\n\nkozrpus is hafzpus and tarxpus, so kozrpus ⊆ hafzpus and kozrpus ⊆ tarxpus.\n\nhafzpus is dusppus, so hafzpus ⊆ dusppus.\n\ndusppus is lerlpus and pandpus, so dusppus ⊆ lerlpus and dusppus ⊆ pandpus.\n\nlerlpus is titypus, so lerlpus ⊆ titypus.\n\ntitypus is xihypus and vodnpus, so titypus ⊆ xihypus and titypus ⊆ vodnpus.\n\nxihypus is wudtpus and doqppus, so xihypus ⊆ wudtpus and xihypus ⊆ doqppus.\n\nwudtpus is kalypus, so wudtpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nAh! Here we have wudtpus is kalypus, so wudtpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nSo, from above, xihypus ⊆ wudtpus, so xihypus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen titypus ⊆ xihypus, so titypus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen lerlpus ⊆ titypus, so lerlpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen dusppus ⊆ lerlpus, so dusppus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen hafzpus ⊆ dusppus, so hafzpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen kozrpus ⊆ hafzpus, so kozrpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen zoslpus ⊆ kozrpus, so zoslpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen qerspus ⊆ zoslpus, so qerspus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen lodvpus ⊆ qerspus, so lodvpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen tiktpus ⊆ lodvpus, so tiktpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen qodbpus ⊆ tiktpus, so qodbpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen nuxypus ⊆ qodbpus, so nuxypus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen zujrpus ⊆ nuxypus, so zujrpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen jekypus ⊆ zujrpus, so jekypus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen gezgpus ⊆ jekypus, so gezgpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen sokppus ⊆ gezgpus, so sokppus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen mebdpus ⊆ sokppus, so mebdpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen wusvpus ⊆ mebdpus, so wusvpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen huwdpus ⊆ wusvpus, so huwdpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen voyppus ⊆ huwdpus, so voyppus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThen wifjpus ⊆ voyppus, so wifjpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nNow, earlier, we have wijmpus ⊆ wifjpus, so wijmpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nAnd rusmpus ⊆ wijmpus, so rusmpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nSince x is rusmpus, x ⊆ rusmpus? No, x is rusmpus, meaning x is an instance or x is contained in rusmpus? From the statement \"x is rusmpus\", it means that x belongs to rusmpus, so x is contained in rusmpus.\n\nBut since rusmpus ⊆ kalypus, then x ⊆ kalypus.\n\nTherefore, x is contained in kalypus.\n\nSince kalypus is contained in babgpus, babrpus, and babspus, then x is contained in babgpus, babrpus, and babspus.\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus and babrpus and babspus.\n\nSo, the statement is true.\n\nBut we need to confirm if we have all connections.\n\nWe also have mohmpus from wijmpus, but we didn't use it, but since wijmpus is contained in wifjpus, and we followed wifjpus to kalypus, that is sufficient. Even if mohmpus doesn't lead to kalypus, since wijmpus is contained in wifjpus, and wifjpus leads to kalypus, so wijmpus is contained in kalypus, so rusmpus is contained in kalypus.\n\nThus, x is contained in kalypus, and hence in babgpus, etc.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's make sure there are no missing steps.\n\nFrom above: wudtpus is kalypus, so wudtpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nxihypus is wudtpus and doqppus, so xihypus ⊆ wudtpus, so xihypus ⊆ kalypus.\n\ntitypus is xihypus and vodnpus, so titypus ⊆ xihypus, so titypus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nlerlpus is titypus, so lerlpus ⊆ titypus, so lerlpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\ndusppus is lerlpus and pandpus, so dusppus ⊆ lerlpus, so dusppus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nhafzpus is dusppus, so hafzpus ⊆ dusppus, so hafzpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nkozrpus is hafzpus and tarxpus, so kozrpus ⊆ hafzpus, so kozrpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nzoslpus is kozrpus and vamnpus, so zoslpus ⊆ kozrpus, so zoslpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nqerspus is zoslpus, so qerspus ⊆ zoslpus, so qerspus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nlodvpus is qerspus and quqwpus, so lodvpus ⊆ qerspus, so lodvpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\ntiktpus is lodvpus, so tiktpus ⊆ lodvpus, so tiktpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nqodbpus is tiktpus and pimhpus, so qodbpus ⊆ tiktpus, so qodbpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nnuxypus is qodbpus, so nuxypus ⊆ qodbpus, so nuxypus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nzujrpus is nuxypus and xoswpus, so zujrpus ⊆ nuxypus, so zujrpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\njekypus is zujrpus, so jekypus ⊆ zujrpus, so jekypus ⊆ kalypus.\n\ngezgpus is jekypus, so gezgpus ⊆ jekypus, so gezgpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nsokppus is gezgpus, so sokppus ⊆ gezgpus, so sokppus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nmebdpus is sokppus and tumypus, so mebdpus ⊆ sokppus, so mebdpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nwusvpus is mebdpus, so wusvpus ⊆ mebdpus, so wusvpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nhuwdpus is wusvpus and yanvpus, so huwdpus ⊆ wusvpus, so huwdpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nvoyppus is huwdpus and yiwgpus, so voyppus ⊆ huwdpus, so voyppus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nwifjpus is voyppus and datvpus, so wifjpus ⊆ voyppus, so wifjpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nwijmpus is wifjpus and mohmpus, so wijmpus ⊆ wifjpus, so wijmpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nrusmpus is wijmpus, so rusmpus ⊆ wijmpus, so rusmpus ⊆ kalypus.\n\nx is rusmpus, so x ⊆ rusmpus, so x ⊆ kalypus.\n\nThus, x is contained in kalypus.\n\nSince kalypus is contained in babgpus, babrpus, and babspus, x is contained in all of them.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babgpus and babrpus and babspus.\n\nSo, the answer is true.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

And yuszpus is babqpus.\n\nSo, from above, since x is yuszpus, and yuszpus is babxpus, so x is babxpus.\n\nAlso, yuszpus is babqpus, so x is babqpus.\n\nNow, we need to check if x is babdpus.\n\nWe know that yuszpus is cepqpus, and cepqpus is babdpus. So, since yuszpus is cepqpus and cepqpus is babdpus, that means yuszpus is babdpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is yuszpus, x is babdpus.\n\nSo, x is babdpus, babqpus, and babxpus.\n\nTherefore, it should be true.\n\nLet me double-check the information.\n\nGiven:\n\n1. qagbpus is yuszpus and zupspus. → so qagbpus belongs to both yuszpus and zupspus.\n\n2. yuszpus is babxpus and cislpus. → yuszpus belongs to babxpus and cislpus.\n\n3. zucjpus is qagbpus. → zucjpus belongs to qagbpus.\n\n4. cepqpus is babdpus. → cepqpus belongs to babdpus.\n\n5. x is zucjpus. → x belongs to zucjpus.\n\n6. yuszpus is cepqpus. → yuszpus belongs to cepqpus.\n\n7. yuszpus is babqpus. → yuszpus belongs to babqpus.\n\nFrom 5 and 3: x is zucjpus and zucjpus is qagbpus, so x is qagbpus.\n\nFrom 1: qagbpus is yuszpus and zupspus, so since x is qagbpus, x is yuszpus and zupspus.\n\nSo x is yuszpus.\n\nFrom 2: yuszpus is babxpus and cislpus, so since x is yuszpus, x is babxpus.\n\nFrom 7: yuszpus is babqpus, so x is babqpus.\n\nFrom 6: yuszpus is cepqpus, and from 4: cepqpus is babdpus, so yuszpus is babdpus (since belonging is transitive?).\n\nWe need to be careful about the transitivity.

Not necessarily, because B might be a category that contains A, and C might be a broader category that contains B, so yes, A should belong to C.\n\nFor example, if A is in B and B is in C, then A is in C. So yes, transitivity should hold.\n\nSo, yuszpus is cepqpus and cepqpus is babdpus, so yuszpus is babdpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is yuszpus, x is babdpus.\n\nSo, x is babdpus, babqpus, and babxpus.\n\nThus, the statement is true.\n\nThe question is \"x is babdpus and babqpus and babxpus?\" which means x belongs to all three categories.\n\nAnd we have established that.\n\nSo, answer should be true.",

Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus, babcpus, and babppus. From the given information, x is kucbpus. So, I'll start from there.\n\nx is kucbpus.\n\nNow, kucbpus is vaztpus and sofspus. But I need to find connections to babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nI see that potwpus is babbpus and babcpus. Also, potwpus is babppus and juhxpus. So potwpus seems to be a category that includes babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nBut I need to see if x is related to potwpus.\n\nI have x is kucbpus. Now, kucbpus is vaztpus and sofspus. What is vaztpus? vaztpus is qolspus. And qolspus is qozspus. qozspus is miqcpus. miqcpus is piczpus. piczpus is yimqpus. yimqpus is yirjpus. yirjpus is tamppus. tamppus is colppus and huxzpus. colppus is dudxpus. dudxpus is kipppus and nabdpus. kipppus is doknpus. doknpus is binvpus and cupwpus. binvpus is netzpus and kupbpus. netzpus is zumxpus and yoxvpus and fohcpus and jarqpus. zumxpus is tisgpus. tisgpus is jixnpus and wawvpus. jixnpus is juvwpus. juvwpus is hoblpus and yujrpus. hoblpus is velmpus. velmpus is wagspus and pawfpus. wagspus is lidrpus. lidrpus is budjpus. budjpus is poxqpus and pizlpus. poxqpus is xelppus. xelppus is pechpus and yukvpus. pechpus is figypus and raftpus. figypus is niqtpus. niqtpus is gogppus and nudcpus. gogppus is pozqpus. pozqpus is gezypus. gezypus is lonwpus. lonwpus is jamnpus and pondpus. jamnpus is vonvpus. vonvpus is qalmpus and lenmpus. qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus.\n\nFinally, potwpus is mentioned here. So from this long chain, I see that through various connections, we might link x to potwpus, but I need to see if x is directly or indirectly part of potwpus.\n\nBut potwpus is babbpus and babcpus, and also babppus, so if x is potwpus, then x would be all of those. But is x potwpus? From the chain, it seems convoluted.\n\nI recall that x is kucbpus, and I need to see if kucbpus is related to potwpus.\n\nFrom the above, I have gezyppus is lonwpus, and lonwpus is jamnpus and pondpus, jamnpus is vonvpus, vonvpus is qalmpus and lenmpus, qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus. So qalmpus includes potwpus, but that doesn't mean that everything in the chain is potwpus.\n\nI need to find if kucbpus is a subtype of potwpus or something.\n\nPerhaps I should look for direct relationships.\n\nAnother thing: potwpus is babbpus and babcpus, meaning that babbpus and babcpus are categories under potwpus. Similarly, potwpus is babppus and juhxpus, so babppus is also under potwpus.\n\nSo for x to be babbpus, etc., x must be potwpus or directly under it.\n\nBut from x, which is kucbpus, I need to see if kucbpus is potwpus.\n\nFrom the given, there is no direct statement that kucbpus is potwpus. So I need to see if there is a path.\n\nLet me list all the \"is\" relationships in a hierarchical way.\n\nI see that wagspus is lidrpus, and lidrpus is budjpus, etc., but that might not help.\n\nPerhaps I can start from potwpus and see what leads to it.\n\npotwpus is part of qalmpus since qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus.\n\nqalmpus is part of vonvpus since vonvpus is qalmpus and lenmpus.\n\nvonvpus is part of jamnpus since jamnpus is vonvpus.\n\njamnpus is part of lonwpus since lonwpus is jamnpus and pondpus.\n\nlonwpus is part of gezypus since gezypus is lonwpus.\n\ngezypus is part of gogppus since gogppus is pozqpus and pozqpus is gezypus? Let's see: gogppus is pozqpus? From niqtpus is gogppus and nudcpus, and gogppus is pozqpus? No, from the given: gogppus is pozqpus. Yes, \"gogppus is pozqpus\" and \"pozqpus is gezypus\", so gogppus is pozqpus which is gezypus, so gogppus is gezypus.\n\nBut gogppus is from niqtpus, which is from figypus, etc.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nI am considering that x is kucbpus, and kucbpus is vaztpus and sofspus. vaztpus is qolspus. qolspus is qozspus. qozspus is miqcpus. miqcpus is piczpus. piczpus is yimqpus. yimqpus is yirjpus. yirjpus is tamppus. tamppus is colppus and huxzpus. colppus is dudxpus. dudxpus is kipppus and nabdpus. kipppus is doknpus. doknpus is binvpus and cupwpus. binvpus is netzpus and kupbpus. netzpus is zumxpus and yoxvpus and fohcpus and jarqpus. zumxpus is tisgpus. tisgpus is jixnpus and wawvpus. jixnpus is juvwpus. juvwpus is hoblpus and yujrpus. hoblpus is velmpus. velmpus is wagspus and pawfpus. wagspus is lidrpus. lidrpus is budjpus. budjpus is poxqpus and pizlpus. poxqpus is xelppus. xelppus is pechpus and yukvpus. pechpus is figypus and raftpus. figypus is niqtpus. niqtpus is gogppus and nudcpus. gogppus is pozqpus. pozqpus is gezypus. gezypus is lonwpus. lonwpus is jamnpus and pondpus. jamnpus is vonvpus. vonvpus is qalmpus and lenmpus. qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus.\n\nSo from this, if I follow the chain, kucbpus eventually leads to qalmpus, which includes potwpus. But does that mean kucbpus is potwpus? Not necessarily. Because \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if A is B and B is C, then A is C, so it should be transitive.\n\nIn this context, \"A is B\" means A is contained in B, so it should be transitive. That is, if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nSo let's verify this with a small example. From the given, wagspus is lidrpus, and lidrpus is budjpus, so wagspus is budjpus? But from the given, there is also \"wagspus is pudtpus\" and \"pudtpus is fixppus\", so wagspus is fixppus, etc. So yes, it seems transitive.\n\nTherefore, if I can find a path from kucbpus to potwpus, then x is potwpus.\n\nFrom the chain above, from kucbpus to potwpus, it seems long but possible.\n\nBut let's see if there is a shorter path or if I missed something.\n\nFrom kucbpus, I have kucbpus is vaztpus, and vaztpus is qolspus, etc., but eventually, through many steps, I reach potwpus.\n\nBut in the chain, I have qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus, so qalmpus contains potwpus, so if something is qalmpus, it is potwpus? No, because qalmpus is a category that includes potwpus, so if A is qalmpus, then A is potwpus only if potwpus is a subset of qalmpus, but from \"qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus\", it means that qalmpus consists of potwpus and pehvpus, so potwpus is a part of qalmpus, so if A is qalmpus, it means A is either potwpus or pehvpus, so not necessarily potwpus.\n\nSimilarly, for vonvpus is qalmpus and lenmpus, so if A is vonvpus, then A is qalmpus or lenmpus, so A could be qalmpus, which could be potwpus or pehvpus.\n\nSo to be potwpus, A must be specifically potwpus.\n\nBut from the chain, when we say A is B, and B is C, it means A is contained in B, and B is contained in C, so A is contained in C. So if B is a category that contains C, then A is contained in B, which contains C, so A is contained in C only if C is a subset of B, but from \"B is C\" it means B is contained in C, so C is a larger category.\n\nLet's clarify the meaning.\n\nThe note says: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \"\n\nSo, if A is B, it means A is a member of B or A is a subset of B? The phrase \"A belongs to category B\" suggests that A is an instance of B, so B is a category, and A is one of its members. But then \"A is contained in B\" might mean that A is a subset of B.\n\nBut in the context, from the statements, it seems that \"A is B\" means that A is a type of B, so B is a broader category.\n\nFor example, \"wagspus is lidrpus\" means wagspus is a type of lidrpus, so lidrpus is a category that includes wagspus.\n\nSimilarly, \"lidrpus is budjpus\" means lidrpus is a type of budjpus, so budjpus includes lidrpus.\n\nTherefore, if A is B and B is C, then A is C, because A is a type of B, and B is a type of C, so A is a type of C.\n\nSo transitivity holds.\n\nIn the case of \"qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus\", this means that qalmpus is a type of potwpus? Or does it mean that qalmpus consists of potwpus and pehvpus? The word \"is\" might be ambiguous, but from the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if \"qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus\", it might mean that qalmpus belongs to both potwpus and pehvpus, which would imply that potwpus and pehvpus are broader categories, but typically, we don't say something belongs to two categories simultaneously in this way, but from the statement, it might be that qalmpus is a subtype of potwpus and also a subtype of pehvpus.\n\nBut let's look at other statements.\n\nFor example, \"netzpus is zumxpus and yoxvpus and fohcpus and jarqpus\" which means netzpus belongs to zumxpus, yoxvpus, fohcpus, and jarqpus, so netzpus is a type of each of them.\n\nSimilarly, \"potwpus is babbpus and babcpus\" means potwpus is a type of babbpus and also a type of babcpus? But that seems odd because usually, we think of larger categories containing smaller ones, but here it might be that babbpus is a category, and potwpus is one of its members, so potwpus is a type of babbpus.\n\nBut then \"potwpus is babppus and juhxpus\" means potwpus is also a type of babppus and juhxpus.\n\nSo for the question, \"x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus\" means x is a type of babbpus, etc.\n\nBut from above, if potwpus is babbpus, then for x to be babbpus, x must be potwpus or something that is potwpus.\n\nBut from transitivity, if x is potwpus, and potwpus is babbpus, then x is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo the key is to see if x is potwpus.\n\nSo from x is kucbpus, I need to see if kucbpus is potwpus.\n\nFrom the long chain, kucbpus leads to qalmpus, and qalmpus is potwpus? From \"qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus\", it means that qalmpus is a type of potwpus, so yes, qalmpus is potwpus.\n\nTherefore, if kucbpus is qalmpus, then kucbpus is potwpus.\n\nSo I need to see if kucbpus is qalmpus.\n\nFrom the chain: kucbpus -> vaztpus -> qolspus -> qozspus -> miqcpus -> piczpus -> yimqpus -> yirjpus -> tamppus -> colppus -> dudxpus -> kipppus -> doknpus -> binvpus -> netzpus -> zumxpus -> tisgpus -> jixnpus -> juvwpus -> hoblpus -> velmpus -> wagspus -> lidrpus -> budjpus -> poxqpus -> xelppus -> pechpus -> figypus -> niqtpus -> gogppus -> pozqpus -> gezypus -> lonwpus -> jamnpus -> vonvpus -> qalmpus.\n\nThat's a long chain, but each \"is\" should allow transitivity, so kucbpus is qalmpus.\n\nTherefore, kucbpus is qalmpus, and since qalmpus is potwpus (because qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus, so qalmpus is potwpus), so kucbpus is potwpus.\n\nThen, since potwpus is babbpus and babcpus and babppus (from \"potwpus is babbpus and babcpus\" and \"potwpus is babppus and juhxpus\"), so potwpus is babbpus, potwpus is babcpus, and potwpus is babppus.\n\nTherefore, kucbpus is babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nThus, x is kucbpus, so x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there is any break in the chain.\n\nFrom the given, we have:\n\nkucbpus is vaztpus → vaztpus is qolspus → qolspus is qozspus → qozspus is miqcpus → miqcpus is piczpus → piczpus is yimqpus → yimqpus is yirjpus → yirjpus is tamppus → tamppus is colppus and huxzpus, so tamppus is colppus → colppus is dudxpus → dudxpus is kipppus and nabdpus, so dudxpus is kipppus → kipppus is doknpus → doknpus is binvpus and cupwpus, so doknpus is binvpus → binvpus is netzpus and kupbpus, so binvpus is netzpus → netzpus is zumxpus and yoxvpus and fohcpus and jarqpus, so netzpus is zumxpus → zumxpus is tisgpus → tisgpus is jixnpus and wawvpus, so tisgpus is jixnpus → jixnpus is juvwpus → juvwpus is hoblpus and yujrpus, so juvwpus is hoblpus → hoblpus is velmpus → velmpus is wagspus and pawfpus, so velmpus is wagspus → wagspus is lidrpus → lidrpus is budjpus → budjpus is poxqpus and pizlpus, so budjpus is poxqpus → poxqpus is xelppus → xelppus is pechpus and yukvpus, so xelppus is pechpus → pechpus is figypus and raftpus, so pechpus is figypus → figypus is niqtpus → niqtpus is gogppus and nudcpus, so niqtpus is gogppus → gogppus is pozqpus → pozqpus is gezypus → gezypus is lonwpus → lonwpus is jamnpus and pondpus, so lonwpus is jamnpus → jamnpus is vonvpus → vonvpus is qalmpus and lenmpus, so vonvpus is qalmpus → qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus, so qalmpus is potwpus.\n\nSo indeed, kucbpus is potwpus.\n\nTherefore, x is potwpus, and thus x is babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nSo the statement is true.",

From \"qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus\", it means that qalmpus is a type of potwpus, so yes, qalmpus is potwpus.\n\nTherefore, if kucbpus is qalmpus, then kucbpus is potwpus.\n\nSo I need to see if kucbpus is qalmpus.\n\nFrom the chain: kucbpus -> vaztpus -> qolspus -> qozspus -> miqcpus -> piczpus -> yimqpus -> yirjpus -> tamppus -> colppus -> dudxpus -> kipppus -> doknpus -> binvpus -> netzpus -> zumxpus -> tisgpus -> jixnpus -> juvwpus -> hoblpus -> velmpus -> wagspus -> lidrpus -> budjpus -> poxqpus -> xelppus -> pechpus -> figypus -> niqtpus -> gogppus -> pozqpus -> gezypus -> lonwpus -> jamnpus -> vonvpus -> qalmpus.\n\nThat's a long chain, but each \"is\" should allow transitivity, so kucbpus is qalmpus.\n\nTherefore, kucbpus is qalmpus, and since qalmpus is potwpus (because qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus, so qalmpus is potwpus), so kucbpus is potwpus.\n\nThen, since potwpus is babbpus and babcpus and babppus (from \"potwpus is babbpus and babcpus\" and \"potwpus is babppus and juhxpus\"), so potwpus is babbpus, potwpus is babcpus, and potwpus is babppus.\n\nTherefore, kucbpus is babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nThus, x is kucbpus, so x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check if there is any break in the chain.\n\nFrom the given, we have:\n\nkucbpus is vaztpus → vaztpus is qolspus → qolspus is qozspus → qozspus is miqcpus → miqcpus is piczpus → piczpus is yimqpus → yimqpus is yirjpus → yirjpus is tamppus → tamppus is colppus and huxzpus, so tamppus is colppus → colppus is dudxpus → dudxpus is kipppus and nabdpus, so dudxpus is kipppus → kipppus is doknpus → doknpus is binvpus and cupwpus, so doknpus is binvpus → binvpus is netzpus and kupbpus, so binvpus is netzpus → netzpus is zumxpus and yoxvpus and fohcpus and jarqpus, so netzpus is zumxpus → zumxpus is tisgpus → tisgpus is jixnpus and wawvpus, so tisgpus is jixnpus → jixnpus is juvwpus → juvwpus is hoblpus and yujrpus, so juvwpus is hoblpus → hoblpus is velmpus → velmpus is wagspus and pawfpus, so velmpus is wagspus → wagspus is lidrpus → lidrpus is budjpus → budjpus is poxqpus and pizlpus, so budjpus is poxqpus → poxqpus is xelppus → xelppus is pechpus and yukvpus, so xelppus is pechpus → pechpus is figypus and raftpus, so pechpus is figypus → figypus is niqtpus → niqtpus is gogppus and nudcpus, so niqtpus is gogppus → gogppus is pozqpus → pozqpus is gezypus → gezypus is lonwpus → lonwpus is jamnpus and pondpus, so lonwpus is jamnpus → jamnpus is vonvpus → vonvpus is qalmpus and lenmpus, so vonvpus is qalmpus → qalmpus is potwpus and pehvpus, so qalmpus is potwpus.\n\nSo indeed, kucbpus is potwpus.\n\nTherefore, x is potwpus, and thus x is babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nSo the statement is true.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

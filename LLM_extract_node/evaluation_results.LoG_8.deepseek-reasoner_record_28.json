  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus. That means x should belong to all three categories: babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nI have a lot of information about different pus categories. Let me list out what I know about x.\n\nFrom the given information: x is cewkpus. And cewkpus is jughpus. So x is jughpus.\n\nNow, jughpus is coxkpus and dovmpus. So x is coxkpus and dovmpus.\n\ncoxkpus is xiylpus. So x is xiylpus.\n\nxiylpus is vizgpus. So x is vizgpus.\n\nvizgpus is butlpus and popwpus. So x is butlpus and popwpus.\n\nbutlpus is wizspus and sifzpus. So x is wizspus and sifzpus.\n\nwizspus is pozqpus. But also, wizspus is peqhpus. From the information: wizspus is pozqpus and wizspus is peqhpus. But since \"is\" means belongs to, it might be that wizspus belongs to multiple categories, but for x, since x is wizspus, x belongs to those categories too.\n\nBut I need to find if x is babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nI also have information about other pus.\n\nNow, let's see about babbpus. From the information: juvlpus is babbpus and gelnpus. So babbpus is a category that contains juvlpus? No, \"juvlpus is babbpus\" means juvlpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus is a category that includes juvlpus.\n\nSimilarly, babcpus: sajmpus is babcpus and dovkpus. So sajmpus belongs to babcpus.\n\nAnd babppus: foqkpus is babppus. So foqkpus belongs to babppus.\n\nI need x to belong to all these.\n\nBut x is vizgpus, which is butlpus, and so on. I need to see if x is connected to these bab categories.\n\nI also have that sajmpus is faqgpus, and faqgpus is kuddpus and qatwpus and tixdpus, but that might not help directly.\n\nLet me list all relationships in a hierarchical way or find paths.\n\nI know that x is cewkpus -> jughpus -> coxkpus -> xiylpus -> vizgpus -> butlpus -> wizspus -> peqhpus? Since wizspus is peqhpus.\n\nwizspus is peqhpus, and wizspus is pozqpus, but for x, since x is wizspus, x is peqhpus.\n\npeqhpus is yedtpus, so x is yedtpus.\n\nyedtpus is wuygpus and nadxpus, so x is wuygpus and nadxpus.\n\nwuygpus is semdpus, so x is semdpus.\n\nsemdpus is tepkpus and sonbpus and qevgpus and rezbpus, so x is tepkpus, sonbpus, etc.\n\ntepkpus is girjpus, but also from earlier, tepkpus is lekcpus? From information: tepkpus is girjpus and also tepkpus is lekcpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom given: tepkpus is girjpus. And separately, tepkpus is lekcpus? No, from the information: \"tepkpus is lekcpus\" is stated? Let me check.\n\nLook: \"tepkpus is girjpus.\" and then \"tepkpus is lekcpus.\"? From the list: \"tepkpus is girjpus.\" and later \"tepkpus is lekcpus.\"? Actually, in the given information, it says: \"tepkpus is girjpus.\" and then \"tepkpus is lekcpus.\"? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe given information: \"tepkpus is girjpus.\" and then later \"tepkpus is lekcpus.\"? I think I misread.\n\nFrom the given: \"tepkpus is girjpus.\" is one statement. Then there is \"lekcpus is tawdpus.\" which is different. And then \"tepkpus is lekcpus.\" is not directly stated. Let's see all statements.\n\nList all \"is\" statements:\n\n1. vizgpus is butlpus and popwpus.\n\n2. sajmpus is babcpus and dovkpus.\n\n3. peqhpus is yedtpus.\n\n4. lekcpus is tawdpus.\n\n5. lijhpus is suwhpus and qontpus.\n\n6. wizspus is pozqpus.\n\n7. xiylpus is vizgpus.\n\n8. jughpus is coxkpus and dovmpus.\n\n9. foqkpus is babppus.\n\n10. tepkpus is girjpus.\n\n11. tinkpus is lijhpus and yivvpus.\n\n12. wizspus is peqhpus.  // this is another for wizspus\n\n13. tawdpus is balypus.\n\n14. wuygpus is semdpus.\n\n15. yedtpus is wuygpus and nadxpus.\n\n16. butlpus is wizspus and sifzpus.\n\n17. tawdpus is sajmpus.  // tawdpus is sajmpus? But from 4, lekcpus is tawdpus, so lekcpus is tawdpus and tawdpus is sajmpus, so lekcpus is sajmpus? But we need to see.\n\n18. sajmpus is foqkpus.  // so sajmpus is foqkpus, and foqkpus is babppus, so sajmpus is babppus? But from 2, sajmpus is babcpus, so sajmpus is both babcpus and babppus? But that might be possible since \"is\" means belongs to, so sajmpus belongs to multiple categories.\n\n19. faqgpus is kuddpus and qatwpus and tixdpus.\n\n20. girjpus is tinkpus and wejjpus.\n\n21. x is cewkpus.\n\n22. cewkpus is jughpus.\n\n23. sajmpus is faqgpus.  // so sajmpus is faqgpus.\n\n24. tepkpus is lekcpus.  // here it is: tepkpus is lekcpus. So from 10, tepkpus is girjpus, and from 24, tepkpus is lekcpus, so tepkpus belongs to both girjpus and lekcpus.\n\n25. juvlpus is helfpus.  //? juvlpus is helfpus? But later also juvlpus is babbpus and gelnpus.\n\n26. coxkpus is xiylpus.  // from 8, jughpus is coxkpus, and coxkpus is xiylpus, so consistent.\n\n27. juvlpus is babbpus and gelnpus.  // so juvlpus belongs to babbpus and gelnpus.\n\n28. suwhpus is juvlpus and judypus.  // so suwhpus belongs to juvlpus and judypus.\n\n29. semdpus is tepkpus and sonbpus and qevgpus and rezbpus.  // so semdpus contains tepkpus, etc.\n\nNow, back to x.\n\nWe have x is cewkpus -> jughpus -> coxkpus -> xiylpus -> vizgpus -> butlpus -> wizspus -> peqhpus -> yedtpus -> wuygpus -> semdpus.\n\nFrom semdpus, it is tepkpus and others, so x is tepkpus? Since semdpus is tepkpus, meaning tepkpus belongs to semdpus? Or does it mean semdpus contains tepkpus? The note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if semdpus is tepkpus, that would mean semdpus belongs to tepkpus? But that seems backwards from the context.\n\nLet's read the note: \"In this context, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\"\n\nSo, \"A is B\" means A is a member of B, so B is a category that contains A.\n\nFor example, \"x is cewkpus\" means x belongs to cewkpus, so cewkpus is a category that includes x.\n\nSimilarly, \"cewkpus is jughpus\" means cewkpus belongs to jughpus, so jughpus is a category that contains cewkpus.\n\nSo in the statement \"semdpus is tepkpus\", it means semdpus belongs to tepkpus? That would be unusual because typically we think of categories containing items, but here it might be that tepkpus is a category that contains semdpus.\n\nBut let's see the statement: \"semdpus is tepkpus and sonbpus and qevgpus and rezbpus.\" This means that semdpus belongs to tepkpus, and to sonbpus, and to qevgpus, and to rezbpus. So tepkpus is a category that contains semdpus.\n\nSimilarly, from earlier, \"wuygpus is semdpus\" means wuygpus belongs to semdpus, so semdpus contains wuygpus.\n\nAnd \"yedtpus is wuygpus and nadxpus\" means yedtpus belongs to wuygpus and to nadxpus, so wuygpus contains yedtpus, and nadxpus contains yedtpus.\n\nSo in general, \"A is B\" means A is a subset of B or A is contained in B, so B is a larger category.\n\nBut sometimes it might be multiple categories.\n\nFor x, we have x belongs to cewkpus, which belongs to jughpus, etc., so we can trace upwards.\n\nBut for x to be babbpus, it means that x belongs to babbpus, so babbpus must be a category that contains x.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo I need to find if babbpus contains x, babcpus contains x, and babppus contains x.\n\nNow, from the information, babbpus contains juvlpus, since \"juvlpus is babbpus\" meaning juvlpus belongs to babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, babcpus contains sajmpus, since \"sajmpus is babcpus\".\n\nAnd babppus contains foqkpus, since \"foqkpus is babppus\".\n\nBut I need to see if x is contained in these categories.\n\nSince x is in many categories, I need to see if x is also in the chain that leads to these bab categories.\n\nBut from the bab categories, they contain specific pus, so for x to be in bab categories, x must be those pus or contained in those pus? No, since \"x is babbpus\" means x belongs to babbpus, so babbpus must contain x directly or through some hierarchy.\n\nBut from the information, babbpus contains juvlpus, so if x is juvlpus or if x is contained in something that is contained in babbpus, but since \"is\" means belongs to, it might be that categories are nested, but for x to belong to babbpus, it must be that babbpus is a category that includes x, which means that x must be equal to or a subset of something that is in babbpus, but since x is a single entity, probably x must be one of the items that belongs to babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, from the statements, when we say \"A is B\", A is an item that belongs to category B.\n\nSo for x to be babbpus, it means that x belongs to the category babbpus, so babbpus must have x as a member.\n\nBut from the information, the members of babbpus are given indirectly: from \"juvlpus is babbpus\", it means juvlpus is a member of babbpus, so babbpus has juvlpus as a member.\n\nSimilarly, babcpus has sajmpus as a member.\n\nBabppus has foqkpus as a member.\n\nSo for x to be a member of babbpus, x must be juvlpus or there must be other members, but from the information, only juvlpus is mentioned as member of babbpus? Is there other?\n\nFrom \"juvlpus is babbpus\" and also \"juvlpus is helfpus\" and \"juvlpus is babbpus and gelnpus\", so babbpus has juvlpus.\n\nBut is there any other thing that is babbpus? Not from the given information.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus, only sajmpus is mentioned as member? From \"sajmpus is babcpus\", so sajmpus is member of babcpus. Also, from \"sajmpus is foqkpus\" and \"sajmpus is faqgpus\", but that doesn't add members to babcpus; babcpus has sajmpus as member.\n\nSimilarly for babppus, \"foqkpus is babppus\", so foqkpus is member of babppus.\n\nSo for x to be babbpus, x must be juvlpus.\n\nSimilarly, for x to be babcpus, x must be sajmpus.\n\nFor x to be babppus, x must be foqkpus.\n\nBut x is cewkpus, which is jughpus, etc., so I need to see if x is juvlpus or x is sajmpus or x is foqkpus.\n\nFrom the information, is x any of these?\n\nLet's see what x is.\n\nx is cewkpus.\n\ncewkpus is jughpus.\n\njughpus is coxkpus and dovmpus.\n\ncoxkpus is xiylpus.\n\nxiylpus is vizgpus.\n\nvizgpus is butlpus and popwpus.\n\nbutlpus is wizspus and sifzpus.\n\nwizspus is pozqpus and also wizspus is peqhpus.\n\npeqhpus is yedtpus.\n\nyedtpus is wuygpus and nadxpus.\n\nwuygpus is semdpus.\n\nsemdpus is tepkpus and sonbpus and qevgpus and rezbpus. So semdpus belongs to tepkpus, meaning tepkpus contains semdpus, so tepkpus is a category that has semdpus as member.\n\nBut x is semdpus? From above, x is wuygpus, and wuygpus is semdpus, so wuygpus belongs to semdpus, so semdpus contains wuygpus, so x is wuygpus, which is contained in semdpus, but for x to be tepkpus, it would require that x belongs to tepkpus, but from \"semdpus is tepkpus\", it means semdpus belongs to tepkpus, so tepkpus contains semdpus, so if x is semdpus, then x belongs to tepkpus, but x is wuygpus, and wuygpus is semdpus? Let's clarify.\n\nFrom \"wuygpus is semdpus\" means wuygpus belongs to semdpus, so semdpus contains wuygpus.\n\nBut x is wuygpus? From earlier: x is yedtpus? yedtpus is wuygpus and nadxpus, so yedtpus belongs to wuygpus, so wuygpus contains yedtpus. But x is yedtpus? Let's trace.\n\nx is cewkpus -> jughpus -> coxkpus -> xiylpus -> vizgpus -> butlpus -> wizspus -> peqhpus -> yedtpus.\n\nSo x is yedtpus? Since x belongs to peqhpus, and peqhpus is yedtpus, meaning peqhpus belongs to yedtpus, so yedtpus contains peqhpus, so since x is peqhpus? No.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nWe have \"peqhpus is yedtpus\" which means peqhpus belongs to yedtpus, so yedtpus is a category that contains peqhpus.\n\nBut x is peqhpus? From above, x is wizspus, and wizspus is peqhpus, meaning wizspus belongs to peqhpus, so peqhpus contains wizspus.\n\nBut x is wizspus, so x belongs to peqhpus? So peqhpus contains x.\n\nThen since peqhpus belongs to yedtpus, yedtpus contains peqhpus, so yedtpus contains x indirectly? But for x, since x is contained in peqhpus, and peqhpus is contained in yedtpus, then x is contained in yedtpus, so x belongs to yedtpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"yedtpus is wuygpus and nadxpus\" means yedtpus belongs to wuygpus and to nadxpus, so wuygpus contains yedtpus, and nadxpus contains yedtpus.\n\nSince x belongs to yedtpus, and yedtpus belongs to wuygpus, then x belongs to wuygpus? Is that correct?\n\nIf A belongs to B, and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C? In set terms, if A is a subset of B, and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C, so yes, A belongs to C.\n\nSimilarly here, since \"is\" means belongs to, so if A is B, and B is C, then A is C.\n\nSo for x, from the chain, we can say x is yedtpus because x is peqhpus and peqhpus is yedtpus, so x is yedtpus.\n\nSimilarly, x is wuygpus because x is yedtpus and yedtpus is wuygpus, so x is wuygpus.\n\nAnd x is semdpus because x is wuygpus and wuygpus is semdpus, so x is semdpus.\n\nThen from \"semdpus is tepkpus\" meaning semdpus is tepkpus, so semdpus belongs to tepkpus, so x belongs to tepkpus, so x is tepkpus.\n\nSimilarly, semdpus is also sonbpus, etc., so x is sonbpus, etc.\n\nBut we need x to be juvlpus or sajmpus or foqkpus.\n\nNow, is x juvlpus? From above, x is tepkpus, and tepkpus is girjpus from \"tepkpus is girjpus\", so x is girjpus.\n\ngirjpus is tinkpus and wejjpus, so x is tinkpus and wejjpus.\n\ntinkpus is lijhpus and yivvpus, so x is lijhpus and yivvpus.\n\nlijhpus is suwhpus and qontpus, so x is suwhpus and qontpus.\n\nsuwhpus is juvlpus and judypus, so x is juvlpus and judypus.\n\nTherefore, x is juvlpus!\n\nSo since x is suwhpus and suwhpus is juvlpus, so x is juvlpus.\n\nAnd since juvlpus is babbpus, meaning juvlpus belongs to babbpus, so x belongs to babbpus, so x is babbpus.\n\nSo one part is true: x is babbpus.\n\nNow, we need x to be babcpus and babppus.\n\nbabcpus contains sajmpus, so for x to be babcpus, x must be sajmpus.\n\nSimilarly, babppus contains foqkpus, so for x to be babppus, x must be foqkpus.\n\nNow, is x sajmpus? From the chain, we have x is juvlpus, but is juvlpus sajmpus? Not directly.\n\nWe also have other relations.\n\nFrom earlier, we have tawdpus is sajmpus? From statement 17: \"tawdpus is sajmpus\" which means tawdpus belongs to sajmpus, so sajmpus contains tawdpus.\n\nAlso, from statement 4: \"lekcpus is tawdpus\" so lekcpus belongs to tawdpus, so tawdpus contains lekcpus.\n\nAnd from statement 24: \"tepkpus is lekcpus\" so tepkpus belongs to lekcpus, so lekcpus contains tepkpus.\n\nBut from earlier, x is tepkpus, so x belongs to lekcpus, so lekcpus contains x.\n\nThen since lekcpus belongs to tawdpus, tawdpus contains lekcpus, so tawdpus contains x.\n\nThen since tawdpus belongs to sajmpus, sajmpus contains tawdpus, so sajmpus contains x.\n\nTherefore, x belongs to sajmpus, so x is sajmpus.\n\nSince sajmpus is babcpus, meaning sajmpus belongs to babcpus, so babcpus contains sajmpus, and since x is sajmpus, then x belongs to babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nSo yes, x is babcpus.\n\nNow, for babppus, we need x to be foqkpus.\n\nFrom above, x is sajmpus, and from statement 18: \"sajmpus is foqkpus\" which means sajmpus belongs to foqkpus, so foqkpus contains sajmpus.\n\nSince x is sajmpus, then foqkpus contains x, so x belongs to foqkpus, so x is foqkpus.\n\nAnd since foqkpus is babppus, meaning foqkpus belongs to babppus, so babppus contains foqkpus, and since x is foqkpus, then x belongs to babppus, so x is babppus.\n\nTherefore, x is babppus.\n\nSo overall, x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me confirm if all steps are consistent.\n\nWe have x is juvlpus from the suwhpus chain.\n\nAnd x is sajmpus from the tawdpus chain.\n\nAnd since sajmpus is foqkpus, x is foqkpus.\n\nAnd since juvlpus is babbpus, x is babbpus.\n\nsajmpus is babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nfoqkpus is babppus, so x is babppus.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, it is true.",

So tepkpus is a category that contains semdpus.\n\nSimilarly, from earlier, \"wuygpus is semdpus\" means wuygpus belongs to semdpus, so semdpus contains wuygpus.\n\nAnd \"yedtpus is wuygpus and nadxpus\" means yedtpus belongs to wuygpus and to nadxpus, so wuygpus contains yedtpus, and nadxpus contains yedtpus.\n\nSo in general, \"A is B\" means A is a subset of B or A is contained in B, so B is a larger category.\n\nBut sometimes it might be multiple categories.\n\nFor x, we have x belongs to cewkpus, which belongs to jughpus, etc., so we can trace upwards.\n\nBut for x to be babbpus, it means that x belongs to babbpus, so babbpus must be a category that contains x.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo I need to find if babbpus contains x, babcpus contains x, and babppus contains x.\n\nNow, from the information, babbpus contains juvlpus, since \"juvlpus is babbpus\" meaning juvlpus belongs to babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, babcpus contains sajmpus, since \"sajmpus is babcpus\".\n\nAnd babppus contains foqkpus, since \"foqkpus is babppus\".\n\nBut I need to see if x is contained in these categories.\n\nSince x is in many categories, I need to see if x is also in the chain that leads to these bab categories.\n\nBut from the bab categories, they contain specific pus, so for x to be in bab categories, x must be those pus or contained in those pus? No, since \"x is babbpus\" means x belongs to babbpus, so babbpus must contain x directly or through some hierarchy.\n\nBut from the information, babbpus contains juvlpus, so if x is juvlpus or if x is contained in something that is contained in babbpus, but since \"is\" means belongs to, it might be that categories are nested, but for x to belong to babbpus, it must be that babbpus is a category that includes x, which means that x must be equal to or a subset of something that is in babbpus, but since x is a single entity, probably x must be one of the items that belongs to babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, from the statements, when we say \"A is B\", A is an item that belongs to category B.\n\nSo for x to be babbpus, it means that x belongs to the category babbpus, so babbpus must have x as a member.\n\nBut from the information, the members of babbpus are given indirectly: from \"juvlpus is babbpus\", it means juvlpus is a member of babbpus, so babbpus has juvlpus as a member.\n\nSimilarly, babcpus has sajmpus as a member.\n\nBabppus has foqkpus as a member.\n\nSo for x to be a member of babbpus, x must be juvlpus or there must be other members, but from the information, only juvlpus is mentioned as member of babbpus? Is there other?\n\nFrom \"juvlpus is babbpus\" and also \"juvlpus is helfpus\" and \"juvlpus is babbpus and gelnpus\", so babbpus has juvlpus.\n\nBut is there any other thing that is babbpus? Not from the given information.\n\nSimilarly for babcpus, only sajmpus is mentioned as member? From \"sajmpus is babcpus\", so sajmpus is member of babcpus. Also, from \"sajmpus is foqkpus\" and \"sajmpus is faqgpus\", but that doesn't add members to babcpus; babcpus has sajmpus as member.\n\nSimilarly for babppus, \"foqkpus is babppus\", so foqkpus is member of babppus.\n\nSo for x to be babbpus, x must be juvlpus.\n\nSimilarly, for x to be babcpus, x must be sajmpus.\n\nFor x to be babppus, x must be foqkpus.\n\nBut x is cewkpus, which is jughpus, etc., so I need to see if x is juvlpus or x is sajmpus or x is foqkpus.\n\nFrom the information, is x any of these?\n\nLet's see what x is.\n\nx is cewkpus.\n\ncewkpus is jughpus.\n\njughpus is coxkpus and dovmpus.\n\ncoxkpus is xiylpus.\n\nxiylpus is vizgpus.\n\nvizgpus is butlpus and popwpus.\n\nbutlpus is wizspus and sifzpus.\n\nwizspus is pozqpus and also wizspus is peqhpus.\n\npeqhpus is yedtpus.\n\nyedtpus is wuygpus and nadxpus.\n\nwuygpus is semdpus.\n\nsemdpus is tepkpus and sonbpus and qevgpus and rezbpus. So semdpus belongs to tepkpus, meaning tepkpus contains semdpus, so tepkpus is a category that has semdpus as member.\n\nBut x is semdpus? From above, x is wuygpus, and wuygpus is semdpus, so wuygpus belongs to semdpus, so semdpus contains wuygpus, so x is wuygpus, which is contained in semdpus, but for x to be tepkpus, it would require that x belongs to tepkpus, but from \"semdpus is tepkpus\", it means semdpus belongs to tepkpus, so tepkpus contains semdpus, so if x is semdpus, then x belongs to tepkpus, but x is wuygpus, and wuygpus is semdpus? Let's clarify.\n\nFrom \"wuygpus is semdpus\" means wuygpus belongs to semdpus, so semdpus contains wuygpus.\n\nBut x is wuygpus? From earlier: x is yedtpus? yedtpus is wuygpus and nadxpus, so yedtpus belongs to wuygpus, so wuygpus contains yedtpus. But x is yedtpus? Let's trace.\n\nx is cewkpus -> jughpus -> coxkpus -> xiylpus -> vizgpus -> butlpus -> wizspus -> peqhpus -> yedtpus.\n\nSo x is yedtpus? Since x belongs to peqhpus, and peqhpus is yedtpus, meaning peqhpus belongs to yedtpus, so yedtpus contains peqhpus, so since x is peqhpus? No.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nWe have \"peqhpus is yedtpus\" which means peqhpus belongs to yedtpus, so yedtpus is a category that contains peqhpus.\n\nBut x is peqhpus? From above, x is wizspus, and wizspus is peqhpus, meaning wizspus belongs to peqhpus, so peqhpus contains wizspus.\n\nBut x is wizspus, so x belongs to peqhpus? So peqhpus contains x.\n\nThen since peqhpus belongs to yedtpus, yedtpus contains peqhpus, so yedtpus contains x indirectly? But for x, since x is contained in peqhpus, and peqhpus is contained in yedtpus, then x is contained in yedtpus, so x belongs to yedtpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"yedtpus is wuygpus and nadxpus\" means yedtpus belongs to wuygpus and to nadxpus, so wuygpus contains yedtpus, and nadxpus contains yedtpus.\n\nSince x belongs to yedtpus, and yedtpus belongs to wuygpus, then x belongs to wuygpus? Is that correct?\n\nIf A belongs to B, and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C? In set terms, if A is a subset of B, and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C, so yes, A belongs to C.\n\nSimilarly here, since \"is\" means belongs to, so if A is B, and B is C, then A is C.\n\nSo for x, from the chain, we can say x is yedtpus because x is peqhpus and peqhpus is yedtpus, so x is yedtpus.\n\nSimilarly, x is wuygpus because x is yedtpus and yedtpus is wuygpus, so x is wuygpus.\n\nAnd x is semdpus because x is wuygpus and wuygpus is semdpus, so x is semdpus.\n\nThen from \"semdpus is tepkpus\" meaning semdpus is tepkpus, so semdpus belongs to tepkpus, so x belongs to tepkpus, so x is tepkpus.\n\nSimilarly, semdpus is also sonbpus, etc., so x is sonbpus, etc.\n\nBut we need x to be juvlpus or sajmpus or foqkpus.\n\nNow, is x juvlpus? From above, x is tepkpus, and tepkpus is girjpus from \"tepkpus is girjpus\", so x is girjpus.\n\ngirjpus is tinkpus and wejjpus, so x is tinkpus and wejjpus.\n\ntinkpus is lijhpus and yivvpus, so x is lijhpus and yivvpus.\n\nlijhpus is suwhpus and qontpus, so x is suwhpus and qontpus.\n\nsuwhpus is juvlpus and judypus, so x is juvlpus and judypus.\n\nTherefore, x is juvlpus!\n\nSo since x is suwhpus and suwhpus is juvlpus, so x is juvlpus.\n\nAnd since juvlpus is babbpus, meaning juvlpus belongs to babbpus, so x belongs to babbpus, so x is babbpus.\n\nSo one part is true: x is babbpus.\n\nNow, we need x to be babcpus and babppus.\n\nbabcpus contains sajmpus, so for x to be babcpus, x must be sajmpus.\n\nSimilarly, babppus contains foqkpus, so for x to be babppus, x must be foqkpus.\n\nNow, is x sajmpus? From the chain, we have x is juvlpus, but is juvlpus sajmpus? Not directly.\n\nWe also have other relations.\n\nFrom earlier, we have tawdpus is sajmpus? From statement 17: \"tawdpus is sajmpus\" which means tawdpus belongs to sajmpus, so sajmpus contains tawdpus.\n\nAlso, from statement 4: \"lekcpus is tawdpus\" so lekcpus belongs to tawdpus, so tawdpus contains lekcpus.\n\nAnd from statement 24: \"tepkpus is lekcpus\" so tepkpus belongs to lekcpus, so lekcpus contains tepkpus.\n\nBut from earlier, x is tepkpus, so x belongs to lekcpus, so lekcpus contains x.\n\nThen since lekcpus belongs to tawdpus, tawdpus contains lekcpus, so tawdpus contains x.\n\nThen since tawdpus belongs to sajmpus, sajmpus contains tawdpus, so sajmpus contains x.\n\nTherefore, x belongs to sajmpus, so x is sajmpus.\n\nSince sajmpus is babcpus, meaning sajmpus belongs to babcpus, so babcpus contains sajmpus, and since x is sajmpus, then x belongs to babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nSo yes, x is babcpus.\n\nNow, for babppus, we need x to be foqkpus.\n\nFrom above, x is sajmpus, and from statement 18: \"sajmpus is foqkpus\" which means sajmpus belongs to foqkpus, so foqkpus contains sajmpus.\n\nSince x is sajmpus, then foqkpus contains x, so x belongs to foqkpus, so x is foqkpus.\n\nAnd since foqkpus is babppus, meaning foqkpus belongs to babppus, so babppus contains foqkpus, and since x is foqkpus, then x belongs to babppus, so x is babppus.\n\nTherefore, x is babppus.\n\nSo overall, x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me confirm if all steps are consistent.\n\nWe have x is juvlpus from the suwhpus chain.\n\nAnd x is sajmpus from the tawdpus chain.\n\nAnd since sajmpus is foqkpus, x is foqkpus.\n\nAnd since juvlpus is babbpus, x is babbpus.\n\nsajmpus is babcpus, so x is babcpus.\n\nfoqkpus is babppus, so x is babppus.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, it is true.",

    "x is cewkpus -> jughpus -> coxkpus -> xiylpus -> vizgpus -> butlpus -> wizspus -> peqhpus -> yedtpus.",
    "So x is yedtpus?",
    "Since x belongs to peqhpus, and peqhpus is yedtpus, meaning peqhpus belongs to yedtpus, so yedtpus contains peqhpus, so since x is peqhpus?",
    "No.",
    "Let's think carefully.",
    "We have \"peqhpus is yedtpus\" which means peqhpus belongs to yedtpus, so yedtpus is a category that contains peqhpus.",
    "But x is peqhpus?",
    "From above, x is wizspus, and wizspus is peqhpus, meaning wizspus belongs to peqhpus, so peqhpus contains wizspus.",
    "But x is wizspus, so x belongs to peqhpus?",
    "So peqhpus contains x.",
    "Then since peqhpus belongs to yedtpus, yedtpus contains peqhpus, so yedtpus contains x indirectly?",
    "But for x, since x is contained in peqhpus, and peqhpus is contained in yedtpus, then x is contained in yedtpus, so x belongs to yedtpus.",
    "Similarly, \"yedtpus is wuygpus and nadxpus\" means yedtpus belongs to wuygpus and to nadxpus, so wuygpus contains yedtpus, and nadxpus contains yedtpus.",
    "Since x belongs to yedtpus, and yedtpus belongs to wuygpus, then x belongs to wuygpus?",
    "Is that correct?",
    "If A belongs to B, and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C?",
    "In set terms, if A is a subset of B, and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C, so yes, A belongs to C.",
    "Similarly here, since \"is\" means belongs to, so if A is B, and B is C, then A is C.",
    "So for x, from the chain, we can say x is yedtpus because x is peqhpus and peqhpus is yedtpus, so x is yedtpus.",
    "Similarly, x is wuygpus because x is yedtpus and yedtpus is wuygpus, so x is wuygpus.",
    "And x is semdpus because x is wuygpus and wuygpus is semdpus, so x is semdpus.",
    "Then from \"semdpus is tepkpus\" meaning semdpus is tepkpus, so semdpus belongs to tepkpus, so x belongs to tepkpus, so x is tepkpus.",
    "Similarly, semdpus is also sonbpus, etc.",
    ", so x is sonbpus, etc.",
    "But we need x to be juvlpus or sajmpus or foqkpus.",
    "Now, is x juvlpus?",
    "From above, x is tepkpus, and tepkpus is girjpus from \"tepkpus is girjpus\", so x is girjpus.",
    "girjpus is tinkpus and wejjpus, so x is tinkpus and wejjpus.",
    "tinkpus is lijhpus and yivvpus, so x is lijhpus and yivvpus.",
    "lijhpus is suwhpus and qontpus, so x is suwhpus and qontpus.",
    "suwhpus is juvlpus and judypus, so x is juvlpus and judypus.",
    "Therefore, x is juvlpus!",
    "So since x is suwhpus and suwhpus is juvlpus, so x is juvlpus.",
    "And since juvlpus is babbpus, meaning juvlpus belongs to babbpus, so x belongs to babbpus, so x is babbpus.",
    "So one part is true: x is babbpus.",
    "Now, we need x to be babcpus and babppus.",
    "babcpus contains sajmpus, so for x to be babcpus, x must be sajmpus.",
    "Similarly, babppus contains foqkpus, so for x to be babppus, x must be foqkpus.",
    "Now, is x sajmpus?",
    "From the chain, we have x is juvlpus, but is juvlpus sajmpus?",
    "Not directly.",
    "We also have other relations.",
    "From earlier, we have tawdpus is sajmpus?",
    "From statement 17: \"tawdpus is sajmpus\" which means tawdpus belongs to sajmpus, so sajmpus contains tawdpus.",
    "Also, from statement 4: \"lekcpus is tawdpus\" so lekcpus belongs to tawdpus, so tawdpus contains lekcpus.",
    "And from statement 24: \"tepkpus is lekcpus\" so tepkpus belongs to lekcpus, so lekcpus contains tepkpus.",
    "But from earlier, x is tepkpus, so x belongs to lekcpus, so lekcpus contains x.",
    "Then since lekcpus belongs to tawdpus, tawdpus contains lekcpus, so tawdpus contains x.",
    "Then since tawdpus belongs to sajmpus, sajmpus contains tawdpus, so sajmpus contains x.",
    "Therefore, x belongs to sajmpus, so x is sajmpus.",
    "Since sajmpus is babcpus, meaning sajmpus belongs to babcpus, so babcpus contains sajmpus, and since x is sajmpus, then x belongs to babcpus, so x is babcpus.",
    "So yes, x is babcpus.",
    "Now, for babppus, we need x to be foqkpus.",
    "From above, x is sajmpus, and from statement 18: \"sajmpus is foqkpus\" which means sajmpus belongs to foqkpus, so foqkpus contains sajmpus.",
    "Since x is sajmpus, then foqkpus contains x, so x belongs to foqkpus, so x is foqkpus.",
    "And since foqkpus is babppus, meaning foqkpus belongs to babppus, so babppus contains foqkpus, and since x is foqkpus, then x belongs to babppus, so x is babppus.",
    "Therefore, x is babppus.",
    "So overall, x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus.",
    "So the answer should be true.",
    "But let me confirm if all steps are consistent.",
    "We have x is juvlpus from the suwhpus chain.",
    "And x is sajmpus from the tawdpus chain.",
    "And since sajmpus is foqkpus, x is foqkpus.",
    "And since juvlpus is babbpus, x is babbpus.",
    "sajmpus is babcpus, so x is babcpus.",
    "foqkpus is babppus, so x is babppus.",
    "So all good.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

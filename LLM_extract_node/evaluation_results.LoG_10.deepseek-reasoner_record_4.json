  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus. From the given information, x is defined as: \"x is yupspus and gubcpus.\" But I need to find connections to babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus.\n\nI should trace what each of these babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus are. Let me look through the information.\n\nStarting with babgpus: I see \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" Also, \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" from another line? Let me check.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- yexbpus is babgpus. (given)\n\nBut also, later: \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" – wait, no, I see \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" isn't directly stated. Let me read carefully.\n\nI have: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? Wait, no, I see \"yexbpus is babkpus\" from another part? Let's see.\n\nActually, from the information: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then later: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? I need to find all mentions.\n\nList all relevant points:\n\n- yexbpus is babgpus. (from \"yexbpus is babgpus.\")\n\n- Also, \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? I don't see that directly. I see \"yexbpus is babkpus\" might be a mistake. Let's read the given information.\n\nGiven: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then later: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? No, in the text, it says: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then separately, \"yexbpus is babkpus.\" isn't stated. Instead, I see: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" might be inferred? No.\n\nWait, I have: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" from one line, and from another line: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? Let's scan the entire text.\n\nThe text says: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then later it says: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? Actually, upon closer look, I see: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" is given, and then in a different part, it says: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? No, I think I misread.\n\nLet's list all sentences from the given information that mention yexbpus.\n\nFrom the given:\n\n- yexbpus is babgpus.  (this is direct)\n\n- lixjpus is yexbpus and kasnpus.  (so lixjpus contains yexbpus)\n\n- yetmpus is lixjpus.  (so yetmpus contains lixjpus, which contains yexbpus)\n\nBut where is babkpus? I see \"yexbpus is babkpus\" is not directly stated. Instead, I see: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" might be from another part? Wait, no.\n\nI see a line: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\" is not in the text. But in the text, there is: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and also \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" is not directly said.\n\nAnother line: \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" – no, from \"lesbpus is waxqpus and lafzpus\" no mention of yexbpus.\n\nI think I need to find babkpus separately.\n\nLet's look for babkpus. From the text: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" is not stated. But I see: \"yexbpus is babgpus\" and then later \"yexbpus is babkpus\" might be a error? Wait, no.\n\nIn the text, there is a line: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? Let's read the very end of the given information: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\" is not there. But I see: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" is not said.\n\nPerhaps I missed it. Let's read the given information carefully line by line.\n\nThe given information is long, but let's extract only relevant parts for babgpus, babkpus, babmpus.\n\nFirst, babgpus: we have \"yexbpus is babgpus\" so babgpus contains yexbpus or yexbpus is a type of babgpus.\n\nNow for babkpus: I need to find where babkpus is mentioned. From the text: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" is not stated. But I see \"yexbpus is babkpus\" might be from a different context? No.\n\nWait, in the text, there is: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" actually, let's look at the line: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then later, after other things, there is: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? I don't see it.\n\nLet's search for \"babkpus\" in the text. From the text: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" is not present. Instead, I see: \"yexbpus is babgpus\" and then \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" is not there.\n\nBut I see a line: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" is not in the given. What is in the given is: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then much later, \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" is not said. Instead, I have: \"lesbpus is waxqpus and lafzpus\" and also \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" is not stated.\n\nBut from \"lixjpus is yexbpus and kasnpus\" and \"yetmpus is lixjpus\" but that doesn't give babkpus.\n\nPerhaps I misread the question. The question is about x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus.\n\nBut from the given, x is yupspus and gubcpus, so I need to see if yupspus or gubcpus is connected to babgpus, etc.\n\nBut for babkpus, I need to find what babkpus is.\n\nLet's list all occurrences of \"babkpus\" in the given text. Upon careful reading, I see that \"babkpus\" is mentioned only once in the entire text? Let's see.\n\nFrom the given text: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" that's one.\n\nThen later: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\" is not there. But wait, at the very end of the given information, there is a line: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? No, the last few lines are: \"guvgpus is wudbpus.\" so no \"yexbpus is babkpus\".\n\nBut in the beginning, I have \"yexbpus is babgpus\" and that's it.\n\nPerhaps from another part? Let's read the line: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then later \"yexbpus is babkpus\" might be implied? No.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in my reading. Let's look at the given information as provided in the question.\n\nThe user wrote: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then later, after other things, there is: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? Let's copy the given text and search for \"babkpus\".\n\nHere is the given text: \"gupppus is kocmpus. lifzpus is xujjpus. zakzpus is borxpus and yuqqpus. kerdpus is pemfpus and hafzpus. yedxpus is xuwfpus. lowdpus is kunmpus and deshpus. mefxpus is lowdpus. yexbpus is babgpus. lofmpus is welgpus and dewqpus. fizjpus is labbpus and selfpus. puwbpus is dovvpus. lukypus is yenlpus. podcpus is borqpus and cayrpus. jennpus is rovrpus and tubtpus and qigwpus. pajbpus is cixmpus. bohypus is relvpus and gofvpus. mimjpus is mefppus. rovrpus is nutnpus and pizhpus. gotxpus is saygpus. wudbpus is lukypus. relvpus is dajfpus and yanlpus. nodnpus is doktpus. nutnpus is yecmpus. pafypus is joqspus. zucnpus is lofmpus. joqspus is toxypus. qujkpus is pafypus and jajppus. motwpus is sinlpus and gadypus. saygpus is gelrpus. toxypus is zaqvpus and mirypus. kintpus is xabjpus and fobmpus. rovrpus is motwpus. cepcpus is gejrpus. pidwpus is biktpus and qomxpus. lesbpus is waxqpus and lafzpus. borqpus is dexvpus. lixjpus is yexbpus and kasnpus. yecmpus is bohypus. gejrpus is pidwpus and yiwwpus. dexvpus is gotxpus and simwpus. yuhtpus is zakzpus. kocmpus is mimjpus and vojhpus. yedxpus is soqmpus and mizzpus. biktpus is messpus. zatxpus is fizjpus and nimppus and mapcpus. x is yupspus and gubcpus. vigspus is lelrpus and lizcpus. kunmpus is vigspus. sinlpus is yerjpus. nubfpus is mefxpus and qikbpus. labbpus is gupppus and xikppus. vabxpus is geqbpus. nutnpus is zaxhpus. tikzpus is yetmpus. yexbpus is babkpus. pemfpus is toplpus and hihcpus. xuwfpus is babmpus. yedxpus is guzcpus and zorspus. biktpus is kerdpus. doktpus is zucnpus. yenlpus is yalzpus. xujjpus is guvgpus. ramlpus is begcpus. pidwpus is vabxpus. messpus is fecxpus. hosvpus is kintpus and zuxgpus. zaqvpus is ruflpus and vuqypus. dovvpus is yuhtpus. yerjpus is kiykpus and locgpus. cuywpus is nodnpus. jefgpus is qujkpus. yetmpus is lixjpus. begcpus is votppus. tikzpus is newppus. yalzpus is jefgpus and xaczpus and tisjpus. yupspus is pajbpus. gelrpus is yedxpus and hovlpus. yedxpus is xumxpus and ciwypus. cixmpus is jennpus. nodnpus is padypus. lifzpus is cuywpus. dajfpus is cepcpus and dojvpus and bilgpus. votppus is hosvpus. lelrpus is zatxpus and yegvpus. yexbpus is lesbpus. toplpus is lifzpus and qivbpus and najjpus. fujgpus is podcpus and ziywpus. xabjpus is nubfpus. mefppus is tikzpus. doktpus is ramlpus and cewhpus. fecxpus is puwbpus and metwpus. ruflpus is fujgpus and fedmpus and remkpus. guvgpus is wudbpus.\"\n\nAh! I missed it. In the text, there is: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\" It is there! Let's see: after \"tikzpus is yetmpus.\" there is \"yexbpus is babkpus.\" So yes, yexbpus is also babkpus.\n\nSimilarly, for babmpus, we have \"xuwfpus is babmpus.\" and from \"yedxpus is xuwfpus\", so yedxpus is xuwfpus, which is babmpus, so yedxpus is babmpus.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- yexbpus is babgpus\n\n- yexbpus is babkpus\n\n- yedxpus is xuwfpus, and xuwfpus is babmpus, so yedxpus is babmpus\n\nNow, the question is about x. x is yupspus and gubcpus.\n\nI need to see if x is connected to yexbpus or yedxpus.\n\nSo, I need to find if yupspus or gubcpus is related to yexbpus or yedxpus.\n\nFirst, let's find what yupspus is. From the text: \"yupspus is pajbpus.\" and \"x is yupspus and gubcpus.\" so yupspus is pajbpus.\n\npajbpus is cixmpus. cixmpus is jennpus. jennpus is rovrpus and tubtpus and qigwpus. rovrpus is nutnpus and pizhpus. Also, rovrpus is motwpus. nutnpus is yecmpus. yecmpus is bohypus. bohypus is relvpus and gofvpus. relvpus is dajfpus and yanlpus. dajfpus is cepcpus and dojvpus and bilgpus. cepcpus is gejrpus. gejrpus is pidwpus and yiwwpus. pidwpus is biktpus and qomxpus. pidwpus is also vabxpus. biktpus is messpus. biktpus is kerdpus. kerdpus is pemfpus and hafzpus. pemfpus is toplpus and hihcpus. toplpus is lifzpus and qivbpus and najjpus. lifzpus is xujjpus. lifzpus is cuywpus. cuywpus is nodnpus. nodnpus is doktpus. nodnpus is padypus. doktpus is zucnpus. doktpus is ramlpus and cewhpus. ramlpus is begcpus. begcpus is votppus. votppus is hosvpus. hosvpus is kintpus and zuxgpus. kintpus is xabjpus and fobmpus. xabjpus is nubfpus. nubfpus is mefxpus and qikbpus. mefxpus is lowdpus. lowdpus is kunmpus and deshpus. kunmpus is vigspus. vigspus is lelrpus and lizcpus. lelrpus is zatxpus and yegvpus. zatxpus is fizjpus and nimppus and mapcpus. fizjpus is labbpus and selfpus. labbpus is gupppus and xikppus. gupppus is kocmpus. kocmpus is mimjpus and vojhpus. mimjpus is mefppus. mefppus is tikzpus. tikzpus is yetmpus. tikzpus is newppus. yetmpus is lixjpus. lixjpus is yexbpus and kasnpus. So finally, through this long chain, we see that yupspus eventually connects to yexbpus.\n\nSince lixjpus is yexbpus, and yetmpus is lixjpus, and tikzpus is yetmpus, and mefppus is tikzpus, and mimjpus is mefppus, and kocmpus is mimjpus, and gupppus is kocmpus, and labbpus is gupppus, and fizjpus is labbpus, and zatxpus is fizjpus, and lelrpus is zatxpus, and vigspus is lelrpus, and kunmpus is vigspus, and lowdpus is kunmpus, and mefxpus is lowdpus, and nubfpus is mefxpus, and xabjpus is nubfpus, and kintpus is xabjpus, and hosvpus is kintpus, and votppus is hosvpus, and begcpus is votppus, and ramlpus is begcpus, and doktpus is ramlpus, and nodnpus is doktpus, and cuywpus is nodnpus, and lifzpus is cuywpus, and toplpus is lifzpus, and pemfpus is toplpus, and kerdpus is pemfpus, and biktpus is kerdpus, and pidwpus is biktpus, and gejrpus is pidwpus, and cepcpus is gejrpus, and dajfpus is cepcpus, and relvpus is dajfpus, and bohypus is relvpus, and yecmpus is bohypus, and nutnpus is yecmpus, and rovrpus is nutnpus, and jennpus is rovrpus, and cixmpus is jennpus, and pajbpus is cixmpus, and yupspus is pajbpus.\n\nSo yupspus is connected to jennpus, which is connected to rovrpus, which is connected to nutnpus, which is connected to yecmpus, which is connected to bohypus, which is connected to relvpus, which is connected to dajfpus, which is connected to cepcpus, which is connected to gejrpus, which is connected to pidwpus, which is connected to biktpus, which is connected to kerdpus, which is connected to pemfpus, which is connected to toplpus, which is connected to lifzpus, which is connected to cuywpus, which is connected to nodnpus, which is connected to doktpus, which is connected to ramlpus, which is connected to begcpus, which is connected to votppus, which is connected to hosvpus, which is connected to kintpus, which is connected to xabjpus, which is connected to nubfpus, which is connected to mefxpus, which is connected to lowdpus, which is connected to kunmpus, which is connected to vigspus, which is connected to lelrpus, which is connected to zatxpus, which is connected to fizjpus, which is connected to labbpus, which is connected to gupppus, which is connected to kocmpus, which is connected to mimjpus, which is connected to mefppus, which is connected to tikzpus, which is connected to yetmpus, which is connected to lixjpus, which is connected to yexbpus.\n\nTherefore, since yupspus is ultimately connected to yexbpus, and yexbpus is babgpus and babkpus, so yupspus is babgpus and babkpus.\n\nBut x is yupspus, so x is yupspus, which is babgpus and babkpus.\n\nNow, we also need x to be babmpus. babmpus is related to yedxpus, since yedxpus is xuwfpus and xuwfpus is babmpus, so yedxpus is babmpus.\n\nSo we need to see if x is connected to yedxpus.\n\nx is yupspus and gubcpus. We have yupspus, but we need to see if yupspus or gubcpus is connected to yedxpus.\n\nFrom above, yupspus is connected to yexbpus, but yexbpus is not directly yedxpus. We need yedxpus.\n\nNow, let's see if gubcpus is connected to yedxpus. But what is gubcpus? From the text, x is gubcpus, but we don't have any other information about gubcpus. Let's check the given information.\n\nThe given information says: \"x is yupspus and gubcpus.\" but there is no other mention of gubcpus. So we don't know what gubcpus is or what it contains. So from the given, we cannot connect gubcpus to anything else.\n\nTherefore, for x to be babmpus, we need either yupspus to be connected to yedxpus or gubcpus to be connected to yedxpus.\n\nBut from the chains, yupspus is connected to yexbpus, but not necessarily to yedxpus.\n\nNow, is there a connection between yexbpus and yedxpus? From the given, yexbpus and yedxpus are different entities, and there is no direct link between them.\n\nLet's see if yupspus is connected to yedxpus through other means.\n\nFrom the chain above, yupspus goes through a long path to yexbpus, but yedxpus is not in that path.\n\nNow, let's look for yedxpus. From the text: \"yedxpus is xuwfpus.\" and \"xuwfpus is babmpus.\" so yedxpus is babmpus.\n\nAlso, \"yedxpus is soqmpus and mizzpus.\" and \"yedxpus is guzcpus and zorspus.\" and \"gelrpus is yedxpus and hovlpus.\" and \"yedxpus is xumxpus and ciwypus.\"\n\nBut is yedxpus connected to yupspus? From yupspus, we have yupspus is pajbpus, which is cixmpus, which is jennpus, etc., and we don't see yedxpus in that chain.\n\nPerhaps through another path? What about gelrpus? gelrpus is yedxpus, and saygpus is gelrpus, and gotxpus is saygpus, and dexvpus is gotxpus, and borqpus is dexvpus, and podcpus is borqpus, and fujgpus is podcpus, and ruflpus is fujgpus, and zaqvpus is ruflpus, and toxypus is zaqvpus, and joqspus is toxypus, and pafypus is joqspus, and qujkpus is pafypus, and jefgpus is qujkpus, and yalzpus is jefgpus, and yenlpus is yalzpus, and lukypus is yenlpus, and wudbpus is lukypus, and guvgpus is wudbpus, and xujjpus is guvgpus, and lifzpus is xujjpus, and toplpus is lifzpus, and pemfpus is toplpus, and kerdpus is pemfpus, and biktpus is kerdpus, and pidwpus is biktpus, and gejrpus is pidwpus, and cepcpus is gejrpus, and dajfpus is cepcpus, and relvpus is dajfpus, and bohypus is relvpus, and yecmpus is bohypus, and nutnpus is yecmpus, and rovrpus is nutnpus, and jennpus is rovrpus, and cixmpus is jennpus, and pajbpus is cixmpus, and yupspus is pajbpus.\n\nSo from yedxpus, we have gelrpus, which is connected to saygpus, which is connected to gotxpus, which is connected to dexvpus, which is connected to borqpus, which is connected to podcpus, which is connected to fujgpus, which is connected to ruflpus, which is connected to zaqvpus, which is connected to toxypus, which is connected to joqspus, which is connected to pafypus, which is connected to qujkpus, which is connected to jefgpus, which is connected to yalzpus, which is connected to yenlpus, which is connected to lukypus, which is connected to wudbpus, which is connected to guvgpus, which is connected to xujjpus, which is connected to lifzpus, which is connected to toplpus, which is connected to pemfpus, which is connected to kerdpus, which is connected to biktpus, which is connected to pidwpus, which is connected to gejrpus, which is connected to cepcpus, which is connected to dajfpus, which is connected to relvpus, which is connected to bohypus, which is connected to yecmpus, which is connected to nutnpus, which is connected to rovrpus, which is connected to jennpus, which is connected to cixmpus, which is connected to pajbpus, which is connected to yupspus.\n\nTherefore, yedxpus is connected to yupspus through this long chain.\n\nSince gelrpus is yedxpus and saygpus is gelrpus, etc., eventually to yupspus.\n\nSo, yupspus is connected to yedxpus.\n\nTherefore, since yupspus is connected to yedxpus, and yedxpus is babmpus, then yupspus is babmpus.\n\nBut we already have that yupspus is babgpus and babkpus through yexbpus.\n\nSo, yupspus is babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus.\n\nAnd since x is yupspus, then x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus.\n\nBut wait, x is also gubcpus, but since we have established that yupspus alone is sufficient for all three, and x is yupspus, so x is all three.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any issue with gubcpus. Since x is yupspus and gubcpus, but yupspus already covers all, so even if gubcpus is not connected, it doesn't matter because x is yupspus.\n\nSo, for the question, x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus via yupspus.\n\nThus, the statement is true.",

Let's scan the entire text.\n\nThe text says: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then later it says: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? Actually, upon closer look, I see: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" is given, and then in a different part, it says: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? No, I think I misread.\n\nLet's list all sentences from the given information that mention yexbpus.\n\nFrom the given:\n\n- yexbpus is babgpus.  (this is direct)\n\n- lixjpus is yexbpus and kasnpus.  (so lixjpus contains yexbpus)\n\n- yetmpus is lixjpus.  (so yetmpus contains lixjpus, which contains yexbpus)\n\nBut where is babkpus? I see \"yexbpus is babkpus\" is not directly stated. Instead, I see: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" might be from another part? Wait, no.\n\nI see a line: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\" is not in the text. But in the text, there is: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and also \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" is not directly said.\n\nAnother line: \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" – no, from \"lesbpus is waxqpus and lafzpus\" no mention of yexbpus.\n\nI think I need to find babkpus separately.\n\nLet's look for babkpus. From the text: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" is not stated. But I see: \"yexbpus is babgpus\" and then later \"yexbpus is babkpus\" might be a error? Wait, no.\n\nIn the text, there is a line: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? Let's read the very end of the given information: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\" is not there. But I see: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" is not said.\n\nPerhaps I missed it. Let's read the given information carefully line by line.\n\nThe given information is long, but let's extract only relevant parts for babgpus, babkpus, babmpus.\n\nFirst, babgpus: we have \"yexbpus is babgpus\" so babgpus contains yexbpus or yexbpus is a type of babgpus.\n\nNow for babkpus: I need to find where babkpus is mentioned. From the text: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" is not stated. But I see \"yexbpus is babkpus\" might be from a different context? No.\n\nWait, in the text, there is: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" actually, let's look at the line: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then later, after other things, there is: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? I don't see it.\n\nLet's search for \"babkpus\" in the text. From the text: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" is not present. Instead, I see: \"yexbpus is babgpus\" and then \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" is not there.\n\nBut I see a line: \"yexbpus is babkpus\" is not in the given. What is in the given is: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then much later, \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" is not said. Instead, I have: \"lesbpus is waxqpus and lafzpus\" and also \"yexbpus is lesbpus\" is not stated.\n\nBut from \"lixjpus is yexbpus and kasnpus\" and \"yetmpus is lixjpus\" but that doesn't give babkpus.\n\nPerhaps I misread the question. The question is about x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus.\n\nBut from the given, x is yupspus and gubcpus, so I need to see if yupspus or gubcpus is connected to babgpus, etc.\n\nBut for babkpus, I need to find what babkpus is.\n\nLet's list all occurrences of \"babkpus\" in the given text. Upon careful reading, I see that \"babkpus\" is mentioned only once in the entire text? Let's see.\n\nFrom the given text: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" that's one.\n\nThen later: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\" is not there. But wait, at the very end of the given information, there is a line: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? No, the last few lines are: \"guvgpus is wudbpus.\" so no \"yexbpus is babkpus\".\n\nBut in the beginning, I have \"yexbpus is babgpus\" and that's it.\n\nPerhaps from another part? Let's read the line: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then later \"yexbpus is babkpus\" might be implied? No.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in my reading. Let's look at the given information as provided in the question.\n\nThe user wrote: \"yexbpus is babgpus.\" and then later, after other things, there is: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\"? Let's copy the given text and search for \"babkpus\".\n\nHere is the given text: \"gupppus is kocmpus. lifzpus is xujjpus. zakzpus is borxpus and yuqqpus. kerdpus is pemfpus and hafzpus. yedxpus is xuwfpus. lowdpus is kunmpus and deshpus. mefxpus is lowdpus. yexbpus is babgpus. lofmpus is welgpus and dewqpus. fizjpus is labbpus and selfpus. puwbpus is dovvpus. lukypus is yenlpus. podcpus is borqpus and cayrpus. jennpus is rovrpus and tubtpus and qigwpus. pajbpus is cixmpus. bohypus is relvpus and gofvpus. mimjpus is mefppus. rovrpus is nutnpus and pizhpus. gotxpus is saygpus. wudbpus is lukypus. relvpus is dajfpus and yanlpus. nodnpus is doktpus. nutnpus is yecmpus. pafypus is joqspus. zucnpus is lofmpus. joqspus is toxypus. qujkpus is pafypus and jajppus. motwpus is sinlpus and gadypus. saygpus is gelrpus. toxypus is zaqvpus and mirypus. kintpus is xabjpus and fobmpus. rovrpus is motwpus. cepcpus is gejrpus. pidwpus is biktpus and qomxpus. lesbpus is waxqpus and lafzpus. borqpus is dexvpus. lixjpus is yexbpus and kasnpus. yecmpus is bohypus. gejrpus is pidwpus and yiwwpus. dexvpus is gotxpus and simwpus. yuhtpus is zakzpus. kocmpus is mimjpus and vojhpus. yedxpus is soqmpus and mizzpus. biktpus is messpus. zatxpus is fizjpus and nimppus and mapcpus. x is yupspus and gubcpus. vigspus is lelrpus and lizcpus. kunmpus is vigspus. sinlpus is yerjpus. nubfpus is mefxpus and qikbpus. labbpus is gupppus and xikppus. vabxpus is geqbpus. nutnpus is zaxhpus. tikzpus is yetmpus. yexbpus is babkpus. pemfpus is toplpus and hihcpus. xuwfpus is babmpus. yedxpus is guzcpus and zorspus. biktpus is kerdpus. doktpus is zucnpus. yenlpus is yalzpus. xujjpus is guvgpus. ramlpus is begcpus. pidwpus is vabxpus. messpus is fecxpus. hosvpus is kintpus and zuxgpus. zaqvpus is ruflpus and vuqypus. dovvpus is yuhtpus. yerjpus is kiykpus and locgpus. cuywpus is nodnpus. jefgpus is qujkpus. yetmpus is lixjpus. begcpus is votppus. tikzpus is newppus. yalzpus is jefgpus and xaczpus and tisjpus. yupspus is pajbpus. gelrpus is yedxpus and hovlpus. yedxpus is xumxpus and ciwypus. cixmpus is jennpus. nodnpus is padypus. lifzpus is cuywpus. dajfpus is cepcpus and dojvpus and bilgpus. votppus is hosvpus. lelrpus is zatxpus and yegvpus. yexbpus is lesbpus. toplpus is lifzpus and qivbpus and najjpus. fujgpus is podcpus and ziywpus. xabjpus is nubfpus. mefppus is tikzpus. doktpus is ramlpus and cewhpus. fecxpus is puwbpus and metwpus. ruflpus is fujgpus and fedmpus and remkpus. guvgpus is wudbpus.\"\n\nAh! I missed it. In the text, there is: \"yexbpus is babkpus.\" It is there! Let's see: after \"tikzpus is yetmpus.\" there is \"yexbpus is babkpus.\" So yes, yexbpus is also babkpus.\n\nSimilarly, for babmpus, we have \"xuwfpus is babmpus.\" and from \"yedxpus is xuwfpus\", so yedxpus is xuwfpus, which is babmpus, so yedxpus is babmpus.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- yexbpus is babgpus\n\n- yexbpus is babkpus\n\n- yedxpus is xuwfpus, and xuwfpus is babmpus, so yedxpus is babmpus\n\nNow, the question is about x. x is yupspus and gubcpus.\n\nI need to see if x is connected to yexbpus or yedxpus.\n\nSo, I need to find if yupspus or gubcpus is related to yexbpus or yedxpus.\n\nFirst, let's find what yupspus is. From the text: \"yupspus is pajbpus.\" and \"x is yupspus and gubcpus.\" so yupspus is pajbpus.\n\npajbpus is cixmpus. cixmpus is jennpus. jennpus is rovrpus and tubtpus and qigwpus. rovrpus is nutnpus and pizhpus. Also, rovrpus is motwpus. nutnpus is yecmpus. yecmpus is bohypus. bohypus is relvpus and gofvpus. relvpus is dajfpus and yanlpus. dajfpus is cepcpus and dojvpus and bilgpus. cepcpus is gejrpus. gejrpus is pidwpus and yiwwpus. pidwpus is biktpus and qomxpus. pidwpus is also vabxpus. biktpus is messpus. biktpus is kerdpus. kerdpus is pemfpus and hafzpus. pemfpus is toplpus and hihcpus. toplpus is lifzpus and qivbpus and najjpus. lifzpus is xujjpus. lifzpus is cuywpus. cuywpus is nodnpus. nodnpus is doktpus. nodnpus is padypus. doktpus is zucnpus. doktpus is ramlpus and cewhpus. ramlpus is begcpus. begcpus is votppus. votppus is hosvpus. hosvpus is kintpus and zuxgpus. kintpus is xabjpus and fobmpus. xabjpus is nubfpus. nubfpus is mefxpus and qikbpus. mefxpus is lowdpus. lowdpus is kunmpus and deshpus. kunmpus is vigspus. vigspus is lelrpus and lizcpus. lelrpus is zatxpus and yegvpus. zatxpus is fizjpus and nimppus and mapcpus. fizjpus is labbpus and selfpus. labbpus is gupppus and xikppus. gupppus is kocmpus. kocmpus is mimjpus and vojhpus. mimjpus is mefppus. mefppus is tikzpus. tikzpus is yetmpus. tikzpus is newppus. yetmpus is lixjpus. lixjpus is yexbpus and kasnpus. So finally, through this long chain, we see that yupspus eventually connects to yexbpus.\n\nSince lixjpus is yexbpus, and yetmpus is lixjpus, and tikzpus is yetmpus, and mefppus is tikzpus, and mimjpus is mefppus, and kocmpus is mimjpus, and gupppus is kocmpus, and labbpus is gupppus, and fizjpus is labbpus, and zatxpus is fizjpus, and lelrpus is zatxpus, and vigspus is lelrpus, and kunmpus is vigspus, and lowdpus is kunmpus, and mefxpus is lowdpus, and nubfpus is mefxpus, and xabjpus is nubfpus, and kintpus is xabjpus, and hosvpus is kintpus, and votppus is hosvpus, and begcpus is votppus, and ramlpus is begcpus, and doktpus is ramlpus, and nodnpus is doktpus, and cuywpus is nodnpus, and lifzpus is cuywpus, and toplpus is lifzpus, and pemfpus is toplpus, and kerdpus is pemfpus, and biktpus is kerdpus, and pidwpus is biktpus, and gejrpus is pidwpus, and cepcpus is gejrpus, and dajfpus is cepcpus, and relvpus is dajfpus, and bohypus is relvpus, and yecmpus is bohypus, and nutnpus is yecmpus, and rovrpus is nutnpus, and jennpus is rovrpus, and cixmpus is jennpus, and pajbpus is cixmpus, and yupspus is pajbpus.\n\nSo yupspus is connected to jennpus, which is connected to rovrpus, which is connected to nutnpus, which is connected to yecmpus, which is connected to bohypus, which is connected to relvpus, which is connected to dajfpus, which is connected to cepcpus, which is connected to gejrpus, which is connected to pidwpus, which is connected to biktpus, which is connected to kerdpus, which is connected to pemfpus, which is connected to toplpus, which is connected to lifzpus, which is connected to cuywpus, which is connected to nodnpus, which is connected to doktpus, which is connected to ramlpus, which is connected to begcpus, which is connected to votppus, which is connected to hosvpus, which is connected to kintpus, which is connected to xabjpus, which is connected to nubfpus, which is connected to mefxpus, which is connected to lowdpus, which is connected to kunmpus, which is connected to vigspus, which is connected to lelrpus, which is connected to zatxpus, which is connected to fizjpus, which is connected to labbpus, which is connected to gupppus, which is connected to kocmpus, which is connected to mimjpus, which is connected to mefppus, which is connected to tikzpus, which is connected to yetmpus, which is connected to lixjpus, which is connected to yexbpus.\n\nTherefore, since yupspus is ultimately connected to yexbpus, and yexbpus is babgpus and babkpus, so yupspus is babgpus and babkpus.\n\nBut x is yupspus, so x is yupspus, which is babgpus and babkpus.\n\nNow, we also need x to be babmpus. babmpus is related to yedxpus, since yedxpus is xuwfpus and xuwfpus is babmpus, so yedxpus is babmpus.\n\nSo we need to see if x is connected to yedxpus.\n\nx is yupspus and gubcpus. We have yupspus, but we need to see if yupspus or gubcpus is connected to yedxpus.\n\nFrom above, yupspus is connected to yexbpus, but yexbpus is not directly yedxpus. We need yedxpus.\n\nNow, let's see if gubcpus is connected to yedxpus. But what is gubcpus? From the text, x is gubcpus, but we don't have any other information about gubcpus. Let's check the given information.\n\nThe given information says: \"x is yupspus and gubcpus.\" but there is no other mention of gubcpus. So we don't know what gubcpus is or what it contains. So from the given, we cannot connect gubcpus to anything else.\n\nTherefore, for x to be babmpus, we need either yupspus to be connected to yedxpus or gubcpus to be connected to yedxpus.\n\nBut from the chains, yupspus is connected to yexbpus, but not necessarily to yedxpus.\n\nNow, is there a connection between yexbpus and yedxpus? From the given, yexbpus and yedxpus are different entities, and there is no direct link between them.\n\nLet's see if yupspus is connected to yedxpus through other means.\n\nFrom the chain above, yupspus goes through a long path to yexbpus, but yedxpus is not in that path.\n\nNow, let's look for yedxpus. From the text: \"yedxpus is xuwfpus.\" and \"xuwfpus is babmpus.\" so yedxpus is babmpus.\n\nAlso, \"yedxpus is soqmpus and mizzpus.\" and \"yedxpus is guzcpus and zorspus.\" and \"gelrpus is yedxpus and hovlpus.\" and \"yedxpus is xumxpus and ciwypus.\"\n\nBut is yedxpus connected to yupspus? From yupspus, we have yupspus is pajbpus, which is cixmpus, which is jennpus, etc., and we don't see yedxpus in that chain.\n\nPerhaps through another path? What about gelrpus? gelrpus is yedxpus, and saygpus is gelrpus, and gotxpus is saygpus, and dexvpus is gotxpus, and borqpus is dexvpus, and podcpus is borqpus, and fujgpus is podcpus, and ruflpus is fujgpus, and zaqvpus is ruflpus, and toxypus is zaqvpus, and joqspus is toxypus, and pafypus is joqspus, and qujkpus is pafypus, and jefgpus is qujkpus, and yalzpus is jefgpus, and yenlpus is yalzpus, and lukypus is yenlpus, and wudbpus is lukypus, and guvgpus is wudbpus, and xujjpus is guvgpus, and lifzpus is xujjpus, and toplpus is lifzpus, and pemfpus is toplpus, and kerdpus is pemfpus, and biktpus is kerdpus, and pidwpus is biktpus, and gejrpus is pidwpus, and cepcpus is gejrpus, and dajfpus is cepcpus, and relvpus is dajfpus, and bohypus is relvpus, and yecmpus is bohypus, and nutnpus is yecmpus, and rovrpus is nutnpus, and jennpus is rovrpus, and cixmpus is jennpus, and pajbpus is cixmpus, and yupspus is pajbpus.\n\nSo from yedxpus, we have gelrpus, which is connected to saygpus, which is connected to gotxpus, which is connected to dexvpus, which is connected to borqpus, which is connected to podcpus, which is connected to fujgpus, which is connected to ruflpus, which is connected to zaqvpus, which is connected to toxypus, which is connected to joqspus, which is connected to pafypus, which is connected to qujkpus, which is connected to jefgpus, which is connected to yalzpus, which is connected to yenlpus, which is connected to lukypus, which is connected to wudbpus, which is connected to guvgpus, which is connected to xujjpus, which is connected to lifzpus, which is connected to toplpus, which is connected to pemfpus, which is connected to kerdpus, which is connected to biktpus, which is connected to pidwpus, which is connected to gejrpus, which is connected to cepcpus, which is connected to dajfpus, which is connected to relvpus, which is connected to bohypus, which is connected to yecmpus, which is connected to nutnpus, which is connected to rovrpus, which is connected to jennpus, which is connected to cixmpus, which is connected to pajbpus, which is connected to yupspus.\n\nTherefore, yedxpus is connected to yupspus through this long chain.\n\nSince gelrpus is yedxpus and saygpus is gelrpus, etc., eventually to yupspus.\n\nSo, yupspus is connected to yedxpus.\n\nTherefore, since yupspus is connected to yedxpus, and yedxpus is babmpus, then yupspus is babmpus.\n\nBut we already have that yupspus is babgpus and babkpus through yexbpus.\n\nSo, yupspus is babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus.\n\nAnd since x is yupspus, then x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus.\n\nBut wait, x is also gubcpus, but since we have established that yupspus alone is sufficient for all three, and x is yupspus, so x is all three.\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any issue with gubcpus. Since x is yupspus and gubcpus, but yupspus already covers all, so even if gubcpus is not connected, it doesn't matter because x is yupspus.\n\nSo, for the question, x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus via yupspus.\n\nThus, the statement is true.",

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

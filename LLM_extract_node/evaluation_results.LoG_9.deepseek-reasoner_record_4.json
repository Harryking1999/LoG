  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus. The given information states that x is fazppus. So, I'll start from there and trace through the relationships.\n\nFrom the given: x is fazppus.\n\nNow, I need to find connections from fazppus to babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus.\n\nLet me list out all the relevant statements from the given information. Since it's a chain of belonging, I might need to find paths from fazppus to these categories.\n\nStart with fazppus:\n\n- fazppus is cihgpus (from \"fazppus is cihgpus\")\n\n- cihgpus is vokhpus (from \"cihgpus is vokhpus\")\n\n- vokhpus is sazcpus (from \"vokhpus is sazcpus\")\n\n- sazcpus is juzspus (from \"sazcpus is juzspus\")\n\n- juzspus is soshpus (from \"juzspus is soshpus\")\n\n- soshpus is fixzpus and goyfpus (from \"soshpus is fixzpus and goyfpus\")\n\nBut I need babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus. This path doesn't seem to lead there yet. I might need to look for other connections.\n\nI recall that babbpus is mentioned in relation to rofrpus: \"rofrpus is babbpus\"\n\nAnd rofrpus is connected to wedmpus: \"wedmpus is rofrpus\"\n\nAnd wedmpus is connected to johwpus: \"johwpus is wedmpus and hetwpus\"\n\nBut johwpus is connected to rucdpus: \"rucdpus is johwpus and tatnpus\"\n\nAnd rucdpus is connected to liqhpus: \"liqhpus is rucdpus\" and also \"liqhpus is vaxnpus and xuqdpus\" but from \"liqhpus is roycpus\" as well? Let's see.\n\nFrom \"liqhpus is roycpus\" and \"roycpus is refrpus and yocvpus\"\n\nBut refrpus is xurrpus: \"refrpus is xurrpus\"\n\nxurrpus is tavqpus and koyspus: \"xurrpus is tavqpus and koyspus\"\n\ntavqpus is legtpus and mogmpus: \"tavqpus is legtpus and mogmpus\"\n\nlegtpus is petwpus: \"legtpus is petwpus\"\n\npetwpus is pimjpus: \"petwpus is pimjpus\"\n\npimjpus is faccpus: \"pimjpus is faccpus\"\n\nfaccpus is robdpus and topwpus: \"faccpus is robdpus and topwpus\"\n\nThis seems messy. I need a better way.\n\nI should focus on finding babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus directly.\n\nbabbpus is mentioned only once: \"rofrpus is babbpus\"\n\nSo, to get to babbpus, I need to find if x is rofrpus or something that leads to rofrpus.\n\nSimilarly, babmpus is mentioned: \"vaxnpus is babmpus\" and from \"liqhpus is vaxnpus and xuqdpus\" so babmpus is connected to liqhpus.\n\nAlso, babnpus is mentioned: \"kohnpus is babnpus and vupcpus\" and kohnpus is connected to pivfpus: \"pivfpus is kohnpus\" and pivfpus is connected to jezxpus: \"jezxpus is pivfpus and dezmpus\" and jezxpus is connected to faqtpus: \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" and faqtpus is part of qadxpus: \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus\" but qadxpus is connected to julbpus: \"julbpus is qadxpus\" and julbpus is connected to wezrpus: \"wezrpus is julbpus and koghpus\" and wezrpus is connected to cowspus: \"cowspus is wezrpus and luxrpus\" and cowspus is connected to xuffpus: \"xuffpus is cowspus\" but xuffpus is also connected to sumbpus: \"sumbpus is zuxjpus\" and zuxjpus is xuffpus? Let's see: \"zuxjpus is xuffpus\" so xuffpus is zuxjpus? No, \"zuxjpus is xuffpus\" means zuxjpus belongs to xuffpus, so xuffpus is a category containing zuxjpus.\n\nBut from \"sumbpus is zuxjpus\" so sumbpus contains zuxjpus, which belongs to xuffpus, so sumbpus might be related to xuffpus, but not directly.\n\nThis is getting complicated. I need to organize the information.\n\nLet me list all the categories that x belongs to through fazppus.\n\nx is fazppus.\n\nfazppus is cihgpus.\n\ncihgpus is vokhpus.\n\nvokhpus is sazcpus.\n\nsazcpus is juzspus.\n\njuzspus is soshpus.\n\nsoshpus is fixzpus and goyfpus.\n\nfixzpus is kapqpus. (\"fixzpus is kapqpus\")\n\nkapqpus is balqpus and jonjpus. (\"kapqpus is balqpus and jonjpus\")\n\nbalqpus is vuhdpus and riqrpus. (\"balqpus is vuhdpus and riqrpus\") and also \"balqpus is niwwpus and harnpus\" so balqpus contains niwwpus and harnpus.\n\nniwwpus is pixlpus. (\"niwwpus is pixlpus\")\n\npixlpus is juylpus. (\"pixlpus is juylpus\")\n\njuylpus is cartpus. (\"juylpus is cartpus\")\n\ncartpus is vuqnpus. (\"cartpus is vuqnpus\")\n\nvuqnpus is helspus and wekppus. (\"vuqnpus is helspus and wekppus\")\n\nhelspus is nashpus. (\"helspus is nashpus\") and also \"helspus is yudnpus\" but from \"helspus is nashpus\" and \"nashpus is wazmpus\" so helspus is nashpus which is wazmpus.\n\nwazmpus is nozrpus. (\"wazmpus is nozrpus\")\n\nnozrpus is zihhpus. (\"nozrpus is zihhpus\") and also \"nozrpus is mulbpus\" so nozrpus contains mulbpus.\n\nmulbpus is fajxpus and petbpus. (\"mulbpus is fajxpus and petbpus\")\n\nfajxpus is bixtpus and zugypus and jimlpus and benhpus. (\"fajxpus is bixtpus and zugypus and jimlpus and benhpus\")\n\nbixtpus is dexhpus. (\"bixtpus is dexhpus\")\n\ndexhpus is gelppus and yedhpus. (\"dexhpus is gelppus and yedhpus\")\n\ngelppus is xacypus. (\"gelppus is xacypus\")\n\nxacypus is dunvpus and vismpus and fiyspus. (\"xacypus is dunvpus and vismpus and fiyspus\")\n\ndunvpus is holhpus. (\"dunvpus is holhpus\")\n\nholhpus is farwpus and pubnpus. (\"holhpus is farwpus and pubnpus\")\n\nfarwpus is sahhpus. (\"farwpus is sahhpus\")\n\nsahhpus is zesnpus and geswpus and fawbpus and pehjpus. (\"sahhpus is zesnpus and geswpus and fawbpus and pehjpus\")\n\nzesnpus is qaygpus. (\"zesnpus is qaygpus\")\n\nqaygpus is niblpus and piqtpus. (\"qaygpus is niblpus and piqtpus\")\n\nniblpus is sackpus. (\"niblpus is sackpus\")\n\nsackpus is sogdpus and mufkpus. (\"sackpus is sogdpus and mufkpus\")\n\nsogdpus is heptpus and sasxpus. (\"sogdpus is heptpus and sasxpus\") and also \"sogdpus is nowfpus\" so sogdpus contains nowfpus.\n\nheptpus is qoblpus and zaxlpus. (\"heptpus is qoblpus and zaxlpus\")\n\nThis is going too far from babbpus. I need to stop this path because it doesn't seem to lead to babbpus.\n\nI remember that babbpus is from rofrpus, and rofrpus is from wedmpus, and wedmpus is from johwpus, and johwpus is from rucdpus, and rucdpus is from liqhpus, and liqhpus is from various, but also liqhpus is roycpus, and roycpus is refrpus, and refrpus is xurrpus, and xurrpus is tavqpus, etc.\n\nBut where is x in all this? x is fazppus, and from fazppus, we have cihgpus, vokhpus, sazcpus, juzspus, soshpus, fixzpus, kapqpus, etc., but does this connect to liqhpus or roycpus?\n\nFrom kapqpus, we have balqpus, which has niwwpus, which has pixlpus, which has juylpus, which has cartpus, which has vuqnpus, which has helspus, which has nashpus, which has wazmpus, which has nozrpus, which has mulbpus, which has fajxpus, which has bixtpus, which has dexhpus, which has gelppus, which has xacypus, which has dunvpus, which has holhpus, which has farwpus, which has sahhpus, which has zesnpus, which has qaygpus, which has niblpus, which has sackpus, which has sogdpus, which has nowfpus, but nowfpus is qardpus? \"nowfpus is qardpus\" from \"sogdpus is nowfpus\" and \"nowfpus is qardpus\" so qardpus is nubmpus? \"qardpus is nubmpus\" and \"nubmpus is qovwpus\" and \"qovwpus is fotcpus\" and \"fotcpus is darbpus\" and \"darbpus is bavkpus\" and \"bavkpus is puclpus\" and \"puclpus is momvpus and maydpus\" and \"momvpus is xisnpus\" and \"xisnpus is niqqpus\" and \"niqqpus is vidgpus and jebrpus\" and \"vidgpus is suvhpus\" and \"suvhpus is qelwpus\" and \"qelwpus is bedhpus\" and \"qelwpus is cayypus\" also from \"qelwpus is bedhpus\" and \"bedhpus is mabfpus\" but also \"qelwpus is cayypus\" and \"cayypus is lujppus\" and \"lujppus is tidrpus\" and \"lujppus is zekmpus\" from another statement? \"lujppus is tidrpus\" and \"lujppus is zekmpus\" so lujppus contains both tidrpus and zekmpus? But from \"lujppus is tidrpus\" and \"lujppus is zekmpus\" so tidrpus and zekmpus are both categories under lujppus.\n\nBut from \"zekmpus is letgpus and sapwpus\" and \"letgpus is lurdpus\" and \"lurdpus is rehspus and zekwpus\" and \"rehspus is vivqpus and tumzpus\" and \"vivqpus is sovxpus\" and \"sovxpus is zozkpus\" and \"zozkpus is peblpus and gobspus\" and \"peblpus is wefjpus\" and \"wefjpus is jepbpus\" and \"jepbpus is rabcpus\" and \"rabcpus is bemvpus\" and \"bemvpus is bozlpus\" and \"bozlpus is kirvpus\" and \"kirvpus is tikqpus\" and \"tikqpus is fuzfpus\" and \"fuzfpus is liqhpus and lecqpus and wuzjpus\" so finally, we have liqhpus!\n\nSo from x, through a long chain, we reach liqhpus.\n\nBut liqhpus is also directly mentioned in other places.\n\nFrom fuzfpus is liqhpus, and liqhpus is vaxnpus and xuqdpus, and vaxnpus is babmpus? \"vaxnpus is babmpus\" so if we have liqhpus, and liqhpus contains vaxnpus, then liqhpus is vaxnpus, so vaxnpus is a category under liqhpus, so if something is liqhpus, it is also vaxnpus, and thus babmpus? Let's see the notation: \"liqhpus is vaxnpus and xuqdpus\" means that liqhpus belongs to vaxnpus and xuqdpus? Or does it mean that liqhpus contains vaxnpus and xuqdpus?\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\n\nSo, \"liqhpus is vaxnpus and xuqdpus\" means that liqhpus belongs to both vaxnpus and xuqdpus. So, if something is liqhpus, it is also vaxnpus and xuqdpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"vaxnpus is babmpus\" means that vaxnpus belongs to babmpus, so if something is vaxnpus, it is babmpus.\n\nTherefore, if something is liqhpus, it is vaxnpus, and thus it is babmpus.\n\nSo, from the chain above, if x can be linked to liqhpus, then x is babmpus.\n\nBut from the chain, we have x -> fazppus -> cihgpus -> vokhpus -> sazcpus -> juzspus -> soshpus -> fixzpus -> kapqpus -> balqpus -> niwwpus -> pixlpus -> juylpus -> cartpus -> vuqnpus -> helspus -> nashpus -> wazmpus -> nozrpus -> mulbpus -> fajxpus -> bixtpus -> dexhpus -> gelppus -> xacypus -> dunvpus -> holhpus -> farwpus -> sahhpus -> zesnpus -> qaygpus -> niblpus -> sackpus -> sogdpus -> nowfpus -> qardpus -> nubmpus -> qovwpus -> fotcpus -> darbpus -> bavkpus -> puclpus -> momvpus -> xisnpus -> niqqpus -> vidgpus -> suvhpus -> qelwpus -> cayypus -> lujppus -> zekmpus -> letgpus -> lurdpus -> rehspus -> vivqpus -> sovxpus -> zozkpus -> peblpus -> wefjpus -> jepbpus -> rabcpus -> bemvpus -> bozlpus -> kirvpus -> tikqpus -> fuzfpus -> liqhpus.\n\nThis is a very long chain, but according to the statements, it should be valid. So, x is liqhpus, and since liqhpus is vaxnpus, and vaxnpus is babmpus, therefore x is babmpus.\n\nSo, for babmpus, it is true that x is babmpus.\n\nNow, for babbpus, we need to see if x is babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is from rofrpus: \"rofrpus is babbpus\" so rofrpus belongs to babbpus, so if something is rofrpus, it is babbpus.\n\nNow, is x rofrpus? From the chain, we have liqhpus, and from \"liqhpus is roycpus\" because \"liqhpus is roycpus\" so liqhpus belongs to roycpus.\n\nroycpus is refrpus and yocvpus: \"roycpus is refrpus and yocvpus\" so roycpus belongs to refrpus and yocvpus.\n\nrefrpus is xurrpus: \"refrpus is xurrpus\" so refrpus belongs to xurrpus.\n\nxurrpus is tavqpus and koyspus: \"xurrpus is tavqpus and koyspus\" so xurrpus belongs to tavqpus and koyspus.\n\nBut we need rofrpus. rofrpus is from wedmpus: \"wedmpus is rofrpus\" so wedmpus belongs to rofrpus.\n\nAnd wedmpus is from johwpus: \"johwpus is wedmpus and hetwpus\" so johwpus belongs to wedmpus and hetwpus.\n\nAnd johwpus is from rucdpus: \"rucdpus is johwpus and tatnpus\" so rucdpus belongs to johwpus and tatnpus.\n\nAnd rucdpus is from liqhpus: \"liqhpus is rucdpus\" so liqhpus belongs to rucdpus.\n\nTherefore, since liqhpus belongs to rucdpus, and rucdpus belongs to johwpus, and johwpus belongs to wedmpus, and wedmpus belongs to rofrpus, so liqhpus is rofrpus.\n\nThus, since x is liqhpus, x is rofrpus, and since rofrpus is babbpus, x is babbpus.\n\nSo, for babbpus, it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nNow, for babnpus, we need to see if x is babnpus.\n\nbabnpus is from kohnpus: \"kohnpus is babnpus and vupcpus\" so kohnpus belongs to babnpus and vupcpus.\n\nSo, if something is kohnpus, it is babnpus.\n\nNow, is x kohnpus?\n\nkohnpus is from pivfpus: \"pivfpus is kohnpus\" so pivfpus belongs to kohnpus.\n\npivfpus is from jezxpus: \"jezxpus is pivfpus and dezmpus\" so jezxpus belongs to pivfpus and dezmpus.\n\njezxpus is from faqtpus: \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" so faqtpus belongs to jezxpus.\n\nfaqtpus is from qadxpus: \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus\" so qadxpus belongs to faqtpus and biyfpus.\n\nBut also, faqtpus is from other places? We need to see if x is connected to faqtpus.\n\nFrom earlier, we have x connected to liqhpus, but we need to get to faqtpus.\n\nFrom liqhpus, we have connections, but let's see if there is a shorter path.\n\nFrom the chain that led to liqhpus, we might not have direct connection to faqtpus.\n\nBut from liqhpus, we have that liqhpus is rucdpus, and rucdpus is johwpus, but johwpus is wedmpus and hetwpus, which doesn't directly lead to faqtpus.\n\nAlternatively, from liqhpus, we have that liqhpus is vaxnpus, but vaxnpus is babmpus, not related to kohnpus.\n\nWe need to find another path from x to kohnpus.\n\nFrom x is fazppus, and we went through a long chain to liqhpus, but from liqhpus, we might not have a path to kohnpus.\n\nLet's list the chain from x to liqhpus again quickly: x -> fazppus -> cihgpus -> vokhpus -> sazcpus -> juzspus -> soshpus -> fixzpus -> kapqpus -> balqpus -> niwwpus -> pixlpus -> juylpus -> cartpus -> vuqnpus -> helspus -> nashpus -> wazmpus -> nozrpus -> mulbpus -> fajxpus -> bixtpus -> dexhpus -> gelppus -> xacypus -> dunvpus -> holhpus -> farwpus -> sahhpus -> zesnpus -> qaygpus -> niblpus -> sackpus -> sogdpus -> nowfpus -> qardpus -> nubmpus -> qovwpus -> fotcpus -> darbpus -> bavkpus -> puclpus -> momvpus -> xisnpus -> niqqpus -> vidgpus -> suvhpus -> qelwpus -> cayypus -> lujppus -> zekmpus -> letgpus -> lurdpus -> rehspus -> vivqpus -> sovxpus -> zozkpus -> peblpus -> wefjpus -> jepbpus -> rabcpus -> bemvpus -> bozlpus -> kirvpus -> tikqpus -> fuzfpus -> liqhpus.\n\nNow from liqhpus, we have that liqhpus is roycpus, but that doesn't lead to kohnpus.\n\nliqhpus is also rucdpus, which leads to johwpus, etc., but not to kohnpus.\n\nliqhpus is also vaxnpus and xuqdpus, but vaxnpus is babmpus, not kohnpus.\n\nSo, from this chain, we don't have a connection to kohnpus.\n\nBut perhaps there is another path from x to kohnpus.\n\nRecall that x is fazppus, and fazppus is cihgpus, etc., but we also have other statements.\n\nFor example, from sazcpus is juzspus, but juzspus is soshpus, and soshpus is fixzpus and goyfpus, and fixzpus is kapqpus, which we did, but goyfpus might lead somewhere else? But goyfpus is not mentioned elsewhere, so probably not.\n\nFrom kapqpus, we have balqpus, which has niwwpus, but we already went that way.\n\nAnother path: from vokhpus is sazcpus, but that's it.\n\nPerhaps from cihgpus is vokhpus, but vokhpus is sazcpus, etc.\n\nBut we need to connect to kohnpus.\n\nkohnpus is from pivfpus, and pivfpus is from jezxpus, and jezxpus is from faqtpus.\n\nfaqtpus is from qadxpus, but also faqtpus is from other places? \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" but also \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus\" so faqtpus is a category that contains jezxpus? No, from \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" it means faqtpus belongs to jezxpus? Or does it mean faqtpus contains jezxpus?\n\nLet's read the note: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" means that faqtpus belongs to jezxpus, so jezxpus is a category that contains faqtpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"jezxpus is pivfpus and dezmpus\" means jezxpus belongs to pivfpus and dezmpus, so pivfpus contains jezxpus.\n\nAnd \"pivfpus is kohnpus\" means pivfpus belongs to kohnpus, so kohnpus contains pivfpus.\n\nSo, to have x be kohnpus, we need x to be in the chain that leads to kohnpus.\n\nNow, where is faqtpus mentioned? Also, \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\" from \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\"? Let's see the given: \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\" is not directly stated. From the given: \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus\" so qadxpus belongs to faqtpus and biyfpus, meaning faqtpus contains qadxpus.\n\nAlso, \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" so faqtpus belongs to jezxpus.\n\nBut also, from \"qidnpus is wepvpus and xuftpus and vulspus\" and from \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\"? I think I misread.\n\nLooking back at the given information: \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\" is not stated. Instead, from \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus\" and separately, \"qidnpus is wepvpus and xuftpus and vulspus\" but no direct link between faqtpus and qidnpus.\n\nWait, there is: \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\" – is that in the given? Let's check the given text.\n\nIn the given text: \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus.\" and then \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus.\" – yes, it is there! I missed it.\n\nIn the given: \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus. juylpus is cartpus. x is fazppus. johwpus is wedmpus and hetwpus. sackpus is sogdpus and mufkpus. helspus is nashpus. cartpus is vuqnpus. lurdpus is rehspus and zekwpus. niwwpus is pixlpus. niblpus is sackpus. pilvpus is qovqpus. heptpus is qoblpus and zaxlpus. jezxpus is pivfpus and dezmpus. darbpus is bavkpus. qovqpus is hijtpus and xadspus. bixtpus is dexhpus. xacypus is dunvpus and vismpus and fiyspus. vigqpus is sumbpus. kirvpus is tikqpus. rehspus is vivqpus and tumzpus. legtpus is petwpus. xuffpus is bulbpus. sokgpus is goncpus and haxwpus. cayypus is lujppus. kapqpus is balqpus and jonjpus. suvhpus is qelwpus. cowspus is wezrpus and luxrpus. zekmpus is letgpus and sapwpus. helspus is yudnpus. wazmpus is nozrpus. liqhpus is vaxnpus and xuqdpus. dunvpus is holhpus. goncpus is vigqpus. zuxjpus is xuffpus. nowfpus is qardpus. nozrpus is mulbpus. julbpus is qadxpus. qovwpus is fotcpus. sogdpus is heptpus and sasxpus. sumbpus is zuxjpus. wezrpus is julbpus and koghpus. pivfpus is kohnpus. xuffpus is cowspus. liqhpus is rucdpus. fazppus is cihgpus. tidrpus is pilvpus and kihgpus. balqpus is vuhdpus and riqrpus. qelwpus is bedhpus. lujppus is tidrpus. faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus. zesnpus is qaygpus. fotcpus is darbpus. balqpus is niwwpus and harnpus. kohnpus is babnpus and vupcpus. vuqnpus is helspus and wekppus. vokhpus is sazcpus. wedmpus is rofrpus. roycpus is refrpus and yocvpus. sovxpus is zozkpus. qidnpus is wepvpus and xuftpus and vulspus. farwpus is sahhpus. mulbpus is fajxpus and petbpus. nashpus is wazmpus. sogdpus is nowfpus. zozkpus is peblpus and gobspus. tikqpus is fuzfpus. rucdpus is johwpus and tatnpus. hijtpus is sokgpus. pimjpus is faccpus. juzspus is soshpus. fajxpus is bixtpus and zugypus and jimlpus and benhpus. sahhpus is zesnpus and geswpus and fawbpus and pehjpus. holhpus is farwpus and pubnpus. qelwpus is cayypus. vidgpus is suvhpus. faqtpus is jezxpus. soshpus is fixzpus and goyfpus. bedhpus is mabfpus. rofrpus is babbpus. tavqpus is legtpus and mogmpus. cihgpus is vokhpus. jepbpus is rabcpus. fixzpus is kapqpus. liqhpus is roycpus. vivqpus is sovxpus. pixlpus is juylpus. rabcpus is bemvpus. faccpus is robdpus and topwpus. xisnpus is niqqpus. qardpus is nubmpus. lujppus is zekmpus. puclpus is momvpus and maydpus. xurrpus is tavqpus and koyspus. goncpus is tefxpus and xirrpus. niqqpus is vidgpus and jebrpus. vaxnpus is zaytpus. wefjpus is jepbpus. vaxnpus is babmpus. sazcpus is juzspus. fuzfpus is liqhpus and lecqpus and wuzjpus. nubmpus is qovwpus. bavkpus is puclpus.\"\n\nSo, indeed, \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\" and also \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" so faqtpus belongs to both qidnpus and putwpus, and also to jezxpus.\n\nBut for kohnpus, we need to see if x is connected to faqtpus or jezxpus.\n\nFrom x, we have a chain to liqhpus, but from liqhpus, is there a chain to faqtpus?\n\nliqhpus is connected to roycpus, but roycpus is refrpus and yocvpus, refrpus is xurrpus, xurrpus is tavqpus, etc., which doesn't seem to lead to faqtpus.\n\nliqhpus is also rucdpus, which is johwpus, which is wedmpus, which is rofrpus, which is babbpus, but not faqtpus.\n\nliqhpus is also vaxnpus, which is babmpus, and vaxnpus is zaytpus? \"vaxnpus is zaytpus\" so vaxnpus belongs to zaytpus, but zaytpus is not connected to faqtpus.\n\nSo, from liqhpus, we don't have a path to faqtpus.\n\nBut perhaps from other parts of the chain from x.\n\nFrom x, we went through the long chain to liqhpus, but there might be a shorter path or another branch.\n\nFor example, from lujppus, we have that lujppus is tidrpus and zekmpus. We went through zekmpus to letgpus, etc., but what about tidrpus?\n\n\"lujppus is tidrpus\" so lujppus belongs to tidrpus? Or does it mean that tidrpus contains lujppus? From the notation, \"lujppus is tidrpus\" means lujppus belongs to tidrpus, so tidrpus is a category that contains lujppus.\n\nSimilarly, \"tidrpus is pilvpus and kihgpus\" so tidrpus belongs to pilvpus and kihgpus.\n\nSo, from lujppus, which is from cayypus, etc., we have that lujppus is tidrpus, so x is tidrpus (since x is lujppus through the chain).\n\nThen tidrpus is pilvpus and kihgpus, so x is pilvpus and kihgpus.\n\nNow, pilvpus is qovqpus: \"pilvpus is qovqpus\" so pilvpus belongs to qovqpus.\n\nqovqpus is hijtpus and xadspus: \"qovqpus is hijtpus and xadspus\" so qovqpus belongs to hijtpus and xadspus.\n\nhijtpus is sokgpus: \"hijtpus is sokgpus\" so hijtpus belongs to sokgpus.\n\nsokgpus is goncpus and haxwpus: \"sokgpus is goncpus and haxwpus\" so sokgpus belongs to goncpus and haxwpus.\n\ngoncpus is vigqpus: \"goncpus is vigqpus\" so goncpus belongs to vigqpus.\n\nvigqpus is sumbpus: \"vigqpus is sumbpus\" so vigqpus belongs to sumbpus.\n\nsumbpus is zuxjpus: \"sumbpus is zuxjpus\" so sumbpus belongs to zuxjpus.\n\nzuxjpus is xuffpus: \"zuxjpus is xuffpus\" so zuxjpus belongs to xuffpus.\n\nxuffpus is cowspus: \"xuffpus is cowspus\" so xuffpus belongs to cowspus.\n\ncowspus is wezrpus and luxrpus: \"cowspus is wezrpus and luxrpus\" so cowspus belongs to wezrpus and luxrpus.\n\nwezrpus is julbpus and koghpus: \"wezrpus is julbpus and koghpus\" so wezrpus belongs to julbpus and koghpus.\n\njulbpus is qadxpus: \"julbpus is qadxpus\" so julbpus belongs to qadxpus.\n\nqadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus: \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus\" so qadxpus belongs to faqtpus and biyfpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is qadxpus (through the chain), and qadxpus belongs to faqtpus, so x is faqtpus.\n\nThus, x is faqtpus.\n\nNow, since faqtpus is jezxpus (from \"faqtpus is jezxpus\"), so x is jezxpus.\n\nAnd jezxpus is pivfpus and dezmpus, so x is pivfpus.\n\nAnd pivfpus is kohnpus, so x is kohnpus.\n\nAnd kohnpus is babnpus and vupcpus, so x is babnpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babnpus.\n\nSo, for all three, x is babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus.\n\nThus, the statement is true.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- x is babbpus via liqhpus -> rucdpus -> johwpus -> wedmpus -> rofrpus -> babbpus\n\n- x is babmpus via liqhpus -> vaxnpus -> babmpus\n\n- x is babnpus via lujppus -> tidrpus -> pilvpus -> qovqpus -> hijtpus -> sokgpus -> goncpus -> vigqpus -> sumbpus -> zuxjpus -> xuffpus -> cowspus -> wezrpus -> julbpus -> qadxpus -> faqtpus -> jezxpus -> pivfpus -> kohnpus -> babnpus\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babbpus and babmpus and babnpus.",
  "thinking_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus. The given information states that x is fazppus. So, I'll start from there and trace through the relationships.\n\nFrom the given: x is fazppus.\n\nNow, I need to find connections from fazppus to babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus.\n\nLet me list out all the relevant statements from the given information. Since it's a chain of belonging, I might need to find paths from fazppus to these categories.\n\nStart with fazppus:\n\n- fazppus is cihgpus (from \"fazppus is cihgpus\")\n\n- cihgpus is vokhpus (from \"cihgpus is vokhpus\")\n\n- vokhpus is sazcpus (from \"vokhpus is sazcpus\")\n\n- sazcpus is juzspus (from \"sazcpus is juzspus\")\n\n- juzspus is soshpus (from \"juzspus is soshpus\")\n\n- soshpus is fixzpus and goyfpus (from \"soshpus is fixzpus and goyfpus\")\n\nBut I need babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus. This path doesn't seem to lead there yet. I might need to look for other connections.\n\nI recall that babbpus is mentioned in relation to rofrpus: \"rofrpus is babbpus\"\n\nAnd rofrpus is connected to wedmpus: \"wedmpus is rofrpus\"\n\nAnd wedmpus is connected to johwpus: \"johwpus is wedmpus and hetwpus\"\n\nBut johwpus is connected to rucdpus: \"rucdpus is johwpus and tatnpus\"\n\nAnd rucdpus is connected to liqhpus: \"liqhpus is rucdpus\" and also \"liqhpus is vaxnpus and xuqdpus\" but from \"liqhpus is roycpus\" as well? Let's see.\n\nFrom \"liqhpus is roycpus\" and \"roycpus is refrpus and yocvpus\"\n\nBut refrpus is xurrpus: \"refrpus is xurrpus\"\n\nxurrpus is tavqpus and koyspus: \"xurrpus is tavqpus and koyspus\"\n\ntavqpus is legtpus and mogmpus: \"tavqpus is legtpus and mogmpus\"\n\nlegtpus is petwpus: \"legtpus is petwpus\"\n\npetwpus is pimjpus: \"petwpus is pimjpus\"\n\npimjpus is faccpus: \"pimjpus is faccpus\"\n\nfaccpus is robdpus and topwpus: \"faccpus is robdpus and topwpus\"\n\nThis seems messy. I need a better way.\n\nI should focus on finding babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus directly.\n\nbabbpus is mentioned only once: \"rofrpus is babbpus\"\n\nSo, to get to babbpus, I need to find if x is rofrpus or something that leads to rofrpus.\n\nSimilarly, babmpus is mentioned: \"vaxnpus is babmpus\" and from \"liqhpus is vaxnpus and xuqdpus\" so babmpus is connected to liqhpus.\n\nAlso, babnpus is mentioned: \"kohnpus is babnpus and vupcpus\" and kohnpus is connected to pivfpus: \"pivfpus is kohnpus\" and pivfpus is connected to jezxpus: \"jezxpus is pivfpus and dezmpus\" and jezxpus is connected to faqtpus: \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" and faqtpus is part of qadxpus: \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus\" but qadxpus is connected to julbpus: \"julbpus is qadxpus\" and julbpus is connected to wezrpus: \"wezrpus is julbpus and koghpus\" and wezrpus is connected to cowspus: \"cowspus is wezrpus and luxrpus\" and cowspus is connected to xuffpus: \"xuffpus is cowspus\" but xuffpus is also connected to sumbpus: \"sumbpus is zuxjpus\" and zuxjpus is xuffpus? Let's see: \"zuxjpus is xuffpus\" so xuffpus is zuxjpus? No, \"zuxjpus is xuffpus\" means zuxjpus belongs to xuffpus, so xuffpus is a category containing zuxjpus.\n\nBut from \"sumbpus is zuxjpus\" so sumbpus contains zuxjpus, which belongs to xuffpus, so sumbpus might be related to xuffpus, but not directly.\n\nThis is getting complicated. I need to organize the information.\n\nLet me list all the categories that x belongs to through fazppus.\n\nx is fazppus.\n\nfazppus is cihgpus.\n\ncihgpus is vokhpus.\n\nvokhpus is sazcpus.\n\nsazcpus is juzspus.\n\njuzspus is soshpus.\n\nsoshpus is fixzpus and goyfpus.\n\nfixzpus is kapqpus.

(\"pixlpus is juylpus\")\n\njuylpus is cartpus. (\"juylpus is cartpus\")\n\ncartpus is vuqnpus. (\"cartpus is vuqnpus\")\n\nvuqnpus is helspus and wekppus. (\"vuqnpus is helspus and wekppus\")\n\nhelspus is nashpus. (\"helspus is nashpus\") and also \"helspus is yudnpus\" but from \"helspus is nashpus\" and \"nashpus is wazmpus\" so helspus is nashpus which is wazmpus.\n\nwazmpus is nozrpus. (\"wazmpus is nozrpus\")\n\nnozrpus is zihhpus. (\"nozrpus is zihhpus\") and also \"nozrpus is mulbpus\" so nozrpus contains mulbpus.\n\nmulbpus is fajxpus and petbpus. (\"mulbpus is fajxpus and petbpus\")\n\nfajxpus is bixtpus and zugypus and jimlpus and benhpus. (\"fajxpus is bixtpus and zugypus and jimlpus and benhpus\")\n\nbixtpus is dexhpus.

(\"zesnpus is qaygpus\")\n\nqaygpus is niblpus and piqtpus. (\"qaygpus is niblpus and piqtpus\")\n\nniblpus is sackpus. (\"niblpus is sackpus\")\n\nsackpus is sogdpus and mufkpus. (\"sackpus is sogdpus and mufkpus\")\n\nsogdpus is heptpus and sasxpus. (\"sogdpus is heptpus and sasxpus\") and also \"sogdpus is nowfpus\" so sogdpus contains nowfpus.\n\nheptpus is qoblpus and zaxlpus. (\"heptpus is qoblpus and zaxlpus\")\n\nThis is going too far from babbpus. I need to stop this path because it doesn't seem to lead to babbpus.\n\nI remember that babbpus is from rofrpus, and rofrpus is from wedmpus, and wedmpus is from johwpus, and johwpus is from rucdpus, and rucdpus is from liqhpus, and liqhpus is from various, but also liqhpus is roycpus, and roycpus is refrpus, and refrpus is xurrpus, and xurrpus is tavqpus, etc.\n\nBut where is x in all this? x is fazppus, and from fazppus, we have cihgpus, vokhpus, sazcpus, juzspus, soshpus, fixzpus, kapqpus, etc., but does this connect to liqhpus or roycpus?\n\nFrom kapqpus, we have balqpus, which has niwwpus, which has pixlpus, which has juylpus, which has cartpus, which has vuqnpus, which has helspus, which has nashpus, which has wazmpus, which has nozrpus, which has mulbpus, which has fajxpus, which has bixtpus, which has dexhpus, which has gelppus, which has xacypus, which has dunvpus, which has holhpus, which has farwpus, which has sahhpus, which has zesnpus, which has qaygpus, which has niblpus, which has sackpus, which has sogdpus, which has nowfpus, but nowfpus is qardpus? \"nowfpus is qardpus\" from \"sogdpus is nowfpus\" and \"nowfpus is qardpus\" so qardpus is nubmpus? \"qardpus is nubmpus\" and \"nubmpus is qovwpus\" and \"qovwpus is fotcpus\" and \"fotcpus is darbpus\" and \"darbpus is bavkpus\" and \"bavkpus is puclpus\" and \"puclpus is momvpus and maydpus\" and \"momvpus is xisnpus\" and \"xisnpus is niqqpus\" and \"niqqpus is vidgpus and jebrpus\" and \"vidgpus is suvhpus\" and \"suvhpus is qelwpus\" and \"qelwpus is bedhpus\" and \"qelwpus is cayypus\" also from \"qelwpus is bedhpus\" and \"bedhpus is mabfpus\" but also \"qelwpus is cayypus\" and \"cayypus is lujppus\" and \"lujppus is tidrpus\" and \"lujppus is zekmpus\" from another statement? \"lujppus is tidrpus\" and \"lujppus is zekmpus\" so lujppus contains both tidrpus and zekmpus? But from \"lujppus is tidrpus\" and \"lujppus is zekmpus\" so tidrpus and zekmpus are both categories under lujppus.\n\nBut from \"zekmpus is letgpus and sapwpus\" and \"letgpus is lurdpus\" and \"lurdpus is rehspus and zekwpus\" and \"rehspus is vivqpus and tumzpus\" and \"vivqpus is sovxpus\" and \"sovxpus is zozkpus\" and \"zozkpus is peblpus and gobspus\" and \"peblpus is wefjpus\" and \"wefjpus is jepbpus\" and \"jepbpus is rabcpus\" and \"rabcpus is bemvpus\" and \"bemvpus is bozlpus\" and \"bozlpus is kirvpus\" and \"kirvpus is tikqpus\" and \"tikqpus is fuzfpus\" and \"fuzfpus is liqhpus and lecqpus and wuzjpus\" so finally, we have liqhpus!\n\nSo from x, through a long chain, we reach liqhpus.\n\nBut liqhpus is also directly mentioned in other places.\n\nFrom fuzfpus is liqhpus, and liqhpus is vaxnpus and xuqdpus, and vaxnpus is babmpus? \"vaxnpus is babmpus\" so if we have liqhpus, and liqhpus contains vaxnpus, then liqhpus is vaxnpus, so vaxnpus is a category under liqhpus, so if something is liqhpus, it is also vaxnpus, and thus babmpus? Let's see the notation: \"liqhpus is vaxnpus and xuqdpus\" means that liqhpus belongs to vaxnpus and xuqdpus? Or does it mean that liqhpus contains vaxnpus and xuqdpus?\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\n\nSo, \"liqhpus is vaxnpus and xuqdpus\" means that liqhpus belongs to both vaxnpus and xuqdpus. So, if something is liqhpus, it is also vaxnpus and xuqdpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"vaxnpus is babmpus\" means that vaxnpus belongs to babmpus, so if something is vaxnpus, it is babmpus.\n\nTherefore, if something is liqhpus, it is vaxnpus, and thus it is babmpus.\n\nSo, from the chain above, if x can be linked to liqhpus, then x is babmpus.\n\nBut from the chain, we have x -> fazppus -> cihgpus -> vokhpus -> sazcpus -> juzspus -> soshpus -> fixzpus -> kapqpus -> balqpus -> niwwpus -> pixlpus -> juylpus -> cartpus -> vuqnpus -> helspus -> nashpus -> wazmpus -> nozrpus -> mulbpus -> fajxpus -> bixtpus -> dexhpus -> gelppus -> xacypus -> dunvpus -> holhpus -> farwpus -> sahhpus -> zesnpus -> qaygpus -> niblpus -> sackpus -> sogdpus -> nowfpus -> qardpus -> nubmpus -> qovwpus -> fotcpus -> darbpus -> bavkpus -> puclpus -> momvpus -> xisnpus -> niqqpus -> vidgpus -> suvhpus -> qelwpus -> cayypus -> lujppus -> zekmpus -> letgpus -> lurdpus -> rehspus -> vivqpus -> sovxpus -> zozkpus -> peblpus -> wefjpus -> jepbpus -> rabcpus -> bemvpus -> bozlpus -> kirvpus -> tikqpus -> fuzfpus -> liqhpus.\n\nThis is a very long chain, but according to the statements, it should be valid. So, x is liqhpus, and since liqhpus is vaxnpus, and vaxnpus is babmpus, therefore x is babmpus.\n\nSo, for babmpus, it is true that x is babmpus.\n\nNow, for babbpus, we need to see if x is babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is from rofrpus: \"rofrpus is babbpus\" so rofrpus belongs to babbpus, so if something is rofrpus, it is babbpus.\n\nNow, is x rofrpus? From the chain, we have liqhpus, and from \"liqhpus is roycpus\" because \"liqhpus is roycpus\" so liqhpus belongs to roycpus.\n\nroycpus is refrpus and yocvpus: \"roycpus is refrpus and yocvpus\" so roycpus belongs to refrpus and yocvpus.\n\nrefrpus is xurrpus: \"refrpus is xurrpus\" so refrpus belongs to xurrpus.\n\nxurrpus is tavqpus and koyspus: \"xurrpus is tavqpus and koyspus\" so xurrpus belongs to tavqpus and koyspus.\n\nBut we need rofrpus. rofrpus is from wedmpus: \"wedmpus is rofrpus\" so wedmpus belongs to rofrpus.\n\nAnd wedmpus is from johwpus: \"johwpus is wedmpus and hetwpus\" so johwpus belongs to wedmpus and hetwpus.\n\nAnd johwpus is from rucdpus: \"rucdpus is johwpus and tatnpus\" so rucdpus belongs to johwpus and tatnpus.\n\nAnd rucdpus is from liqhpus: \"liqhpus is rucdpus\" so liqhpus belongs to rucdpus.\n\nTherefore, since liqhpus belongs to rucdpus, and rucdpus belongs to johwpus, and johwpus belongs to wedmpus, and wedmpus belongs to rofrpus, so liqhpus is rofrpus.\n\nThus, since x is liqhpus, x is rofrpus, and since rofrpus is babbpus, x is babbpus.\n\nSo, for babbpus, it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nNow, for babnpus, we need to see if x is babnpus.\n\nbabnpus is from kohnpus: \"kohnpus is babnpus and vupcpus\" so kohnpus belongs to babnpus and vupcpus.\n\nSo, if something is kohnpus, it is babnpus.\n\nNow, is x kohnpus?\n\nkohnpus is from pivfpus: \"pivfpus is kohnpus\" so pivfpus belongs to kohnpus.\n\npivfpus is from jezxpus: \"jezxpus is pivfpus and dezmpus\" so jezxpus belongs to pivfpus and dezmpus.\n\njezxpus is from faqtpus: \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" so faqtpus belongs to jezxpus.\n\nfaqtpus is from qadxpus: \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus\" so qadxpus belongs to faqtpus and biyfpus.\n\nBut also, faqtpus is from other places? We need to see if x is connected to faqtpus.\n\nFrom earlier, we have x connected to liqhpus, but we need to get to faqtpus.\n\nFrom liqhpus, we have connections, but let's see if there is a shorter path.\n\nFrom the chain that led to liqhpus, we might not have direct connection to faqtpus.\n\nBut from liqhpus, we have that liqhpus is rucdpus, and rucdpus is johwpus, but johwpus is wedmpus and hetwpus, which doesn't directly lead to faqtpus.\n\nAlternatively, from liqhpus, we have that liqhpus is vaxnpus, but vaxnpus is babmpus, not related to kohnpus.\n\nWe need to find another path from x to kohnpus.\n\nFrom x is fazppus, and we went through a long chain to liqhpus, but from liqhpus, we might not have a path to kohnpus.\n\nLet's list the chain from x to liqhpus again quickly: x -> fazppus -> cihgpus -> vokhpus -> sazcpus -> juzspus -> soshpus -> fixzpus -> kapqpus -> balqpus -> niwwpus -> pixlpus -> juylpus -> cartpus -> vuqnpus -> helspus -> nashpus -> wazmpus -> nozrpus -> mulbpus -> fajxpus -> bixtpus -> dexhpus -> gelppus -> xacypus -> dunvpus -> holhpus -> farwpus -> sahhpus -> zesnpus -> qaygpus -> niblpus -> sackpus -> sogdpus -> nowfpus -> qardpus -> nubmpus -> qovwpus -> fotcpus -> darbpus -> bavkpus -> puclpus -> momvpus -> xisnpus -> niqqpus -> vidgpus -> suvhpus -> qelwpus -> cayypus -> lujppus -> zekmpus -> letgpus -> lurdpus -> rehspus -> vivqpus -> sovxpus -> zozkpus -> peblpus -> wefjpus -> jepbpus -> rabcpus -> bemvpus -> bozlpus -> kirvpus -> tikqpus -> fuzfpus -> liqhpus.\n\nNow from liqhpus, we have that liqhpus is roycpus, but that doesn't lead to kohnpus.\n\nliqhpus is also rucdpus, which leads to johwpus, etc., but not to kohnpus.\n\nliqhpus is also vaxnpus and xuqdpus, but vaxnpus is babmpus, not kohnpus.\n\nSo, from this chain, we don't have a connection to kohnpus.\n\nBut perhaps there is another path from x to kohnpus.\n\nRecall that x is fazppus, and fazppus is cihgpus, etc., but we also have other statements.\n\nFor example, from sazcpus is juzspus, but juzspus is soshpus, and soshpus is fixzpus and goyfpus, and fixzpus is kapqpus, which we did, but goyfpus might lead somewhere else? But goyfpus is not mentioned elsewhere, so probably not.\n\nFrom kapqpus, we have balqpus, which has niwwpus, but we already went that way.\n\nAnother path: from vokhpus is sazcpus, but that's it.\n\nPerhaps from cihgpus is vokhpus, but vokhpus is sazcpus, etc.\n\nBut we need to connect to kohnpus.\n\nkohnpus is from pivfpus, and pivfpus is from jezxpus, and jezxpus is from faqtpus.\n\nfaqtpus is from qadxpus, but also faqtpus is from other places? \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" but also \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus\" so faqtpus is a category that contains jezxpus? No, from \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" it means faqtpus belongs to jezxpus? Or does it mean faqtpus contains jezxpus?\n\nLet's read the note: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" means that faqtpus belongs to jezxpus, so jezxpus is a category that contains faqtpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"jezxpus is pivfpus and dezmpus\" means jezxpus belongs to pivfpus and dezmpus, so pivfpus contains jezxpus.\n\nAnd \"pivfpus is kohnpus\" means pivfpus belongs to kohnpus, so kohnpus contains pivfpus.\n\nSo, to have x be kohnpus, we need x to be in the chain that leads to kohnpus.\n\nNow, where is faqtpus mentioned? Also, \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\" from \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\"? Let's see the given: \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\" is not directly stated. From the given: \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus\" so qadxpus belongs to faqtpus and biyfpus, meaning faqtpus contains qadxpus.\n\nAlso, \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" so faqtpus belongs to jezxpus.\n\nBut also, from \"qidnpus is wepvpus and xuftpus and vulspus\" and from \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\"? I think I misread.\n\nLooking back at the given information: \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\" is not stated. Instead, from \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus\" and separately, \"qidnpus is wepvpus and xuftpus and vulspus\" but no direct link between faqtpus and qidnpus.\n\nWait, there is: \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\" – is that in the given? Let's check the given text.\n\nIn the given text: \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus.\" and then \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus.\" – yes, it is there! I missed it.\n\nIn the given: \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus. juylpus is cartpus. x is fazppus. johwpus is wedmpus and hetwpus. sackpus is sogdpus and mufkpus. helspus is nashpus. cartpus is vuqnpus. lurdpus is rehspus and zekwpus. niwwpus is pixlpus. niblpus is sackpus. pilvpus is qovqpus. heptpus is qoblpus and zaxlpus. jezxpus is pivfpus and dezmpus. darbpus is bavkpus. qovqpus is hijtpus and xadspus. bixtpus is dexhpus. xacypus is dunvpus and vismpus and fiyspus. vigqpus is sumbpus. kirvpus is tikqpus. rehspus is vivqpus and tumzpus. legtpus is petwpus. xuffpus is bulbpus. sokgpus is goncpus and haxwpus. cayypus is lujppus. kapqpus is balqpus and jonjpus. suvhpus is qelwpus. cowspus is wezrpus and luxrpus. zekmpus is letgpus and sapwpus. helspus is yudnpus. wazmpus is nozrpus. liqhpus is vaxnpus and xuqdpus. dunvpus is holhpus. goncpus is vigqpus. zuxjpus is xuffpus. nowfpus is qardpus. nozrpus is mulbpus. julbpus is qadxpus. qovwpus is fotcpus. sogdpus is heptpus and sasxpus. sumbpus is zuxjpus. wezrpus is julbpus and koghpus. pivfpus is kohnpus. xuffpus is cowspus. liqhpus is rucdpus. fazppus is cihgpus. tidrpus is pilvpus and kihgpus. balqpus is vuhdpus and riqrpus. qelwpus is bedhpus. lujppus is tidrpus. faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus. zesnpus is qaygpus. fotcpus is darbpus. balqpus is niwwpus and harnpus. kohnpus is babnpus and vupcpus. vuqnpus is helspus and wekppus. vokhpus is sazcpus. wedmpus is rofrpus. roycpus is refrpus and yocvpus. sovxpus is zozkpus. qidnpus is wepvpus and xuftpus and vulspus. farwpus is sahhpus. mulbpus is fajxpus and petbpus. nashpus is wazmpus. sogdpus is nowfpus. zozkpus is peblpus and gobspus. tikqpus is fuzfpus. rucdpus is johwpus and tatnpus. hijtpus is sokgpus. pimjpus is faccpus. juzspus is soshpus. fajxpus is bixtpus and zugypus and jimlpus and benhpus. sahhpus is zesnpus and geswpus and fawbpus and pehjpus. holhpus is farwpus and pubnpus. qelwpus is cayypus. vidgpus is suvhpus. faqtpus is jezxpus. soshpus is fixzpus and goyfpus. bedhpus is mabfpus. rofrpus is babbpus. tavqpus is legtpus and mogmpus. cihgpus is vokhpus. jepbpus is rabcpus. fixzpus is kapqpus. liqhpus is roycpus. vivqpus is sovxpus. pixlpus is juylpus. rabcpus is bemvpus. faccpus is robdpus and topwpus. xisnpus is niqqpus. qardpus is nubmpus. lujppus is zekmpus. puclpus is momvpus and maydpus. xurrpus is tavqpus and koyspus. goncpus is tefxpus and xirrpus. niqqpus is vidgpus and jebrpus. vaxnpus is zaytpus. wefjpus is jepbpus. vaxnpus is babmpus. sazcpus is juzspus. fuzfpus is liqhpus and lecqpus and wuzjpus. nubmpus is qovwpus. bavkpus is puclpus.\"\n\nSo, indeed, \"faqtpus is qidnpus and putwpus\" and also \"faqtpus is jezxpus\" so faqtpus belongs to both qidnpus and putwpus, and also to jezxpus.\n\nBut for kohnpus, we need to see if x is connected to faqtpus or jezxpus.\n\nFrom x, we have a chain to liqhpus, but from liqhpus, is there a chain to faqtpus?\n\nliqhpus is connected to roycpus, but roycpus is refrpus and yocvpus, refrpus is xurrpus, xurrpus is tavqpus, etc., which doesn't seem to lead to faqtpus.\n\nliqhpus is also rucdpus, which is johwpus, which is wedmpus, which is rofrpus, which is babbpus, but not faqtpus.\n\nliqhpus is also vaxnpus, which is babmpus, and vaxnpus is zaytpus? \"vaxnpus is zaytpus\" so vaxnpus belongs to zaytpus, but zaytpus is not connected to faqtpus.\n\nSo, from liqhpus, we don't have a path to faqtpus.\n\nBut perhaps from other parts of the chain from x.\n\nFrom x, we went through the long chain to liqhpus, but there might be a shorter path or another branch.\n\nFor example, from lujppus, we have that lujppus is tidrpus and zekmpus. We went through zekmpus to letgpus, etc., but what about tidrpus?\n\n\"lujppus is tidrpus\" so lujppus belongs to tidrpus? Or does it mean that tidrpus contains lujppus? From the notation, \"lujppus is tidrpus\" means lujppus belongs to tidrpus, so tidrpus is a category that contains lujppus.\n\nSimilarly, \"tidrpus is pilvpus and kihgpus\" so tidrpus belongs to pilvpus and kihgpus.\n\nSo, from lujppus, which is from cayypus, etc., we have that lujppus is tidrpus, so x is tidrpus (since x is lujppus through the chain).\n\nThen tidrpus is pilvpus and kihgpus, so x is pilvpus and kihgpus.\n\nNow, pilvpus is qovqpus: \"pilvpus is qovqpus\" so pilvpus belongs to qovqpus.\n\nqovqpus is hijtpus and xadspus: \"qovqpus is hijtpus and xadspus\" so qovqpus belongs to hijtpus and xadspus.\n\nhijtpus is sokgpus: \"hijtpus is sokgpus\" so hijtpus belongs to sokgpus.\n\nsokgpus is goncpus and haxwpus: \"sokgpus is goncpus and haxwpus\" so sokgpus belongs to goncpus and haxwpus.\n\ngoncpus is vigqpus: \"goncpus is vigqpus\" so goncpus belongs to vigqpus.\n\nvigqpus is sumbpus: \"vigqpus is sumbpus\" so vigqpus belongs to sumbpus.\n\nsumbpus is zuxjpus: \"sumbpus is zuxjpus\" so sumbpus belongs to zuxjpus.\n\nzuxjpus is xuffpus: \"zuxjpus is xuffpus\" so zuxjpus belongs to xuffpus.\n\nxuffpus is cowspus: \"xuffpus is cowspus\" so xuffpus belongs to cowspus.\n\ncowspus is wezrpus and luxrpus: \"cowspus is wezrpus and luxrpus\" so cowspus belongs to wezrpus and luxrpus.\n\nwezrpus is julbpus and koghpus: \"wezrpus is julbpus and koghpus\" so wezrpus belongs to julbpus and koghpus.\n\njulbpus is qadxpus: \"julbpus is qadxpus\" so julbpus belongs to qadxpus.\n\nqadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus: \"qadxpus is faqtpus and biyfpus\" so qadxpus belongs to faqtpus and biyfpus.\n\nTherefore, since x is qadxpus (through the chain), and qadxpus belongs to faqtpus, so x is faqtpus.\n\nThus, x is faqtpus.\n\nNow, since faqtpus is jezxpus (from \"faqtpus is jezxpus\"), so x is jezxpus.\n\nAnd jezxpus is pivfpus and dezmpus, so x is pivfpus.\n\nAnd pivfpus is kohnpus, so x is kohnpus.\n\nAnd kohnpus is babnpus and vupcpus, so x is babnpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babnpus.\n\nSo, for all three, x is babbpus, babmpus, and babnpus.\n\nThus, the statement is true.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- x is babbpus via liqhpus -> rucdpus -> johwpus -> wedmpus -> rofrpus -> babbpus\n\n- x is babmpus via liqhpus -> vaxnpus -> babmpus\n\n- x is babnpus via lujppus -> tidrpus -> pilvpus -> qovqpus -> hijtpus -> sokgpus -> goncpus -> vigqpus -> sumbpus -> zuxjpus -> xuffpus -> cowspus -> wezrpus -> julbpus -> qadxpus -> faqtpus -> jezxpus -> pivfpus -> kohnpus -> babnpus\n\nTherefore, it is true that x is babbpus and babmpus and babnpus.",

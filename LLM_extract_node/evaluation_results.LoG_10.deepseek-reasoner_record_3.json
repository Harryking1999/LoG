  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus. From the given information, x is defined as nirnpus.

And then again, gimgpus is babgpus. But since \"is\" means belongs to category, it might be that gimgpus has multiple categories, but I need to see if x is connected to gimgpus.\n\nLet me list out the relevant parts:\n\n- gimgpus is babmpus and giyppus and diqypus.

(from another line)\n\nBut juxnpus is also yegppus, but that might not be relevant.\n\nNow, x is nirnpus, and nirnpus is loghpus and zabvpus. (from the information)\n\nAnd loghpus is xizdpus. (from another line)\n\nxizdpus is bagbpus and qetnpus. (from another line)\n\nbagbpus is zugppus and sozqpus. (from another line)\n\nzugppus is mutcpus. (from another line)\n\nmutcpus is wuhbpus. (from another line)\n\nwuhbpus is cegtpus and mabfpus. (from one line) but also wuhbpus is motspus? Let's see.\n\nFrom information: wuhbpus is cegtpus and mabfpus. And also, mutcpus is wuhbpus. But then later, wuhbpus is motspus? No, let's read carefully.\n\nFrom given: \"mutcpus is wuhbpus.\" and \"wuhbpus is cegtpus and mabfpus.\" but also \"wuhbpus is motspus.\"? No, I think I misread.\n\nLet's look: \"wuhbpus is cegtpus and mabfpus.\" is one statement. Then later, \"wuhbpus is motspus.\" is not directly said. From \"wuhbpus is cegtpus and mabfpus.\" and \"cegtpus is hiybpus.\" etc.\n\nBut there is another line: \"wuhbpus is motspus.\"? Let's check the text.\n\nActually, from the text: \"wuhbpus is cegtpus and mabfpus.\" and then \"wuhbpus is motspus.\" is not present. Instead, I see \"majbpus is gahjpus and vamwpus.\" but that's different.\n\nI think I need to focus on x and gimgpus.\n\nx is nirnpus, and I need to see if nirnpus is babgpus, etc.\n\nBut babgpus, babkpus, babmpus are all categories of gimgpus, as per the statements.\n\nSo, if I can find if nirnpus is gimgpus or connected to gimgpus.\n\nFrom the information, gimgpus is cutcpus? No, cutcpus is gimgpus. \"cutcpus is gimgpus.\" which means cutcpus belongs to gimgpus category.\n\nBut gesmpus is cutcpus, so gesmpus belongs to cutcpus, which belongs to gimgpus.\n\nBut I need to see if nirnpus is gimgpus.\n\nnirnpus is loghpus and zabvpus.\n\nloghpus is xizdpus.\n\nxizdpus is bagbpus and qetnpus.\n\nbagbpus is zugppus and sozqpus.\n\nzugppus is mutcpus.\n\nmutcpus is wuhbpus.\n\nwuhbpus is cegtpus and mabfpus.\n\ncegtpus is hiybpus.\n\nhiybpus is vayvpus.\n\nvayvpus is simvpus.\n\nsimvpus is gaykpus.\n\ngaykpus is tuvfpus.\n\ntuvfpus is qizzpus.\n\nqizzpus is tusjpus and jotlpus.\n\ntusjpus is riglpus and rarmpus.\n\nriglpus is kondpus? From \"riglpus is kondpus.\" but also \"riglpus is parnpus.\" from another line? Let's see.\n\nFrom information: \"riglpus is kondpus.\" and then \"riglpus is parnpus.\"? No, from \"tusjpus is riglpus and rarmpus.\" and then \"riglpus is parnpus.\" is not directly said.\n\nActually, from the list: \"riglpus is kondpus.\" is one statement, and then \"riglpus is parnpus.\" is another? Let's read the given information carefully.\n\nI see: \"riglpus is kondpus.\" and later \"riglpus is parnpus.\"? But in the text, it says: \"riglpus is kondpus.\" and then \"parnpus is buvmpus.\" but not that riglpus is parnpus.\n\nI think I have a mistake. Let's look at the original text.\n\nFrom the given: \"riglpus is kondpus.\" and then later, \"tusjpus is riglpus and rarmpus.\" so tusjpus belongs to riglpus and rarmpus.\n\nBut also, from \"riglpus is parnpus.\"? No, in the text, I don't see \"riglpus is parnpus\". Instead, I see \"parnpus is buvmpus.\" and \"riglpus is parnpus\" is not stated.\n\nLet's read the text: \"riglpus is kondpus.\" is given. Then later, \"tusjpus is riglpus and rarmpus.\" and then \"parnpus is buvmpus.\" but no direct link from riglpus to parnpus.\n\nHowever, in the list, there is: \"tusjpus is riglpus and rarmpus.\" and riglpus is kondpus, so tusjpus is kondpus and rarmpus.\n\nBut for nirnpus, this path seems long and unlikely to lead to gimgpus.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider another path.\n\nFrom nirnpus, it is also zabvpus, but I don't have information on zabvpus, so probably not helpful.\n\nNow, recall that gimgpus is also mentioned in other contexts.\n\nFrom \"cutcpus is gimgpus\" and \"gesmpus is cutcpus\" and \"majbpus is gesmpus and giznpus\" and \"ruvwpus is majbpus\" and \"degmpus is ruvwpus\" and \"cepjpus is degmpus\" and \"qujvpus is cepjpus\" and so on, as I started earlier.\n\nBut this path seems to go through many steps and ends up with yoqjpus or something, which is not directly related to nirnpus.\n\nnirnpus is loghpus, and loghpus is xizdpus, and xizdpus is bagbpus, etc., as above.\n\nBut I need to see if nirnpus is gimgpus.\n\nPerhaps from nirnpus, through loghpus to xizdpus to bagbpus to zugppus to mutcpus to wuhbpus to cegtpus to hiybpus to vayvpus to simvpus to gaykpus to tuvfpus to qizzpus to tusjpus to riglpus to kondpus? But riglpus is kondpus, but kondpus is not mentioned further, or is it?\n\nFrom \"riglpus is kondpus\" but no other information about kondpus, so I don't know what kondpus is.\n\nThen from tusjpus, it is also rarmpus, but no information on rarmpus.\n\nSo this path doesn't lead to gimgpus.\n\nAnother thought: from wuhbpus, it is cegtpus and mabfpus, but mabfpus is not defined, so only cegtpus is useful.\n\ncegtpus is hiybpus, etc., as above.\n\nBut nowhere in this path do I see gimgpus.\n\nSo perhaps nirnpus is not related to gimgpus.\n\nBut I need to check if there is another way.\n\nWhat about zabvpus? nirnpus is zabvpus, but zabvpus is not defined anywhere, so I have no information on zabvpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, I cannot conclude that nirnpus is gimgpus.\n\nSince gimgpus is babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus, if nirnpus is not gimgpus, then it may not be babgpus, etc.\n\nBut I need to see if nirnpus is directly one of them or through other means.\n\nThe question is whether x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus.\n\nSince x is nirnpus, and nirnpus is not directly stated to be any of these, and from the relationships, I don't see a connection, it is likely unknown.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any connection between nirnpus and gimgpus.\n\nFrom the information, there is also \"majbpus is gesmpus and giznpus\" and \"gesmpus is cutcpus\" and \"cutcpus is gimgpus\", so majbpus is related to gimgpus.\n\nBut is nirnpus related to majbpus?\n\nnirnpus is loghpus and zabvpus.\n\nloghpus is xizdpus.\n\nxizdpus is bagbpus and qetnpus.\n\nbagbpus is zugppus and sozqpus.\n\nzugppus is mutcpus.\n\nmutcpus is wuhbpus.\n\nwuhbpus is cegtpus and mabfpus.\n\ncegtpus is hiybpus.\n\nhiybpus is vayvpus.\n\nvayvpus is simvpus.\n\nsimvpus is gaykpus.\n\ngaykpus is tuvfpus.\n\ntuvfpus is qizzpus.\n\nqizzpus is tusjpus and jotlpus.\n\ntusjpus is riglpus and rarmpus.\n\nriglpus is kondpus. — but kondpus is not linked to majbpus.\n\nmajbpus is from other paths.\n\nFor example, majbpus is ruvwpus? From \"ruvwpus is majbpus\" so majbpus is a category of ruvwpus? No, \"ruvwpus is majbpus\" means ruvwpus belongs to majbpus category.\n\nSimilarly, \"degmpus is ruvwpus\" so degmpus belongs to ruvwpus, which belongs to majbpus.\n\nBut from nirnpus, I don't see a path to degmpus or ruvwpus.\n\nFrom another angle, nirnpus is part of the hierarchy that includes wuhbpus, but wuhbpus is cegtpus, which is hiybpus, etc., and not related to majbpus.\n\nmajbpus is also mentioned in \"majbpus is gahjpus and vamwpus\" but gahjpus is bupkpus, etc., which is different.\n\nSo, no connection between nirnpus and majbpus.\n\nTherefore, nirnpus is not related to gimgpus.\n\nThus, since babgpus, babkpus, babmpus are categories of gimgpus, and nirnpus is not gimgpus, it is not necessarily true that nirnpus is babgpus, etc.\n\nIn fact, from the information, we cannot conclude that nirnpus is any of these.\n\nSo, the statement is unknown.\n\nBut let's make sure about the categories. When we say \"gimgpus is babmpus\" it means gimgpus belongs to babmpus, so babmpus is a broader category that contains gimgpus.\n\nSimilarly, for x to be babmpus, x must belong to babmpus, which means x must be gimgpus or something else that belongs to babmpus, but from the information, only gimgpus is stated to be babmpus, so unless x is gimgpus, we don't know.\n\nSimilarly for babkpus and babgpus.\n\nFrom the information, \"gimgpus is babkpus\" and \"gimgpus is babgpus\" so again, only gimgpus is stated to be in these categories.\n\nTherefore, since x is not gimgpus, we cannot say that x is in these categories.\n\nHence, the answer should be unknown.\n\nSo, for the question: Is it true or false or unknown: x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\n\nIt is unknown.",

Let's read the given information carefully.\n\nI see: \"riglpus is kondpus.\" and later \"riglpus is parnpus.\"? But in the text, it says: \"riglpus is kondpus.\" and then \"parnpus is buvmpus.\" but not that riglpus is parnpus.\n\nI think I have a mistake. Let's look at the original text.\n\nFrom the given: \"riglpus is kondpus.\" and then later, \"tusjpus is riglpus and rarmpus.\" so tusjpus belongs to riglpus and rarmpus.\n\nBut also, from \"riglpus is parnpus.\"? No, in the text, I don't see \"riglpus is parnpus\". Instead, I see \"parnpus is buvmpus.\" and \"riglpus is parnpus\" is not stated.\n\nLet's read the text: \"riglpus is kondpus.\" is given. Then later, \"tusjpus is riglpus and rarmpus.\" and then \"parnpus is buvmpus.\" but no direct link from riglpus to parnpus.\n\nHowever, in the list, there is: \"tusjpus is riglpus and rarmpus.\" and riglpus is kondpus, so tusjpus is kondpus and rarmpus.\n\nBut for nirnpus, this path seems long and unlikely to lead to gimgpus.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider another path.\n\nFrom nirnpus, it is also zabvpus, but I don't have information on zabvpus, so probably not helpful.\n\nNow, recall that gimgpus is also mentioned in other contexts.\n\nFrom \"cutcpus is gimgpus\" and \"gesmpus is cutcpus\" and \"majbpus is gesmpus and giznpus\" and \"ruvwpus is majbpus\" and \"degmpus is ruvwpus\" and \"cepjpus is degmpus\" and \"qujvpus is cepjpus\" and so on, as I started earlier.\n\nBut this path seems to go through many steps and ends up with yoqjpus or something, which is not directly related to nirnpus.\n\nnirnpus is loghpus, and loghpus is xizdpus, and xizdpus is bagbpus, etc., as above.\n\nBut I need to see if nirnpus is gimgpus.\n\nPerhaps from nirnpus, through loghpus to xizdpus to bagbpus to zugppus to mutcpus to wuhbpus to cegtpus to hiybpus to vayvpus to simvpus to gaykpus to tuvfpus to qizzpus to tusjpus to riglpus to kondpus? But riglpus is kondpus, but kondpus is not mentioned further, or is it?\n\nFrom \"riglpus is kondpus\" but no other information about kondpus, so I don't know what kondpus is.\n\nThen from tusjpus, it is also rarmpus, but no information on rarmpus.\n\nSo this path doesn't lead to gimgpus.\n\nAnother thought: from wuhbpus, it is cegtpus and mabfpus, but mabfpus is not defined, so only cegtpus is useful.\n\ncegtpus is hiybpus, etc., as above.\n\nBut nowhere in this path do I see gimgpus.\n\nSo perhaps nirnpus is not related to gimgpus.\n\nBut I need to check if there is another way.\n\nWhat about zabvpus? nirnpus is zabvpus, but zabvpus is not defined anywhere, so I have no information on zabvpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, I cannot conclude that nirnpus is gimgpus.\n\nSince gimgpus is babgpus, babkpus, and babmpus, if nirnpus is not gimgpus, then it may not be babgpus, etc.\n\nBut I need to see if nirnpus is directly one of them or through other means.\n\nThe question is whether x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus.\n\nSince x is nirnpus, and nirnpus is not directly stated to be any of these, and from the relationships, I don't see a connection, it is likely unknown.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any connection between nirnpus and gimgpus.\n\nFrom the information, there is also \"majbpus is gesmpus and giznpus\" and \"gesmpus is cutcpus\" and \"cutcpus is gimgpus\", so majbpus is related to gimgpus.\n\nBut is nirnpus related to majbpus?\n\nnirnpus is loghpus and zabvpus.\n\nloghpus is xizdpus.\n\nxizdpus is bagbpus and qetnpus.\n\nbagbpus is zugppus and sozqpus.\n\nzugppus is mutcpus.\n\nmutcpus is wuhbpus.\n\nwuhbpus is cegtpus and mabfpus.\n\ncegtpus is hiybpus.\n\nhiybpus is vayvpus.\n\nvayvpus is simvpus.\n\nsimvpus is gaykpus.\n\ngaykpus is tuvfpus.\n\ntuvfpus is qizzpus.\n\nqizzpus is tusjpus and jotlpus.\n\ntusjpus is riglpus and rarmpus.\n\nriglpus is kondpus. — but kondpus is not linked to majbpus.\n\nmajbpus is from other paths.\n\nFor example, majbpus is ruvwpus? From \"ruvwpus is majbpus\" so majbpus is a category of ruvwpus? No, \"ruvwpus is majbpus\" means ruvwpus belongs to majbpus category.\n\nSimilarly, \"degmpus is ruvwpus\" so degmpus belongs to ruvwpus, which belongs to majbpus.\n\nBut from nirnpus, I don't see a path to degmpus or ruvwpus.\n\nFrom another angle, nirnpus is part of the hierarchy that includes wuhbpus, but wuhbpus is cegtpus, which is hiybpus, etc., and not related to majbpus.\n\nmajbpus is also mentioned in \"majbpus is gahjpus and vamwpus\" but gahjpus is bupkpus, etc., which is different.\n\nSo, no connection between nirnpus and majbpus.\n\nTherefore, nirnpus is not related to gimgpus.\n\nThus, since babgpus, babkpus, babmpus are categories of gimgpus, and nirnpus is not gimgpus, it is not necessarily true that nirnpus is babgpus, etc.\n\nIn fact, from the information, we cannot conclude that nirnpus is any of these.\n\nSo, the statement is unknown.\n\nBut let's make sure about the categories. When we say \"gimgpus is babmpus\" it means gimgpus belongs to babmpus, so babmpus is a broader category that contains gimgpus.\n\nSimilarly, for x to be babmpus, x must belong to babmpus, which means x must be gimgpus or something else that belongs to babmpus, but from the information, only gimgpus is stated to be babmpus, so unless x is gimgpus, we don't know.\n\nSimilarly for babkpus and babgpus.\n\nFrom the information, \"gimgpus is babkpus\" and \"gimgpus is babgpus\" so again, only gimgpus is stated to be in these categories.\n\nTherefore, since x is not gimgpus, we cannot say that x is in these categories.\n\nHence, the answer should be unknown.\n\nSo, for the question: Is it true or false or unknown: x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\n\nIt is unknown.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

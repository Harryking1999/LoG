  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the given information. It's a series of statements about categories, and \"is\" means \"belongs to\" or \"is contained in\". So, for example, \"tecwpus is forypus and qethpus\" means tecwpus is in the category forypus and also in qethpus.\n\nThe question is: Is x babcpus or babrpus or babspus? But looking at the information, I don't see babcpus or babspus mentioned anywhere. Only babrpus is mentioned in \"forypus is babrpus and dagspus\". So, I need to find out if x is in any of these categories.\n\nx is defined as cilfpus: \"x is cilfpus\". So, x is cilfpus.\n\nNow, I need to trace what cilfpus is. From the information: \"cilfpus is watmpus\". And \"watmpus is rengpus and dayvpus and vudlpus\". So, cilfpus is watmpus, which means cilfpus is in watmpus, and since watmpus is in rengpus, dayvpus, and vudlpus, that means cilfpus is also in rengpus, dayvpus, and vudlpus.\n\nNow, rengpus is turjpus: \"rengpus is turjpus\". And turjpus is mumhpus: \"turjpus is mumhpus\". So, rengpus is turjpus, which is mumhpus, so rengpus is in mumhpus.\n\nBut we have cilfpus in rengpus, so cilfpus is in mumhpus indirectly.\n\nNow, mumhpus is xetkpus: \"mumhpus is xetkpus\". And xetkpus is tecwpus and qawhpus: \"xetkpus is tecwpus and qawhpus\". So, mumhpus is in xetkpus, which is in tecwpus and qawhpus.\n\nAlso, tecwpus is forypus and qethpus: \"tecwpus is forypus and qethpus\".\n\nAnd forypus is babrpus and dagspus: \"forypus is babrpus and dagspus\".\n\nSo, if I trace backwards from x: x is cilfpus → cilfpus is watmpus → watmpus is rengpus → rengpus is turjpus → turjpus is mumhpus → mumhpus is xetkpus → xetkpus is tecwpus → tecwpus is forypus → forypus is babrpus.\n\nTherefore, x is in babrpus because forypus is babrpus, and we have a chain from x to forypus.\n\nBut the question is about x being babcpus or babrpus or babspus. We have babrpus, but not babcpus or babspus. From the information, babcpus and babspus are not mentioned at all. So, for babrpus, we can say true, but for the others, we don't know.\n\nThe question is \"x is babcpus or babrpus or babspus?\" which is a logical OR. So, if x is babrpus, then the OR statement is true, even if we don't know about the others.\n\nSo, since x is babrpus, the statement \"x is babcpus or babrpus or babspus\" is true because one of the conditions is true.\n\nBut let me confirm if x is indeed babrpus.\n\nFrom above: x is cilfpus → watmpus → rengpus → turjpus → mumhpus → xetkpus → tecwpus → forypus → babrpus.\n\nYes, so x is in babrpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babrpus, so the OR statement is true.\n\nThe question says \"babcpus or babrpus or babspus\". Since babrpus is true, the whole thing is true.\n\nBut just to be thorough, are there any contradictions or missing links? Let's see all statements:\n\n- tecwpus is forypus and qethpus.\n\n- xetkpus is tecwpus and qawhpus.\n\n- mumhpus is xetkpus.\n\n- cilfpus is watmpus.\n\n- watmpus is rengpus and dayvpus and vudlpus.\n\n- rengpus is turjpus.\n\n- forypus is babrpus and dagspus.\n\n- x is cilfpus.\n\n- turjpus is mumhpus.\n\nSo, all connections are covered.\n\nThus, x is babrpus, so the answer should be true.\n\nThe question is \"is it true or false or unknown?\" Since we know x is babrpus, it is true.\n\nWe don't know about babcpus or babspus, but since babrpus is true, the OR is true.\n\nSo, final answer should be true.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, final answer should be true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

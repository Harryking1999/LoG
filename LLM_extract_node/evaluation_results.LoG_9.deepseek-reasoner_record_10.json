virjpus.\n\nAnd nopcpus is qukypus.\n\nAnd cusgpus is nopcpus.\n\nAnd cirdpus is cusgpus and biczpus and tukdpus.\n\nAnd joskpus is cirdpus.\n\nAnd gimhpus is joskpus.\n\nAnd mermpus is gimhpus and

macrpus.\n\nAnd natlpus is cufjpus and leztpus.\n\nAnd mukkpus is natlpus.\n\nAnd yoxypus is mukkpus and dicjpus.\n\nAnd biyrpus is yoxypus and rithpus.\n\nAnd lakwpus is biyrpus and geslpus.\n\nAnd savjpus is lakwpus.\n\nAnd kolmpus is savjpus and lusqpus.\n\nAnd jomspus is kolmpus and kabjpus.\n\nAnd yeplpus is jomspus.\n\nAnd rixbpus is yeplpus.\n\nAnd bibcpus is rixbpus and mohqpus.\n\nAnd biycpus is bibcpus.\n\nAnd fovwpus is biycpus.\n\nAnd cozppus is fovwpus.\n\nAnd bethpus is cozppus and yochpus and yiyvpus.\n\nAnd mayspus is bethpus.\n\nAnd simqpus is mayspus.\n\nAnd fipwpus is

fethpus.\n\nAnd huvfpus is huwdpus.\n\nAnd zarmpus is huvfpus and naprpus.\n\nAnd lopvpus is zarmpus and fehdpus.\n\nAnd x is lopvpus and fuqkpus.\n\nSo from x, we have x is lopvpus, and lopvpus is zarmpus, etc., but this doesn't directly lead to mokjpus.\n\nWe also have x is mangpus, which we used for babnpus.\n\nBut for mokjpus, we need to see if x is related through other means.\n\nNotice that biqxpus is mokjpus, and biqxpus is related to juzxpus, but juzxpus is geplpus, etc., but x is not directly connected to biqxpus.\n\nFrom x, we have x is lopvpus, which is zarmpus, which is huvfpus, which is huwdpus, which is fethpus, which is nuglpus, which is sekjpus, which is yihbpus, which is pahppus, which is fipwpus, which is simqpus, which is mayspus, which is bethpus, which is cozppus, which is fovwpus, which is biycpus, which is bibcpus, which is rixbpus, which is yeplpus, which is jomspus, which is kolmpus, which is savjpus, which is lakwpus, which is biyrpus, which is yoxypus, which is mukkpus, which is natlpus, which is cufjpus, which is macrpus, which is yenmpus, which is vavdpus, which is zuwrpus, which is viylpus, which is mermpus, which is gimhpus, which is joskpus, which is cirdpus, which is cusgpus, which is nopcpus, which is qukypus, which is geplpus, which is juzxpus, which is biqxpus, which is mokjpus.\n\nSo, indeed, through this long chain, x is connected to mokjpus.\n\nSince x is lopvpus, and through the chain, we reach mokjpus.\n\nTherefore, x is mokjpus? No, not exactly. Because \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if we have a chain where A is B, B is C, etc., then A is also C, but only if the relationships are transitive.\n\nIn this context, since \"is\" means \"belongs to category\", it should be transitive. So if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nSo from above, since x is lopvpus, and lopvpus is zarmpus, and so on, eventually we have biqxpus is mokjpus, but we need x is mokjpus.\n\nFrom the chain: x is lopvpus.\n\nlopvpus is zarmpus → so x is zarmpus\n\nzarmpus is huvfpus and naprpus → so x is huvfpus\n\nhuvfpus is huwdpus → so x is huwdpus\n\nhuwdpus is fethpus → so x is fethpus\n\nfethpus is nuglpus → so x is nuglpus\n\nnuglpus is sekjpus and bibypus → so x is sekjpus\n\nsekjpus is yihbpus → so x is yihbpus\n\nyihbpus is pahppus and tuxvpus → so x is pahppus\n\npahppus is fipwpus and tutvpus → so x is fipwpus\n\nfipwpus is simqpus → so x is simqpus\n\nsimqpus is mayspus → so x is mayspus\n\nmayspus is bethpus → so x is bethpus\n\nbethpus is cozppus and yochpus and yiyvpus → so x is cozppus\n\ncozppus is fovwpus → so x is fovwpus\n\nfovwpus is biycpus → so x is biycpus\n\nbiycpus is bibcpus → so x is bibcpus\n\nbibcpus is rixbpus and mohqpus → so x is rixbpus\n\nrixbpus is yeplpus → so x is yeplpus\n\nyeplpus is jomspus → so x is jomspus\n\njomspus is kolmpus and kabjpus → so x is kolmpus\n\nkolmpus is savjpus and lusqpus → so x is savjpus\n\nsavjpus is lakwpus → so x is lakwpus\n\nlakwpus is biyrpus and geslpus → so x is biyrpus\n\nbiyrpus is yoxypus and rithpus → so x is yoxypus\n\nyoxypus is mukkpus and dicjpus → so x is mukkpus\n\nmukkpus is natlpus → so x is natlpus\n\nnatlpus is cufjpus and leztpus → so x is cufjpus\n\ncufjpus is macrpus → so x is macrpus\n\nmacrpus is yenmpus and tawhpus → so x is yenmpus\n\nyenmpus is vavdpus → so x is vavdpus\n\nvavdpus is zuwrpus and vicdpus → so x is zuwrpus\n\nzuwrpus is viylpus and jarcpus → so x is viylpus\n\nviylpus is mermpus → so x is mermpus\n\nmermpus is gimhpus and mortpus → so x is gimhpus\n\ngimhpus is joskpus → so x is joskpus\n\njoskpus is cirdpus → so x is cirdpus\n\ncirdpus is cusgpus and biczpus and tukdpus → so x is cusgpus\n\ncusgpus is nopcpus → so x is nopcpus\n\nnopcpus is qukypus → so x is qukypus\n\nqukypus is geplpus and virjpus → so x is geplpus\n\ngeplpus is juzxpus → so x is juzxpus\n\njuzxpus is biqxpus → so x is biqxpus\n\nbiqxpus is mokjpus and jivbpus and digxpus → so x is mokjpus\n\nTherefore, x is mokjpus.\n\nSince x is mokjpus, and mokjpus is babbpus and babmpus, so x is babbpus and x is babmpus.\n\nAnd from earlier, we already have x is babnpus.\n\nSo, x is babbpus and babmpus and babnpus.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.",

virjpus.\n\nAnd nopcpus is qukypus.\n\nAnd cusgpus is nopcpus.\n\nAnd cirdpus is cusgpus and biczpus and tukdpus.\n\nAnd joskpus is cirdpus.\n\nAnd gimhpus is joskpus.\n\nAnd mermpus is gimhpus and mortpus.\n\nAnd viylpus is mermpus.\n\nAnd zuwrpus is viylpus and jarcpus.\n\nAnd vavdpus is zuwrpus and vicdpus.\n\nAnd yenmpus is vavdpus.\n\nAnd macrpus is yenmpus and tawhpus.\n\nAnd cufjpus is macrpus.\n\nAnd natlpus is cufjpus and leztpus.\n\nAnd mukkpus is natlpus.\n\nAnd yoxypus is mukkpus and dicjpus.\n\nAnd biyrpus is yoxypus and rithpus.\n\nAnd lakwpus is biyrpus and geslpus.\n\nAnd savjpus is lakwpus.\n\nAnd kolmpus is savjpus and lusqpus.\n\nAnd jomspus is kolmpus and kabjpus.\n\nAnd yeplpus is jomspus.\n\nAnd rixbpus is yeplpus.\n\nAnd bibcpus is rixbpus and mohqpus.\n\nAnd biycpus is bibcpus.\n\nAnd fovwpus is biycpus.\n\nAnd cozppus is fovwpus.\n\nAnd bethpus is cozppus and yochpus and yiyvpus.\n\nAnd mayspus is bethpus.\n\nAnd simqpus is mayspus.\n\nAnd fipwpus is simqpus.\n\nAnd pahppus is fipwpus and tutvpus.\n\nAnd yihbpus is pahppus and tuxvpus.\n\nAnd sekjpus is yihbpus.\n\nAnd nuglpus is sekjpus and bibypus.\n\nAnd fethpus is nuglpus.\n\nAnd huwdpus is fethpus.\n\nAnd huvfpus is huwdpus.\n\nAnd zarmpus is huvfpus and naprpus.\n\nAnd lopvpus is zarmpus and fehdpus.\n\nAnd x is lopvpus and fuqkpus.\n\nSo from x, we have x is lopvpus, and lopvpus is zarmpus, etc., but this doesn't directly lead to mokjpus.\n\nWe also have x is mangpus, which we used for babnpus.\n\nBut for mokjpus, we need to see if x is related through other means.\n\nNotice that biqxpus is mokjpus, and biqxpus is related to juzxpus, but juzxpus is geplpus, etc., but x is not directly connected to biqxpus.\n\nFrom x, we have x is lopvpus, which is zarmpus, which is huvfpus, which is huwdpus, which is fethpus, which is nuglpus, which is sekjpus, which is yihbpus, which is pahppus, which is fipwpus, which is simqpus, which is mayspus, which is bethpus, which is cozppus, which is fovwpus, which is biycpus, which is bibcpus, which is rixbpus, which is yeplpus, which is jomspus, which is kolmpus, which is savjpus, which is lakwpus, which is biyrpus, which is yoxypus, which is mukkpus, which is natlpus, which is cufjpus, which is macrpus, which is yenmpus, which is vavdpus, which is zuwrpus, which is viylpus, which is mermpus, which is gimhpus, which is joskpus, which is cirdpus, which is cusgpus, which is nopcpus, which is qukypus, which is geplpus, which is juzxpus, which is biqxpus, which is mokjpus.\n\nSo, indeed, through this long chain, x is connected to mokjpus.\n\nSince x is lopvpus, and through the chain, we reach mokjpus.\n\nTherefore, x is mokjpus? No, not exactly. Because \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if we have a chain where A is B, B is C, etc., then A is also C, but only if the relationships are transitive.\n\nIn this context, since \"is\" means \"belongs to category\", it should be transitive. So if A is B and B is C, then A is C.\n\nSo from above, since x is lopvpus, and lopvpus is zarmpus, and so on, eventually we have biqxpus is mokjpus, but we need x is mokjpus.\n\nFrom the chain: x is lopvpus.\n\nlopvpus is zarmpus → so x is zarmpus\n\nzarmpus is huvfpus and naprpus → so x is huvfpus\n\nhuvfpus is huwdpus → so x is huwdpus\n\nhuwdpus is fethpus → so x is fethpus\n\nfethpus is nuglpus → so x is nuglpus\n\nnuglpus is sekjpus and bibypus → so x is sekjpus\n\nsekjpus is yihbpus → so x is yihbpus\n\nyihbpus is pahppus and tuxvpus → so x is pahppus\n\npahppus is fipwpus and tutvpus → so x is fipwpus\n\nfipwpus is simqpus → so x is simqpus\n\nsimqpus is mayspus → so x is mayspus\n\nmayspus is bethpus → so x is bethpus\n\nbethpus is cozppus and yochpus and yiyvpus → so x is cozppus\n\ncozppus is fovwpus → so x is fovwpus\n\nfovwpus is biycpus → so x is biycpus\n\nbiycpus is bibcpus → so x is bibcpus\n\nbibcpus is rixbpus and mohqpus → so x is rixbpus\n\nrixbpus is yeplpus → so x is yeplpus\n\nyeplpus is jomspus → so x is jomspus\n\njomspus is kolmpus and kabjpus → so x is kolmpus\n\nkolmpus is savjpus and lusqpus → so x is savjpus\n\nsavjpus is lakwpus → so x is lakwpus\n\nlakwpus is biyrpus and geslpus → so x is biyrpus\n\nbiyrpus is yoxypus and rithpus → so x is yoxypus\n\nyoxypus is mukkpus and dicjpus → so x is mukkpus\n\nmukkpus is natlpus → so x is natlpus\n\nnatlpus is cufjpus and leztpus → so x is cufjpus\n\ncufjpus is macrpus → so x is macrpus\n\nmacrpus is yenmpus and tawhpus → so x is yenmpus\n\nyenmpus is vavdpus → so x is vavdpus\n\nvavdpus is zuwrpus and vicdpus → so x is zuwrpus\n\nzuwrpus is viylpus and jarcpus → so x is viylpus\n\nviylpus is mermpus → so x is mermpus\n\nmermpus is gimhpus and mortpus → so x is gimhpus\n\ngimhpus is joskpus → so x is joskpus\n\njoskpus is cirdpus → so x is cirdpus\n\ncirdpus is cusgpus and biczpus and tukdpus → so x is cusgpus\n\ncusgpus is nopcpus → so x is nopcpus\n\nnopcpus is qukypus → so x is qukypus\n\nqukypus is geplpus and virjpus → so x is geplpus\n\ngeplpus is juzxpus → so x is juzxpus\n\njuzxpus is biqxpus → so x is biqxpus\n\nbiqxpus is mokjpus and jivbpus and digxpus → so x is mokjpus\n\nTherefore, x is mokjpus.\n\nSince x is mokjpus, and mokjpus is babbpus and babmpus, so x is babbpus and x is babmpus.\n\nAnd from earlier, we already have x is babnpus.\n\nSo, x is babbpus and babmpus and babnpus.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.",

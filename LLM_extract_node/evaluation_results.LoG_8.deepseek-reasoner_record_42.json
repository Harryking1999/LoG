  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus. From the given information, x is fedzpus and vitdpus. So, I need to trace what fedzpus is and see if it connects to babbpus.\n\nI see that fedzpus is kibdpus. So x is kibdpus (since x is fedzpus and fedzpus is kibdpus). Then kibdpus is tusypus. So x is tusypus.\n\nNow, tusypus is deshpus. So x is deshpus.\n\ndeshpus is gedjpus and vatjpus and yotbpus. But I need to get to babbpus. I don't see a direct link yet.\n\nI also have that tebppus is dalppus, and dalppus is lohkpus, but that might not help. I need to find where babbpus is mentioned.\n\nFrom the information, luxcpus is babbpus. And tebppus is luxcpus. So tebppus is babbpus.\n\nBut I have x currently at deshpus. How can I connect deshpus to tebppus?\n\nI also have that xinmpus is tebppus and jucgpus. And yujrpus is xinmpus. And vilwpus is yujrpus and fisxpus. And gonppus is vilwpus. And zavfpus is gonppus and qarqpus. And bepxpus is zavfpus. And yovypus is bepxpus and zojgpus. And ruzzpus is yovypus. And qilmpus is ruzzpus and guzypus. And noxnpus is qilmpus and zuwspus. And hejdpus is noxnpus. And koncpus is hejdpus. And kokppus is koncpus and babppus and dajlpus. And tidzpus is kokppus. And conwpus is tidzpus and paskpus. And pedkpus is conwpus. And potppus is pedkpus and pizgpus. And hojcpus is potppus. And koshpus is hojcpus and qiftpus. And daytpus is koshpus and qiyjpus. And govjpus is daytpus. And cajtpus is govjpus. And yosfpus is cajtpus. And joxjpus is yosfpus. And tenmpus is joxjpus. And hedypus is tenmpus and yakwpus. And bochpus is hedypus. And zuwzpus is bochpus and wohwpus. And vorgpus is zuwzpus. And somlpus is vorgpus. And also somlpus is yajhpus. And boscpus is somlpus and fiztpus. And muyhpus is boscpus and qicvpus. And newkpus is muyhpus. And coxzpus is newkpus. And lacnpus is coxzpus and jedcpus. And jezkpus is lacnpus and sewjpus. And mozrpus is jezkpus and gewdpus. Also mozrpus is ladvpus and xogfpus. And pidxpus is mozrpus and jixnpus. And logwpus is pidxpus. And pafmpus is logwpus. And ruxypus is pafmpus. And quxcpus is ruxypus. And lambpus is quxcpus and baqrpus. And goqjpus is lambpus and jaxypus. And mabypus is goqjpus and naknpus. And kajmpus is mabypus. And vewwpus is kajmpus and vuhkpus. And danfpus is vewwpus. And gedjpus is jagfpus and virwpus. And jagfpus is danfpus. So gedjpus is danfpus and virwpus, and since danfpus is vewwpus, gedjpus includes vewwpus.\n\nBut I need deshpus to tebppus. deshpus is gedjpus and vatjpus and yotbpus. gedjpus is jagfpus and virwpus, and jagfpus is danfpus, which is vewwpus, but that doesn't seem to connect to tebppus.\n\nI recall that x is deshpus, and deshpus has gedjpus, which is part of it, but I need another way.\n\nI also have that xinmpus is tebppus, and yujrpus is xinmpus, and vilwpus is yujrpus, etc., but how to connect to deshpus?\n\nPerhaps from deshpus to something else.\n\nI see that tusypus is deshpus, and kibdpus is tusypus, and fedzpus is kibdpus, and x is fedzpus, so x is deshpus.\n\nBut deshpus is given as gedjpus and vatjpus and yotbpus. None of these seem directly related to tebppus.\n\nLet's list all the relationships that involve tebppus.\n\ntebppus is dalppus. But also, xinmpus is tebppus and jucgpus. So tebppus is a category that includes xinmpus? No, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so xinmpus belongs to tebppus? That doesn't make sense because usually, if A is B, B is a broader category.\n\nIn the note, it says \"'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'\", so for example, if xinmpus is tebppus, that means xinmpus is a member of tebppus, so tebppus is a set that contains xinmpus.\n\nSimilarly, if tebppus is luxcpus, then tebppus belongs to luxcpus, so luxcpus contains tebppus.\n\nAnd luxcpus is babbpus, so luxcpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus contains luxcpus.\n\nTherefore, since tebppus is in luxcpus, and luxcpus is in babbpus, then tebppus is in babbpus? But is that transitive?\n\nThe relationship is not necessarily transitive in terms of membership. If A is B and B is C, it doesn't mean A is C, because B might be a member of C, but A is a member of B, so A is not necessarily a member of C unless the categories are nested in a way that membership implies containment.\n\nBut in this context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so B is a category that contains A. So if A is B and B is C, then since B is contained in C, and A is contained in B, then A is contained in C? That would be true if the containment is transitive, which it should be for categories: if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C. But here, \"A is B\" means A is an element of B, not that A is a subset of B.\n\nI think I have a confusion in terminology.\n\nLet's read the note carefully: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \"\n\nThis is ambiguous. Does \"belongs to\" mean is an element of, or is a subset of? In set theory, \"belongs to\" usually means element of, but \"contained in\" might mean subset of.\n\nThe note says \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". So it might mean that A is a member of B, or A is a subset of B. But that doesn't make sense because it's the same relationship for all statements.\n\nPerhaps in this context, \"A is B\" means that A is a type of B, so B is a broader category, and A is a specific instance or a subclass.\n\nBut from the examples, let's see.\n\nFor example, cajtpus is govjpus. joxjpus is yosfpus. etc.\n\nAlso, sometimes multiple things are listed, like kokppus is koncpus and babppus and dajlpus, which suggests that kokppus belongs to multiple categories? Or that kokppus is composed of these? But the note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if A is B and C, it might mean that A belongs to B and also belongs to C.\n\nSimilarly, deshpus is gedjpus and vatjpus and yotbpus, so deshpus belongs to gedjpus, vatjpus, and yotbpus? That would mean that gedjpus is a category that contains deshpus, etc.\n\nBut that seems reversed from how we usually think. Usually, if we say \"A is B\", we mean A is a B, so B is the category.\n\nBut here, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so B is the category, and A is an item in that category.\n\nSo for example, cajtpus is govjpus, so govjpus is a category, and cajtpus is in that category.\n\nSimilarly, govjpus is daytpus, so daytpus is a category, and govjpus is in it.\n\nSo in general, \"A is B\" means that B is a category, and A is a member of B.\n\nNow, if A is B and B is C, does that mean A is C? Not necessarily, because B is a member of C, but A is a member of B, so A may not be a member of C unless C contains all members of B, but since B is a category, it might be that C is a higher-level category that contains B as a member, but not necessarily the members of B.\n\nFor example, if we have \"Apple is Fruit\" and \"Fruit is Food\", then Apple is Food? But in this notation, \"Fruit is Food\" means Fruit belongs to the category Food, so Food contains Fruit, but does it contain Apple? Not directly, but since Apple is a Fruit, and Fruit is in Food, then Apple should be in Food if Food is a category that includes all fruits, but in terms of membership, if Food is a category of categories, then Apple might not be directly in Food.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet's look at the information provided.\n\nI see that hejdpus is noxnpus. And koncpus is hejdpus. So koncpus is hejdpus, and hejdpus is noxnpus, so does that mean koncpus is noxnpus? But from the membership, hejdpus is a member of noxnpus, and koncpus is a member of hejdpus, so koncpus is a member of a member of noxnpus, so koncpus is not necessarily a member of noxnpus.\n\nSimilarly, for my question, I need to know if x is babbpus.\n\nx is fedzpus, fedzpus is kibdpus, kibdpus is tusypus, tusypus is deshpus.\n\nSo x is deshpus.\n\nNow, deshpus is gedjpus and vatjpus and yotbpus, so deshpus is a member of gedjpus, vatjpus, and yotbpus.\n\nBut I need to see if deshpus is babbpus or if it is connected.\n\nbabbpus is mentioned in luxcpus is babbpus, and tebppus is luxcpus, so tebppus is a member of luxcpus, and luxcpus is a member of babbpus, so tebppus is a member of luxcpus, which is a member of babbpus, so tebppus is not necessarily a member of babbpus.\n\nBut from tebppus, we have xinmpus is tebppus and jucgpus, so xinmpus is a member of tebppus.\n\nAnd yujrpus is xinmpus, so yujrpus is a member of xinmpus.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for x to be babbpus, x must be a member of babbpus.\n\nSince x is deshpus, we need deshpus to be a member of babbpus.\n\nBut from the information, is there any chain that shows that deshpus is babbpus?\n\nPerhaps from deshpus, we can go to other categories.\n\ndeshpus is gedjpus, so deshpus is a member of gedjpus.\n\ngedjpus is jagfpus and virwpus, so gedjpus is a member of jagfpus and virwpus.\n\njagfpus is danfpus, so jagfpus is a member of danfpus.\n\ndanfpus is vewwpus, so danfpus is a member of vewwpus.\n\nvewwpus is kajmpus and vuhkpus, so vewwpus is a member of kajmpus and vuhkpus.\n\nkajmpus is mabypus, so kajmpus is a member of mabypus.\n\nmabypus is goqjpus and naknpus, so mabypus is a member of goqjpus and naknpus.\n\ngoqjpus is lambpus and jaxypus, so goqjpus is a member of lambpus and jaxypus.\n\nlambpus is quxcpus and baqrpus, so lambpus is a member of quxcpus and baqrpus.\n\nquxcpus is ruxypus, so quxcpus is a member of ruxypus.\n\nruxypus is pafmpus, so ruxypus is a member of pafmpus.\n\npafmpus is logwpus, so pafmpus is a member of logwpus.\n\nlogwpus is pidxpus, so logwpus is a member of pidxpus.\n\npidxpus is mozrpus and jixnpus, so pidxpus is a member of mozrpus and jixnpus.\n\nmozrpus is jezkpus and gewdpus, and also mozrpus is ladvpus and xogfpus, so mozrpus is a member of jezkpus, gewdpus, ladvpus, and xogfpus.\n\njezkpus is lacnpus and sewjpus, so jezkpus is a member of lacnpus and sewjpus.\n\nlacnpus is coxzpus and jedcpus, so lacnpus is a member of coxzpus and jedcpus.\n\ncoxzpus is newkpus, so coxzpus is a member of newkpus.\n\nnewkpus is muyhpus, so newkpus is a member of muyhpus.\n\nmuyhpus is boscpus and qicvpus, so muyhpus is a member of boscpus and qicvpus.\n\nboscpus is somlpus and fiztpus, so boscpus is a member of somlpus and fiztpus.\n\nsomlpus is vorgpus, and also somlpus is yajhpus, and also somlpus is mowgpus, so somlpus is a member of vorgpus, yajhpus, and mowgpus.\n\nvorgpus is zuwzpus, so vorgpus is a member of zuwzpus.\n\nzuwzpus is bochpus and wohwpus, so zuwzpus is a member of bochpus and wohwpus.\n\nbochpus is hedypus, so bochpus is a member of hedypus.\n\nhedypus is tenmpus and yakwpus, so hedypus is a member of tenmpus and yakwpus.\n\ntenmpus is joxjpus, so tenmpus is a member of joxjpus.\n\njoxjpus is yosfpus, so joxjpus is a member of yosfpus.\n\nyosfpus is qujdpus, so yosfpus is a member of qujdpus? But also yosfpus is cajtpus? Let's see: yosfpus is cajtpus? From the information: \"yosfpus is cajtpus\" but earlier \"joxjpus is yosfpus\" and \"cajtpus is govjpus\" etc.\n\nFrom the given: \"yosfpus is cajtpus\" but also \"cajtpus is govjpus\" so if yosfpus is cajtpus, that means yosfpus is a member of cajtpus, but cajtpus is a member of govjpus, so yosfpus is a member of cajtpus, which is a member of govjpus, so yosfpus is not directly a member of govjpus.\n\nBut also, \"govjpus is daytpus\" etc.\n\nBut this seems messy, and I don't see how this connects to babbpus.\n\nPerhaps I need to find another path from deshpus to babbpus.\n\nFrom deshpus, it is also vatjpus and yotbpus, but there is no information about vatjpus or yotbpus, so that might not help.\n\nAnother thought: from tebppus, we have that xinmpus is tebppus, so xinmpus is a member of tebppus.\n\nBut x is deshpus, so is deshpus related to xinmpus?\n\nFrom the information, we have gedjpus is jagfpus and virwpus, but no direct link to xinmpus.\n\nPerhaps from tusypus or something else.\n\nLet's list all the categories that contain deshpus. Since deshpus is gedjpus and vatjpus and yotbpus, that means that gedjpus contains deshpus, etc., but for x to be babbpus, x must be a member of babbpus, so we need babbpus to contain deshpus.\n\nSo we need to find if babbpus contains deshpus.\n\nFrom the information, babbpus is only mentioned in luxcpus is babbpus, so luxcpus is a member of babbpus, so babbpus contains luxcpus.\n\nBut does babbpus contain deshpus? We need to see if deshpus is in the chain to luxcpus.\n\nluxcpus is related to tebppus, since tebppus is luxcpus, so tebppus is a member of luxcpus.\n\ntebppus is also dalppus, but dalppus is lohkpus, etc.\n\nNow, is there a connection between tebppus and deshpus?\n\nFrom the information, we have that xinmpus is tebppus, so xinmpus is a member of tebppus.\n\nAlso, yujrpus is xinmpus, so yujrpus is a member of xinmpus.\n\nvilwpus is yujrpus and fisxpus, so vilwpus contains yujrpus.\n\ngonppus is vilwpus, so gonppus contains vilwpus.\n\nzavfpus is gonppus and qarqpus, so zavfpus contains gonppus.\n\nbepxpus is zavfpus, so bepxpus contains zavfpus.\n\nyovypus is bepxpus and zojgpus, so yovypus contains bepxpus.\n\nruzzpus is yovypus, so ruzzpus contains yovypus.\n\nqilmpus is ruzzpus and guzypus, so qilmpus contains ruzzpus.\n\nnoxnpus is qilmpus and zuwspus, so noxnpus contains qilmpus.\n\nhejdpus is noxnpus, so hejdpus is a member of noxnpus? No: \"hejdpus is noxnpus\" means hejdpus is a member of noxnpus, so noxnpus contains hejdpus.\n\nBut hejdpus is noxnpus, so hejdpus is in noxnpus.\n\nThen koncpus is hejdpus, so koncpus is in hejdpus.\n\nkokppus is koncpus and babppus and dajlpus, so kokppus is in koncpus, etc.\n\nBut this is going away from deshpus.\n\nPerhaps from deshpus, we have gedjpus, and gedjpus is jagfpus, etc., but as I went earlier, it goes to very far categories.\n\nAnother idea: from deshpus, since it is gedjpus, and gedjpus is jagfpus and virwpus, and jagfpus is danfpus, danfpus is vewwpus, vewwpus is kajmpus and vuhkpus, kajmpus is mabypus, mabypus is goqjpus and naknpus, goqjpus is lambpus and jaxypus, lambpus is quxcpus and baqrpus, quxcpus is ruxypus, ruxypus is pafmpus, pafmpus is logwpus, logwpus is pidxpus, pidxpus is mozrpus and jixnpus, mozrpus is jezkpus and gewdpus, jezkpus is lacnpus and sewjpus, lacnpus is coxzpus and jedcpus, coxzpus is newkpus, newkpus is muyhpus, muyhpus is boscpus and qicvpus, boscpus is somlpus and fiztpus, somlpus is vorgpus, vorgpus is zuwzpus, zuwzpus is bochpus and wohwpus, bochpus is hedypus, hedypus is tenmpus and yakwpus, tenmpus is joxjpus, joxjpus is yosfpus, yosfpus is qujdpus? But also yosfpus is cajtpus? Let's see the information: \"yosfpus is cajtpus\" so yosfpus is a member of cajtpus.\n\nBut also \"joxjpus is yosfpus\" so joxjpus is a member of yosfpus.\n\nAnd \"tenmpus is joxjpus\" so tenmpus is a member of joxjpus.\n\nAnd \"hedypus is tenmpus and yakwpus\" so hedypus is a member of tenmpus and yakwpus.\n\nBut tenmpus is a member of joxjpus, so hedypus is a member of tenmpus, which is a member of joxjpus, so hedypus is indirectly related.\n\nBut this doesn't connect to babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is from luxcpus, and luxcpus is from tebppus, and tebppus is from xinmpus, etc.\n\nxinmpus is from yujrpus, etc.\n\nBut where is deshpus? deshpus is from tusypus, and tusypus is from kibdpus, and kibdpus is from fedzpus, and fedzpus is from x, but that's already x.\n\nPerhaps there is another way.\n\nLet's look at the beginning: \"x is fedzpus and vitdpus\" but vitdpus is not mentioned anywhere else, so probably not helpful.\n\nAlso, \"tebppus is luxcpus\" and \"luxcpus is babbpus\" so for x to be babbpus, x must be a member of babbpus, so either directly or through chain.\n\nBut from x, we have x is fedzpus, fedzpus is kibdpus, kibdpus is tusypus, tusypus is deshpus.\n\nSo x is deshpus.\n\nNow, is deshpus a member of babbpus? From the information, there is no statement that says deshpus is babbpus or anything that leads to babbpus.\n\nPerhaps from deshpus, through other means.\n\ndeshpus is also vatjpus and yotbpus, but no information on them.\n\ndeshpus is gedjpus, and gedjpus is virwpus, but no information on virwpus.\n\nSo it seems that from deshpus, we can go to danfpus and then to vewwpus, etc., but as I traced, it goes to somlpus, which is vorgpus, etc., and eventually to yosfpus, which is cajtpus, but cajtpus is govjpus, govjpus is daytpus, daytpus is koshpus and qiyjpus, koshpus is hojcpus and qiftpus, hojcpus is potppus, potppus is pedkpus and pizgpus, pedkpus is conwpus, conwpus is tidzpus and paskpus, tidzpus is kokppus, kokppus is koncpus and babppus and dajlpus, koncpus is hejdpus, hejdpus is noxnpus, noxnpus is qilmpus and zuwspus, qilmpus is ruzzpus and guzypus, ruzzpus is yovypus, yovypus is bepxpus and zojgpus, bepxpus is zavfpus, zavfpus is gonppus and qarqpus, gonppus is vilwpus, vilwpus is yujrpus and fisxpus, yujrpus is xinmpus, xinmpus is tebppus and jucgpus, tebppus is luxcpus, luxcpus is babbpus.\n\nSo from kokppus, we have koncpus, which is hejdpus, and so on, to tebppus and to babbpus.\n\nBut in this chain, we have kokppus, which is from tidzpus, from conwpus, from pedkpus, from potppus, from hojcpus, from koshpus, from daytpus, from govjpus, from cajtpus, from yosfpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom above, we have daytpus is koshpus and qiyjpus, and govjpus is daytpus, and cajtpus is govjpus, and yosfpus is cajtpus? But from earlier, \"yosfpus is cajtpus\" so yosfpus is a member of cajtpus.\n\nBut in the chain from yosfpus to cajtpus to govjpus to daytpus to koshpus to hojcpus to potppus to pedkpus to conwpus to tidzpus to kokppus to koncpus to hejdpus to noxnpus to qilmpus to ruzzpus to yovypus to bepxpus to zavfpus to gonppus to vilwpus to yujrpus to xinmpus to tebppus to luxcpus to babbpus.\n\nBut this chain starts from yosfpus, but yosfpus is a category that contains joxjpus, since joxjpus is yosfpus, and tenmpus is joxjpus, etc., but we have deshpus which is from gedjpus, which is from jagfpus, which is from danfpus, which is from vewwpus, which is from kajmpus, which is from mabypus, which is from goqjpus, which is from lambpus, which is from quxcpus, which is from ruxypus, which is from pafmpus, which is from logwpus, which is from pidxpus, which is from mozrpus, which is from jezkpus, which is from lacnpus, which is from coxzpus, which is from newkpus, which is from muyhpus, which is from boscpus, which is from somlpus, which is from vorgpus, which is from zuwzpus, which is from bochpus, which is from hedypus, which is from tenmpus, which is from joxjpus, which is from yosfpus.\n\nSo indeed, from deshpus, we can trace to yosfpus through a long chain.\n\nAnd from yosfpus, we can trace to babbpus as above.\n\nTherefore, since deshpus is ultimately contained in yosfpus, and yosfpus is contained in cajtpus, and so on to babbpus, then deshpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nBut is that correct? In terms of membership, if A is B and B is C, does that mean A is C? In this case, since \"is\" means \"is contained in\" or \"belongs to\", it depends on the hierarchy.\n\nFrom the chain, for example, from deshpus to gedjpus to jagfpus to danfpus to vewwpus to kajmpus to mabypus to goqjpus to lambpus to quxcpus to ruxypus to pafmpus to logwpus to pidxpus to mozrpus to jezkpus to lacnpus to coxzpus to newkpus to muyhpus to boscpus to somlpus to vorgpus to zuwzpus to bochpus to hedypus to tenmpus to joxjpus to yosfpus.\n\nSo deshpus is contained in gedjpus, which is contained in jagfpus, and so on, so eventually, deshpus is contained in yosfpus.\n\nThen from yosfpus, yosfpus is contained in cajtpus (since yosfpus is cajtpus).\n\ncajtpus is contained in govjpus (cajtpus is govjpus).\n\ngovjpus is contained in daytpus (govjpus is daytpus).\n\ndaytpus is contained in koshpus and qiyjpus? daytpus is koshpus and qiyjpus, so daytpus is contained in koshpus and also in qiyjpus.\n\nWe need to go to koshpus for the chain to kokppus.\n\nkoshpus is contained in hojcpus and qiftpus? koshpus is hojcpus and qiftpus, so koshpus is contained in hojcpus.\n\nhojcpus is contained in potppus (hojcpus is potppus).\n\npotppus is contained in pedkpus and pizgpus?

  "thinking_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus. From the given information, x is fedzpus and vitdpus. So, I need to trace what fedzpus is and see if it connects to babbpus.\n\nI see that fedzpus is kibdpus. So x is kibdpus (since x is fedzpus and fedzpus is kibdpus). Then kibdpus is tusypus. So x is tusypus.\n\nNow, tusypus is deshpus. So x is deshpus.\n\ndeshpus is gedjpus and vatjpus and yotbpus. But I need to get to babbpus. I don't see a direct link yet.\n\nI also have that tebppus is dalppus, and dalppus is lohkpus, but that might not help. I need to find where babbpus is mentioned.\n\nFrom the information, luxcpus is babbpus. And tebppus is luxcpus. So tebppus is babbpus.\n\nBut I have x currently at deshpus. How can I connect deshpus to tebppus?\n\nI also have that xinmpus is tebppus and jucgpus. And yujrpus is xinmpus. And vilwpus is yujrpus and fisxpus. And gonppus is vilwpus.

And potppus is pedkpus and pizgpus. And hojcpus is potppus. And koshpus is hojcpus and qiftpus. And daytpus is koshpus and qiyjpus. And govjpus is daytpus. And cajtpus is govjpus. And yosfpus is cajtpus. And joxjpus is yosfpus. And tenmpus is joxjpus. And hedypus is tenmpus and yakwpus. And bochpus is hedypus. And zuwzpus is bochpus and wohwpus. And vorgpus is zuwzpus.

So gedjpus is danfpus and virwpus, and since danfpus is vewwpus, gedjpus includes vewwpus.\n\nBut I need deshpus to tebppus. deshpus is gedjpus and vatjpus and yotbpus. gedjpus is jagfpus and virwpus, and jagfpus is danfpus, which is vewwpus, but that doesn't seem to connect to tebppus.\n\nI recall that x is deshpus, and deshpus has gedjpus, which is part of it, but I need another way.\n\nI also have that xinmpus is tebppus, and yujrpus is xinmpus, and vilwpus is yujrpus, etc., but how to connect to deshpus?\n\nPerhaps from deshpus to something else.\n\nI see that tusypus is deshpus, and kibdpus is tusypus, and fedzpus is kibdpus, and x is fedzpus, so x is deshpus.\n\nBut deshpus is given as gedjpus and vatjpus and yotbpus. None of these seem directly related to tebppus.\n\nLet's list all the relationships that involve tebppus.\n\ntebppus is dalppus. But also, xinmpus is tebppus and jucgpus. So tebppus is a category that includes xinmpus? No, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so xinmpus belongs to tebppus? That doesn't make sense because usually, if A is B, B is a broader category.\n\nIn the note, it says \"'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'\", so for example, if xinmpus is tebppus, that means xinmpus is a member of tebppus, so tebppus is a set that contains xinmpus.\n\nSimilarly, if tebppus is luxcpus, then tebppus belongs to luxcpus, so luxcpus contains tebppus.\n\nAnd luxcpus is babbpus, so luxcpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus contains luxcpus.\n\nTherefore, since tebppus is in luxcpus, and luxcpus is in babbpus, then tebppus is in babbpus? But is that transitive?\n\nThe relationship is not necessarily transitive in terms of membership. If A is B and B is C, it doesn't mean A is C, because B might be a member of C, but A is a member of B, so A is not necessarily a member of C unless the categories are nested in a way that membership implies containment.\n\nBut in this context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so B is a category that contains A. So if A is B and B is C, then since B is contained in C, and A is contained in B, then A is contained in C? That would be true if the containment is transitive, which it should be for categories: if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C. But here, \"A is B\" means A is an element of B, not that A is a subset of B.\n\nI think I have a confusion in terminology.\n\nLet's read the note carefully: \" 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B' \"\n\nThis is ambiguous. Does \"belongs to\" mean is an element of, or is a subset of? In set theory, \"belongs to\" usually means element of, but \"contained in\" might mean subset of.\n\nThe note says \"A belongs to category B\" or \"A is contained in B\". So it might mean that A is a member of B, or A is a subset of B. But that doesn't make sense because it's the same relationship for all statements.\n\nPerhaps in this context, \"A is B\" means that A is a type of B, so B is a broader category, and A is a specific instance or a subclass.\n\nBut from the examples, let's see.\n\nFor example, cajtpus is govjpus. joxjpus is yosfpus. etc.\n\nAlso, sometimes multiple things are listed, like kokppus is koncpus and babppus and dajlpus, which suggests that kokppus belongs to multiple categories? Or that kokppus is composed of these? But the note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if A is B and C, it might mean that A belongs to B and also belongs to C.\n\nSimilarly, deshpus is gedjpus and vatjpus and yotbpus, so deshpus belongs to gedjpus, vatjpus, and yotbpus? That would mean that gedjpus is a category that contains deshpus, etc.\n\nBut that seems reversed from how we usually think. Usually, if we say \"A is B\", we mean A is a B, so B is the category.\n\nBut here, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so B is the category, and A is an item in that category.\n\nSo for example, cajtpus is govjpus, so govjpus is a category, and cajtpus is in that category.\n\nSimilarly, govjpus is daytpus, so daytpus is a category, and govjpus is in it.\n\nSo in general, \"A is B\" means that B is a category, and A is a member of B.\n\nNow, if A is B and B is C, does that mean A is C? Not necessarily, because B is a member of C, but A is a member of B, so A may not be a member of C unless C contains all members of B, but since B is a category, it might be that C is a higher-level category that contains B as a member, but not necessarily the members of B.\n\nFor example, if we have \"Apple is Fruit\" and \"Fruit is Food\", then Apple is Food? But in this notation, \"Fruit is Food\" means Fruit belongs to the category Food, so Food contains Fruit, but does it contain Apple? Not directly, but since Apple is a Fruit, and Fruit is in Food, then Apple should be in Food if Food is a category that includes all fruits, but in terms of membership, if Food is a category of categories, then Apple might not be directly in Food.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet's look at the information provided.\n\nI see that hejdpus is noxnpus. And koncpus is hejdpus. So koncpus is hejdpus, and hejdpus is noxnpus, so does that mean koncpus is noxnpus? But from the membership, hejdpus is a member of noxnpus, and koncpus is a member of hejdpus, so koncpus is a member of a member of noxnpus, so koncpus is not necessarily a member of noxnpus.\n\nSimilarly, for my question, I need to know if x is babbpus.\n\nx is fedzpus, fedzpus is kibdpus, kibdpus is tusypus, tusypus is deshpus.\n\nSo x is deshpus.\n\nNow, deshpus is gedjpus and vatjpus and yotbpus, so deshpus is a member of gedjpus, vatjpus, and yotbpus.\n\nBut I need to see if deshpus is babbpus or if it is connected.\n\nbabbpus is mentioned in luxcpus is babbpus, and tebppus is luxcpus, so tebppus is a member of luxcpus, and luxcpus is a member of babbpus, so tebppus is a member of luxcpus, which is a member of babbpus, so tebppus is not necessarily a member of babbpus.\n\nBut from tebppus, we have xinmpus is tebppus and jucgpus, so xinmpus is a member of tebppus.\n\nAnd yujrpus is xinmpus, so yujrpus is a member of xinmpus.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for x to be babbpus, x must be a member of babbpus.\n\nSince x is deshpus, we need deshpus to be a member of babbpus.\n\nBut from the information, is there any chain that shows that deshpus is babbpus?\n\nPerhaps from deshpus, we can go to other categories.\n\ndeshpus is gedjpus, so deshpus is a member of gedjpus.\n\ngedjpus is jagfpus and virwpus, so gedjpus is a member of jagfpus and virwpus.\n\njagfpus is danfpus, so jagfpus is a member of danfpus.\n\ndanfpus is vewwpus, so danfpus is a member of vewwpus.\n\nvewwpus is kajmpus and vuhkpus, so vewwpus is a member of kajmpus and vuhkpus.\n\nkajmpus is mabypus, so kajmpus is a member of mabypus.\n\nmabypus is goqjpus and naknpus, so mabypus is a member of goqjpus and naknpus.\n\ngoqjpus is lambpus and jaxypus, so goqjpus is a member of lambpus and jaxypus.\n\nlambpus is quxcpus and baqrpus, so lambpus is a member of quxcpus and baqrpus.\n\nquxcpus is ruxypus, so quxcpus is a member of ruxypus.\n\nruxypus is pafmpus, so ruxypus is a member of pafmpus.\n\npafmpus is logwpus, so pafmpus is a member of logwpus.\n\nlogwpus is pidxpus, so logwpus is a member of pidxpus.\n\npidxpus is mozrpus and jixnpus, so pidxpus is a member of mozrpus and jixnpus.\n\nmozrpus is jezkpus and gewdpus, and also mozrpus is ladvpus and xogfpus, so mozrpus is a member of jezkpus, gewdpus, ladvpus, and xogfpus.\n\njezkpus is lacnpus and sewjpus, so jezkpus is a member of lacnpus and sewjpus.\n\nlacnpus is coxzpus and jedcpus, so lacnpus is a member of coxzpus and jedcpus.\n\ncoxzpus is newkpus, so coxzpus is a member of newkpus.\n\nnewkpus is muyhpus, so newkpus is a member of muyhpus.\n\nmuyhpus is boscpus and qicvpus, so muyhpus is a member of boscpus and qicvpus.\n\nboscpus is somlpus and fiztpus, so boscpus is a member of somlpus and fiztpus.\n\nsomlpus is vorgpus, and also somlpus is yajhpus, and also somlpus is mowgpus, so somlpus is a member of vorgpus, yajhpus, and mowgpus.\n\nvorgpus is zuwzpus, so vorgpus is a member of zuwzpus.\n\nzuwzpus is bochpus and wohwpus, so zuwzpus is a member of bochpus and wohwpus.\n\nbochpus is hedypus, so bochpus is a member of hedypus.\n\nhedypus is tenmpus and yakwpus, so hedypus is a member of tenmpus and yakwpus.\n\ntenmpus is joxjpus, so tenmpus is a member of joxjpus.\n\njoxjpus is yosfpus, so joxjpus is a member of yosfpus.\n\nyosfpus is qujdpus, so yosfpus is a member of qujdpus? But also yosfpus is cajtpus? Let's see: yosfpus is cajtpus? From the information: \"yosfpus is cajtpus\" but earlier \"joxjpus is yosfpus\" and \"cajtpus is govjpus\" etc.\n\nFrom the given: \"yosfpus is cajtpus\" but also \"cajtpus is govjpus\" so if yosfpus is cajtpus, that means yosfpus is a member of cajtpus, but cajtpus is a member of govjpus, so yosfpus is a member of cajtpus, which is a member of govjpus, so yosfpus is not directly a member of govjpus.\n\nBut also, \"govjpus is daytpus\" etc.\n\nBut this seems messy, and I don't see how this connects to babbpus.\n\nPerhaps I need to find another path from deshpus to babbpus.\n\nFrom deshpus, it is also vatjpus and yotbpus, but there is no information about vatjpus or yotbpus, so that might not help.\n\nAnother thought: from tebppus, we have that xinmpus is tebppus, so xinmpus is a member of tebppus.\n\nBut x is deshpus, so is deshpus related to xinmpus?\n\nFrom the information, we have gedjpus is jagfpus and virwpus, but no direct link to xinmpus.\n\nPerhaps from tusypus or something else.\n\nLet's list all the categories that contain deshpus. Since deshpus is gedjpus and vatjpus and yotbpus, that means that gedjpus contains deshpus, etc., but for x to be babbpus, x must be a member of babbpus, so we need babbpus to contain deshpus.\n\nSo we need to find if babbpus contains deshpus.\n\nFrom the information, babbpus is only mentioned in luxcpus is babbpus, so luxcpus is a member of babbpus, so babbpus contains luxcpus.\n\nBut does babbpus contain deshpus? We need to see if deshpus is in the chain to luxcpus.\n\nluxcpus is related to tebppus, since tebppus is luxcpus, so tebppus is a member of luxcpus.\n\ntebppus is also dalppus, but dalppus is lohkpus, etc.\n\nNow, is there a connection between tebppus and deshpus?\n\nFrom the information, we have that xinmpus is tebppus, so xinmpus is a member of tebppus.\n\nAlso, yujrpus is xinmpus, so yujrpus is a member of xinmpus.\n\nvilwpus is yujrpus and fisxpus, so vilwpus contains yujrpus.\n\ngonppus is vilwpus, so gonppus contains vilwpus.\n\nzavfpus is gonppus and qarqpus, so zavfpus contains gonppus.\n\nbepxpus is zavfpus, so bepxpus contains zavfpus.\n\nyovypus is bepxpus and zojgpus, so yovypus contains bepxpus.\n\nruzzpus is yovypus, so ruzzpus contains yovypus.\n\nqilmpus is ruzzpus and guzypus, so qilmpus contains ruzzpus.\n\nnoxnpus is qilmpus and zuwspus, so noxnpus contains qilmpus.\n\nhejdpus is noxnpus, so hejdpus is a member of noxnpus? No: \"hejdpus is noxnpus\" means hejdpus is a member of noxnpus, so noxnpus contains hejdpus.\n\nBut hejdpus is noxnpus, so hejdpus is in noxnpus.\n\nThen koncpus is hejdpus, so koncpus is in hejdpus.\n\nkokppus is koncpus and babppus and dajlpus, so kokppus is in koncpus, etc.\n\nBut this is going away from deshpus.\n\nPerhaps from deshpus, we have gedjpus, and gedjpus is jagfpus, etc., but as I went earlier, it goes to very far categories.\n\nAnother idea: from deshpus, since it is gedjpus, and gedjpus is jagfpus and virwpus, and jagfpus is danfpus, danfpus is vewwpus, vewwpus is kajmpus and vuhkpus, kajmpus is mabypus, mabypus is goqjpus and naknpus, goqjpus is lambpus and jaxypus, lambpus is quxcpus and baqrpus, quxcpus is ruxypus, ruxypus is pafmpus, pafmpus is logwpus, logwpus is pidxpus, pidxpus is mozrpus and jixnpus, mozrpus is jezkpus and gewdpus, jezkpus is lacnpus and sewjpus, lacnpus is coxzpus and jedcpus, coxzpus is newkpus, newkpus is muyhpus, muyhpus is boscpus and qicvpus, boscpus is somlpus and fiztpus, somlpus is vorgpus, vorgpus is zuwzpus, zuwzpus is bochpus and wohwpus, bochpus is hedypus, hedypus is tenmpus and yakwpus, tenmpus is joxjpus, joxjpus is yosfpus, yosfpus is qujdpus? But also yosfpus is cajtpus? Let's see the information: \"yosfpus is cajtpus\" so yosfpus is a member of cajtpus.\n\nBut also \"joxjpus is yosfpus\" so joxjpus is a member of yosfpus.\n\nAnd \"tenmpus is joxjpus\" so tenmpus is a member of joxjpus.\n\nAnd \"hedypus is tenmpus and yakwpus\" so hedypus is a member of tenmpus and yakwpus.\n\nBut tenmpus is a member of joxjpus, so hedypus is a member of tenmpus, which is a member of joxjpus, so hedypus is indirectly related.\n\nBut this doesn't connect to babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is from luxcpus, and luxcpus is from tebppus, and tebppus is from xinmpus, etc.\n\nxinmpus is from yujrpus, etc.\n\nBut where is deshpus? deshpus is from tusypus, and tusypus is from kibdpus, and kibdpus is from fedzpus, and fedzpus is from x, but that's already x.\n\nPerhaps there is another way.\n\nLet's look at the beginning: \"x is fedzpus and vitdpus\" but vitdpus is not mentioned anywhere else, so probably not helpful.\n\nAlso, \"tebppus is luxcpus\" and \"luxcpus is babbpus\" so for x to be babbpus, x must be a member of babbpus, so either directly or through chain.\n\nBut from x, we have x is fedzpus, fedzpus is kibdpus, kibdpus is tusypus, tusypus is deshpus.\n\nSo x is deshpus.\n\nNow, is deshpus a member of babbpus? From the information, there is no statement that says deshpus is babbpus or anything that leads to babbpus.\n\nPerhaps from deshpus, through other means.\n\ndeshpus is also vatjpus and yotbpus, but no information on them.\n\ndeshpus is gedjpus, and gedjpus is virwpus, but no information on virwpus.\n\nSo it seems that from deshpus, we can go to danfpus and then to vewwpus, etc., but as I traced, it goes to somlpus, which is vorgpus, etc., and eventually to yosfpus, which is cajtpus, but cajtpus is govjpus, govjpus is daytpus, daytpus is koshpus and qiyjpus, koshpus is hojcpus and qiftpus, hojcpus is potppus, potppus is pedkpus and pizgpus, pedkpus is conwpus, conwpus is tidzpus and paskpus, tidzpus is kokppus, kokppus is koncpus and babppus and dajlpus, koncpus is hejdpus, hejdpus is noxnpus, noxnpus is qilmpus and zuwspus, qilmpus is ruzzpus and guzypus, ruzzpus is yovypus, yovypus is bepxpus and zojgpus, bepxpus is zavfpus, zavfpus is gonppus and qarqpus, gonppus is vilwpus, vilwpus is yujrpus and fisxpus, yujrpus is xinmpus, xinmpus is tebppus and jucgpus, tebppus is luxcpus, luxcpus is babbpus.\n\nSo from kokppus, we have koncpus, which is hejdpus, and so on, to tebppus and to babbpus.\n\nBut in this chain, we have kokppus, which is from tidzpus, from conwpus, from pedkpus, from potppus, from hojcpus, from koshpus, from daytpus, from govjpus, from cajtpus, from yosfpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom above, we have daytpus is koshpus and qiyjpus, and govjpus is daytpus, and cajtpus is govjpus, and yosfpus is cajtpus? But from earlier, \"yosfpus is cajtpus\" so yosfpus is a member of cajtpus.\n\nBut in the chain from yosfpus to cajtpus to govjpus to daytpus to koshpus to hojcpus to potppus to pedkpus to conwpus to tidzpus to kokppus to koncpus to hejdpus to noxnpus to qilmpus to ruzzpus to yovypus to bepxpus to zavfpus to gonppus to vilwpus to yujrpus to xinmpus to tebppus to luxcpus to babbpus.\n\nBut this chain starts from yosfpus, but yosfpus is a category that contains joxjpus, since joxjpus is yosfpus, and tenmpus is joxjpus, etc., but we have deshpus which is from gedjpus, which is from jagfpus, which is from danfpus, which is from vewwpus, which is from kajmpus, which is from mabypus, which is from goqjpus, which is from lambpus, which is from quxcpus, which is from ruxypus, which is from pafmpus, which is from logwpus, which is from pidxpus, which is from mozrpus, which is from jezkpus, which is from lacnpus, which is from coxzpus, which is from newkpus, which is from muyhpus, which is from boscpus, which is from somlpus, which is from vorgpus, which is from zuwzpus, which is from bochpus, which is from hedypus, which is from tenmpus, which is from joxjpus, which is from yosfpus.\n\nSo indeed, from deshpus, we can trace to yosfpus through a long chain.\n\nAnd from yosfpus, we can trace to babbpus as above.\n\nTherefore, since deshpus is ultimately contained in yosfpus, and yosfpus is contained in cajtpus, and so on to babbpus, then deshpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nBut is that correct? In terms of membership, if A is B and B is C, does that mean A is C? In this case, since \"is\" means \"is contained in\" or \"belongs to\", it depends on the hierarchy.\n\nFrom the chain, for example, from deshpus to gedjpus to jagfpus to danfpus to vewwpus to kajmpus to mabypus to goqjpus to lambpus to quxcpus to ruxypus to pafmpus to logwpus to pidxpus to mozrpus to jezkpus to lacnpus to coxzpus to newkpus to muyhpus to boscpus to somlpus to vorgpus to zuwzpus to bochpus to hedypus to tenmpus to joxjpus to yosfpus.\n\nSo deshpus is contained in gedjpus, which is contained in jagfpus, and so on, so eventually, deshpus is contained in yosfpus.\n\nThen from yosfpus, yosfpus is contained in cajtpus (since yosfpus is cajtpus).\n\ncajtpus is contained in govjpus (cajtpus is govjpus).\n\ngovjpus is contained in daytpus (govjpus is daytpus).\n\ndaytpus is contained in koshpus and qiyjpus? daytpus is koshpus and qiyjpus, so daytpus is contained in koshpus and also in qiyjpus.\n\nWe need to go to koshpus for the chain to kokppus.\n\nkoshpus is contained in hojcpus and qiftpus? koshpus is hojcpus and qiftpus, so koshpus is contained in hojcpus.\n\nhojcpus is contained in potppus (hojcpus is potppus).\n\npotppus is contained in pedkpus and pizgpus? potppus is pedkpus and pizgpus, so potppus is contained in pedkpus.\n\npedkpus is contained in conwpus (pedkpus is conwpus).\n\nconwpus is contained in tidzpus and paskpus? conwpus is tidzpus and paskpus, so conwpus is contained in tidzpus.\n\ntidzpus is contained in kokppus (tidzpus is kokppus).\n\nkokppus is contained in koncpus and babppus and dajlpus? kokppus is koncpus and babppus and dajlpus, so kokppus is contained in koncpus.\n\nkoncpus is contained in hejdpus (koncpus is hejdpus).\n\nhejdpus is contained in noxnpus (hejdpus is noxnpus).\n\nnoxnpus is contained in qilmpus and zuwspus? noxnpus is qilmpus and zuwspus, so noxnpus is contained in qilmpus.\n\nqilmpus is contained in ruzzpus and guzypus? qilmpus is ruzzpus and guzypus, so qilmpus is contained in ruzzpus.\n\nruzzpus is contained in yovypus (ruzzpus is yovypus).\n\nyovypus is contained in bepxpus and zojgpus? yovypus is bepxpus and zojgpus, so yovypus is contained in bepxpus.\n\nbepxpus is contained in zavfpus (bepxpus is zavfpus).\n\nzavfpus is contained in gonppus and qarqpus? zavfpus is gonppus and qarqpus, so zavfpus is contained in gonppus.\n\ngonppus is contained in vilwpus (gonppus is vilwpus).\n\nvilwpus is contained in yujrpus and fisxpus? vilwpus is yujrpus and fisxpus, so vilwpus is contained in yujrpus.\n\nyujrpus is contained in xinmpus (yujrpus is xinmpus).\n\nxinmpus is contained in tebppus and jucgpus? xinmpus is tebppus and jucgpus, so xinmpus is contained in tebppus.\n\ntebppus is contained in luxcpus (tebppus is luxcpus).\n\nluxcpus is contained in babbpus (luxcpus is babbpus).\n\nTherefore, since deshpus is contained in yosfpus, and yosfpus is contained in cajtpus, and so on, through all these containments, deshpus is ultimately contained in babbpus.\n\nThus, x is deshpus, so x is contained in babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.\n\nBut let's make sure that the chain is correct.\n\nWe have deshpus is gedjpus, so deshpus ⊂ gedjpus\n\ngedjpus is jagfpus and virwpus, so gedjpus ⊂ jagfpus (and also virwpus, but we follow jagfpus for the chain)\n\njagfpus is danfpus, so jagfpus ⊂ danfpus\n\ndanfpus is vewwpus, so danfpus ⊂ vewwpus\n\nvewwpus is kajmpus and vuhkpus, so vewwpus ⊂ kajmpus\n\nkajmpus is mabypus, so kajmpus ⊂ mabypus\n\nmabypus is goqjpus and naknpus, so mabypus ⊂ goqjpus\n\ngoqjpus is lambpus and jaxypus, so goqjpus ⊂ lambpus\n\nlambpus is quxcpus and baqrpus, so lambpus ⊂ quxcpus\n\nquxcpus is ruxypus, so quxcpus ⊂ ruxypus\n\nruxypus is pafmpus, so ruxypus ⊂ pafmpus\n\npafmpus is logwpus, so pafmpus ⊂ logwpus\n\nlogwpus is pidxpus, so logwpus ⊂ pidxpus\n\npidxpus is mozrpus and jixnpus, so pidxpus ⊂ mozrpus\n\nmozrpus is jezkpus and gewdpus, so mozrpus ⊂ jezkpus\n\njezkpus is lacnpus and sewjpus, so jezkpus ⊂ lacnpus\n\nlacnpus is coxzpus and jedcpus, so lacnpus ⊂ coxzpus\n\ncoxzpus is newkpus, so coxzpus ⊂ newkpus\n\nnewkpus is muyhpus, so newkpus ⊂ muyhpus\n\nmuyhpus is boscpus and qicvpus, so muyhpus ⊂ boscpus\n\nboscpus is somlpus and fiztpus, so boscpus ⊂ somlpus\n\nsomlpus is vorgpus, so somlpus ⊂ vorgpus\n\nvorgpus is zuwzpus, so vorgpus ⊂ zuwzpus\n\nzuwzpus is bochpus and wohwpus, so zuwzpus ⊂ bochpus\n\nbochpus is hedypus, so bochpus ⊂ hedypus\n\nhedypus is tenmpus and yakwpus, so hedypus ⊂ tenmpus\n\ntenmpus is joxjpus, so tenmpus ⊂ joxjpus\n\njoxjpus is yosfpus, so joxjpus ⊂ yosfpus\n\nNow, from yosfpus, we have yosfpus is cajtpus, so yosfpus ⊂ cajtpus\n\ncajtpus is govjpus, so cajtpus ⊂ govjpus\n\ngovjpus is daytpus, so govjpus ⊂ daytpus\n\ndaytpus is koshpus and qiyjpus, so daytpus ⊂ koshpus\n\nkoshpus is hojcpus and qiftpus, so koshpus ⊂ hojcpus\n\nhojcpus is potppus, so hojcpus ⊂ potppus\n\npotppus is pedkpus and pizgpus, so potppus ⊂ pedkpus\n\npedkpus is conwpus, so pedkpus ⊂ conwpus\n\nconwpus is tidzpus and paskpus, so conwpus ⊂ tidzpus\n\ntidzpus is kokppus, so tidzpus ⊂ kokppus\n\nkokppus is koncpus and babppus and dajlpus, so kokppus ⊂ koncpus\n\nkoncpus is hejdpus, so koncpus ⊂ hejdpus\n\nhejdpus is noxnpus, so hejdpus ⊂ noxnpus\n\nnoxnpus is qilmpus and zuwspus, so noxnpus ⊂ qilmpus\n\nqilmpus is ruzzpus and guzypus, so qilmpus ⊂ ruzzpus\n\nruzzpus is yovypus, so ruzzpus ⊂ yovypus\n\nyovypus is bepxpus and zojgpus, so yovypus ⊂ bepxpus\n\nbepxpus is zavfpus, so bepxpus ⊂ zavfpus\n\nzavfpus is gonppus and qarqpus, so zavfpus ⊂ gonppus\n\ngonppus is vilwpus, so gonppus ⊂ vilwpus\n\nvilwpus is yujrpus and fisxpus, so vilwpus ⊂ yujrpus\n\nyujrpus is xinmpus, so yujrpus ⊂ xinmpus\n\nxinmpus is tebppus and jucgpus, so xinmpus ⊂ tebppus\n\ntebppus is luxcpus, so tebppus ⊂ luxcpus\n\nluxcpus is babbpus, so luxcpus ⊂ babbpus\n\nTherefore, by transitivity, deshpus ⊂ babbpus.\n\nSince x is deshpus, x ⊂ babbpus, meaning x is contained in babbpus, so x is babbpus.\n\nThus, it is true that x is babbpus.\n\nSo the answer is true.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

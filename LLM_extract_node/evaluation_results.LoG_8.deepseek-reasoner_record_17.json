  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babbpus, babcpus, and babppus. Based on the given information, x is kiydpus. So, I have to trace from kiydpus to see if it connects to these categories.\n\nThe information says: \"x is kiydpus.\" So, x belongs to kiydpus.\n\nNow, I need to find if kiydpus is connected to babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nLet me list out all the relevant statements from the given information.\n\nI see that babbpus is mentioned: \"pezfpus is babbpus.\" And pezfpus is related to zipbpus: \"zipbpus is pezfpus and fufjpus.\" Also, \"zipbpus is jahppus.\" But I need to connect kiydpus to pezfpus or directly to babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, babcpus is mentioned: \"fumgpus is babcpus.\" And fumgpus is related to other things.\n\nbabppus is mentioned: \"xaxrpus is babppus and xakfpus.\" And xaxrpus is related to zinxpus: \"zinxpus is xaxrpus.\" And zinxpus is related to hultpus: \"hultpus is zinxpus and togbpus.\" And hultpus is related to zutfpus: \"zutfpus is hultpus and beyfpus and fohrpus.\" And so on.\n\nI need to find a path from kiydpus to these.\n\nStart with x is kiydpus.\n\nFrom the information: \"kiydpus is kortpus and venqpus.\" So kiydpus belongs to kortpus and venqpus.\n\nNow, kortpus is mentioned: \"kortpus is jofhpus and ketfpus.\"\n\njofhpus is mentioned: \"jofhpus is wuklpus and lazjpus.\"\n\nwuklpus is mentioned: \"wuklpus is juvlpus.\"\n\njuvlpus is mentioned: \"juvlpus is mafppus.\"\n\nmafppus is mentioned: \"mafppus is qatwpus and hijkpus and qowrpus and xagppus.\"\n\nqatwpus is mentioned: \"qatwpus is jeljpus.\" and \"qatwpus is logtpus.\" But since \"is\" means belongs to, it might have multiple categories.\n\nAlso, \"logtpus is dadgpus.\" and \"dadgpus is tevppus.\" and \"tevppus is seztpus.\" and \"seztpus is kadvpus.\" and \"kadvpus is wokkpus.\" but that might not help for babbpus.\n\nI need to get to babbpus. babbpus is from pezfpus, and pezfpus is from zipbpus.\n\nzipbpus is jahppus, and jahppus is noxgpus, etc.\n\nBut let's see if kiydpus connects to zipbpus.\n\nFrom kiydpus, we have kortpus, then jofhpus, then wuklpus, then juvlpus, then mafppus. Now mafppus is qatwpus, but qatwpus is jeljpus, and jeljpus is derzpus and qocrpus, and derzpus is kusgpus, and kusgpus is lokypus, etc. This seems long and might not lead to zipbpus.\n\nPerhaps through another path. kiydpus is also venqpus, but venqpus isn't directly defined, so I need to see where venqpus is mentioned or if it connects to anything.\n\nLooking back at the information, I don't see any other mention of venqpus. So perhaps venqpus is not defined, so we can't use it.\n\nBut kiydpus is kortpus and venqpus, so we can use kortpus.\n\nkortpus is jofhpus and ketfpus. ketfpus isn't mentioned elsewhere, so we might only have jofhpus.\n\njofhpus is wuklpus and lazjpus. lazjpus isn't mentioned elsewhere, so we have wuklpus.\n\nwuklpus is juvlpus.\n\njuvlpus is mafppus.\n\nmafppus is qatwpus and hijkpus and qowrpus and xagppus.\n\nNow, qatwpus is mentioned in multiple places: \"qatwpus is jeljpus\" and \"qatwpus is logtpus\". So qatwpus belongs to jeljpus and also to logtpus.\n\nBut we need to get to babbpus, which is from pezfpus, which is from zipbpus.\n\nzipbpus is jahppus, and jahppus is noxgpus, and noxgpus is mamlpus or meqtpus? \"noxgpus is mamlpus\" and also \"noxgpus is meqtpus\"? No, from the information: \"jahppus is noxgpus\" and \"noxgpus is mamlpus\" and also \"noxgpus is meqtpus\"? Let's see: \"noxgpus is mamlpus\" is stated, and later \"noxgpus is meqtpus\" is stated? Actually, looking at the text: \"jahppus is noxgpus.\" and then \"noxgpus is mamlpus.\" and later \"noxgpus is meqtpus.\"? No, in the text, it says: \"jahppus is noxgpus.\" and then later \"noxgpus is meqtpus.\" but is that possible? Since \"is\" means belongs to, noxgpus can belong to multiple categories, so it can be both mamlpus and meqtpus.\n\nBut let's list all statements about noxgpus.\n\nFrom the text: \"zipbpus is jahppus.\" and \"jahppus is noxgpus.\" so zipbpus -> jahppus -> noxgpus.\n\nAlso, \"noxgpus is mamlpus.\" from \"noxgpus is mamlpus.\"? Wait, in the text: \"jahppus is noxgpus.\" and then \"noxgpus is mamlpus.\" is not directly stated? Let's read carefully.\n\nThe text says: \"zipbpus is jahppus.\" and then \"jahppus is noxgpus.\" and then later \"noxgpus is mamlpus.\"? Actually, in the given information, I see: \"jahppus is noxgpus.\" and then after that, \"noxgpus is mamlpus.\" is not present. Let's scan the entire text.\n\nHere are the relevant lines:\n\n\"zipbpus is jahppus.\"\n\n\"jahppus is noxgpus.\"\n\nAnd then later: \"noxgpus is meqtpus.\"? No, I see: \"noxgpus is meqtpus.\" is not there.

But qatwpus is jeljpus and also logtpus.\n\njeljpus is derzpus and qocrpus.\n\nderzpus is kusgpus and also comrpus and getlpus.\n\nkusgpus is lokypus.\n\nlokypus is tuqnpus and doxbpus, and also zuqzpus, and also sihkpus and pudlpus.\n\ntuqnpus is goqdpus and also qasxpus.\n\nqasxpus is suzvpus.\n\nsuzvpus is hughpus.\n\nhughpus is vehrpus and xijwpus.\n\nvehrpus is boyzpus.\n\nboyzpus is sivnpus and wucnpus and vosfpus.\n\nsivnpus is sewqpus.\n\nsewqpus is luwxpus.\n\nluwxpus is qezspus and sixxpus.\n\nqezspus is robdpus.\n\nrobdpus is heytpus and qultpus.\n\nheytpus is kumfpus.\n\nkumfpus is cisqpus.\n\ncisqpus is lowfpus and tofrpus.\n\nlowfpus is rozgpus and qiwmpus.\n\nrozgpus is terjpus and qemkpus and xeqwpus.\n\nterjpus is fumgpus and zeqwpus.\n\nfumgpus is lasvpus and also babcpus. So here we have fumgpus is babcpus.\n\nSo, from kiydpus, through a long chain, we reach terjpus, which is fumgpus, and fumgpus is babcpus. So, does that mean kiydpus is babcpus? Since \"is\" means belongs to, and we have a chain of belonging, if A is B and B is C, then A is C? But in this context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if A belongs to B and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C? That seems logical. So, transitive closure should hold.\n\nSo, from kiydpus to babcpus: kiydpus -> kortpus -> jofhpus -> wuklpus -> juvlpus -> mafppus -> qatwpus -> jeljpus -> derzpus -> kusgpus -> lokypus -> tuqnpus -> qasxpus -> suzvpus -> hughpus -> vehrpus -> boyzpus -> sivnpus -> sewqpus -> luwxpus -> qezspus -> robdpus -> heytpus -> kumfpus -> cisqpus -> lowfpus -> rozgpus -> terjpus -> fumgpus -> babcpus.\n\nThat is a very long chain, but it seems valid. So, kiydpus belongs to babcpus. Therefore, x is babcpus.\n\nBut we need to check for babbpus and babppus as well.\n\nNow, for babbpus: babbpus is from pezfpus, and pezfpus is from zipbpus.\n\nWe need to see if kiydpus is connected to zipbpus.\n\nFrom kiydpus, we have the same chain, but we need to reach zipbpus.\n\nzipbpus is jahppus, and jahppus is noxgpus, etc.\n\nBut from the chain above, we don't directly get to zipbpus.\n\nPerhaps through another path.\n\nNotice that zipbpus is also related to vefvpus: \"vefvpus is zipbpus and lebqpus and yabmpus.\" and vefvpus is from bixwpus: \"bixwpus is vefvpus.\" and bixwpus is from gefdpus: \"gefdpus is bixwpus.\" and gefdpus is from cajspus: \"cajspus is gefdpus.\" and cajspus is from zuqzpus: \"zuqzpus is cajspus.\" and zuqzpus is from lokypus: \"lokypus is zuqzpus.\" and we have lokypus from earlier chain.\n\nSo from lokypus, we can go to zuqzpus -> cajspus -> gefdpus -> bixwpus -> vefvpus -> zipbpus -> pezfpus -> babbpus.\n\nSo, from kiydpus, we have kusgpus -> lokypus -> zuqzpus -> cajspus -> gefdpus -> bixwpus -> vefvpus -> zipbpus -> pezfpus -> babbpus.\n\nTherefore, kiydpus belongs to babbpus.\n\nSo, x is babbpus.\n\nNow, for babppus: babppus is from xaxrpus: \"xaxrpus is babppus and xakfpus.\"\n\nxaxrpus is from zinxpus: \"zinxpus is xaxrpus.\"\n\nzinxpus is from hultpus: \"hultpus is zinxpus and togbpus.\"\n\nhultpus is from zutfpus: \"zutfpus is hultpus and beyfpus and fohrpus.\"\n\nzutfpus is from vosmpus: \"vosmpus is zutfpus.\"\n\nvosmpus is from sihkpus: \"sihkpus is vosmpus and kithpus.\"\n\nsihkpus is from lokypus: \"lokypus is sihkpus and pudlpus.\"\n\nAnd we have lokypus from earlier.\n\nSo from lokypus, we can go to sihkpus -> vosmpus -> zutfpus -> hultpus -> zinxpus -> xaxrpus -> babppus.\n\nTherefore, kiydpus belongs to babppus.\n\nSo, since x is kiydpus, and kiydpus belongs to babbpus, babcpus, and babppus, then x is all three.\n\nThe question is: \"x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus?\" which should be true.\n\nBut let's confirm if all chains are valid.\n\nWe have three chains:\n\nFor babcpus: we have kiydpus -> kortpus -> jofhpus -> wuklpus -> juvlpus -> mafppus -> qatwpus -> jeljpus -> derzpus -> kusgpus -> lokypus -> tuqnpus -> qasxpus -> suzvpus -> hughpus -> vehrpus -> boyzpus -> sivnpus -> sewqpus -> luwxpus -> qezspus -> robdpus -> heytpus -> kumfpus -> cisqpus -> lowfpus -> rozgpus -> terjpus -> fumgpus -> babcpus.\n\nThis chain seems correct based on the statements.\n\nFor babbpus: from lokypus (which we have from kusgpus), we go to zuqzpus -> cajspus -> gefdpus -> bixwpus -> vefvpus -> zipbpus -> pezfpus -> babbpus.\n\nYes.\n\nFor babppus: from lokypus, we go to sihkpus -> vosmpus -> zutfpus -> hultpus -> zinxpus -> xaxrpus -> babppus.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, all paths are connected.\n\nTherefore, x is indeed babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nThe question says \"and babppus\" but in the text, it's babppus, which is from xaxrpus.\n\nAlso, note that in the chain for babcpus, we used terjpus which is fumgpus, and fumgpus is babcpus.\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nSo, I think it's correct.",

But qatwpus is jeljpus and also logtpus.\n\njeljpus is derzpus and qocrpus.\n\nderzpus is kusgpus and also comrpus and getlpus.\n\nkusgpus is lokypus.\n\nlokypus is tuqnpus and doxbpus, and also zuqzpus, and also sihkpus and pudlpus.\n\ntuqnpus is goqdpus and also qasxpus.\n\nqasxpus is suzvpus.\n\nsuzvpus is hughpus.\n\nhughpus is vehrpus and xijwpus.\n\nvehrpus is boyzpus.\n\nboyzpus is sivnpus and wucnpus and vosfpus.\n\nsivnpus is sewqpus.\n\nsewqpus is luwxpus.\n\nluwxpus is qezspus and sixxpus.\n\nqezspus is robdpus.\n\nrobdpus is heytpus and qultpus.\n\nheytpus is kumfpus.\n\nkumfpus is cisqpus.\n\ncisqpus is lowfpus and tofrpus.\n\nlowfpus is rozgpus and qiwmpus.\n\nrozgpus is terjpus and qemkpus and xeqwpus.\n\nterjpus is fumgpus and zeqwpus.\n\nfumgpus is lasvpus and also babcpus. So here we have fumgpus is babcpus.\n\nSo, from kiydpus, through a long chain, we reach terjpus, which is fumgpus, and fumgpus is babcpus. So, does that mean kiydpus is babcpus? Since \"is\" means belongs to, and we have a chain of belonging, if A is B and B is C, then A is C? But in this context, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if A belongs to B and B belongs to C, then A belongs to C? That seems logical. So, transitive closure should hold.\n\nSo, from kiydpus to babcpus: kiydpus -> kortpus -> jofhpus -> wuklpus -> juvlpus -> mafppus -> qatwpus -> jeljpus -> derzpus -> kusgpus -> lokypus -> tuqnpus -> qasxpus -> suzvpus -> hughpus -> vehrpus -> boyzpus -> sivnpus -> sewqpus -> luwxpus -> qezspus -> robdpus -> heytpus -> kumfpus -> cisqpus -> lowfpus -> rozgpus -> terjpus -> fumgpus -> babcpus.\n\nThat is a very long chain, but it seems valid. So, kiydpus belongs to babcpus. Therefore, x is babcpus.\n\nBut we need to check for babbpus and babppus as well.\n\nNow, for babbpus: babbpus is from pezfpus, and pezfpus is from zipbpus.\n\nWe need to see if kiydpus is connected to zipbpus.\n\nFrom kiydpus, we have the same chain, but we need to reach zipbpus.\n\nzipbpus is jahppus, and jahppus is noxgpus, etc.\n\nBut from the chain above, we don't directly get to zipbpus.\n\nPerhaps through another path.\n\nNotice that zipbpus is also related to vefvpus: \"vefvpus is zipbpus and lebqpus and yabmpus.\" and vefvpus is from bixwpus: \"bixwpus is vefvpus.\" and bixwpus is from gefdpus: \"gefdpus is bixwpus.\" and gefdpus is from cajspus: \"cajspus is gefdpus.\" and cajspus is from zuqzpus: \"zuqzpus is cajspus.\" and zuqzpus is from lokypus: \"lokypus is zuqzpus.\" and we have lokypus from earlier chain.\n\nSo from lokypus, we can go to zuqzpus -> cajspus -> gefdpus -> bixwpus -> vefvpus -> zipbpus -> pezfpus -> babbpus.\n\nSo, from kiydpus, we have kusgpus -> lokypus -> zuqzpus -> cajspus -> gefdpus -> bixwpus -> vefvpus -> zipbpus -> pezfpus -> babbpus.\n\nTherefore, kiydpus belongs to babbpus.\n\nSo, x is babbpus.\n\nNow, for babppus: babppus is from xaxrpus: \"xaxrpus is babppus and xakfpus.\"\n\nxaxrpus is from zinxpus: \"zinxpus is xaxrpus.\"\n\nzinxpus is from hultpus: \"hultpus is zinxpus and togbpus.\"\n\nhultpus is from zutfpus: \"zutfpus is hultpus and beyfpus and fohrpus.\"\n\nzutfpus is from vosmpus: \"vosmpus is zutfpus.\"\n\nvosmpus is from sihkpus: \"sihkpus is vosmpus and kithpus.\"\n\nsihkpus is from lokypus: \"lokypus is sihkpus and pudlpus.\"\n\nAnd we have lokypus from earlier.\n\nSo from lokypus, we can go to sihkpus -> vosmpus -> zutfpus -> hultpus -> zinxpus -> xaxrpus -> babppus.\n\nTherefore, kiydpus belongs to babppus.\n\nSo, since x is kiydpus, and kiydpus belongs to babbpus, babcpus, and babppus, then x is all three.\n\nThe question is: \"x is babbpus and babcpus and babppus?\" which should be true.\n\nBut let's confirm if all chains are valid.\n\nWe have three chains:\n\nFor babcpus: we have kiydpus -> kortpus -> jofhpus -> wuklpus -> juvlpus -> mafppus -> qatwpus -> jeljpus -> derzpus -> kusgpus -> lokypus -> tuqnpus -> qasxpus -> suzvpus -> hughpus -> vehrpus -> boyzpus -> sivnpus -> sewqpus -> luwxpus -> qezspus -> robdpus -> heytpus -> kumfpus -> cisqpus -> lowfpus -> rozgpus -> terjpus -> fumgpus -> babcpus.\n\nThis chain seems correct based on the statements.\n\nFor babbpus: from lokypus (which we have from kusgpus), we go to zuqzpus -> cajspus -> gefdpus -> bixwpus -> vefvpus -> zipbpus -> pezfpus -> babbpus.\n\nYes.\n\nFor babppus: from lokypus, we go to sihkpus -> vosmpus -> zutfpus -> hultpus -> zinxpus -> xaxrpus -> babppus.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, all paths are connected.\n\nTherefore, x is indeed babbpus, babcpus, and babppus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nThe question says \"and babppus\" but in the text, it's babppus, which is from xaxrpus.\n\nAlso, note that in the chain for babcpus, we used terjpus which is fumgpus, and fumgpus is babcpus.\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nSo, I think it's correct.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, I think it's correct.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

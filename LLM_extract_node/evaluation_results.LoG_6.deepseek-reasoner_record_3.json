  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to understand the relationships given. The statements are of the form \"A is B\", which means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So, it's about set membership or hierarchy.\n\nI have the following statements:\n\n1. savspus is komhpus.\n\n2. komhpus is kerlpus and nayjpus. (This probably means komhpus is contained in both kerlpus and nayjpus, or it might mean that komhpus has properties of both, but in terms of categories, I think it means komhpus is a subset of kerlpus and also a subset of nayjpus.)\n\nThe note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so for \"komhpus is kerlpus and nayjpus\", it might mean that komhpus is a type of kerlpus and also a type of nayjpus. But since it says \"and\", it could be that komhpus is both, meaning it's in the intersection.\n\nSimilarly, other statements.\n\nLet me list all the statements clearly:\n\n- savspus is komhpus.\n\n- komhpus is kerlpus and nayjpus.\n\n- kadypus is savspus and becmpus and jepmpus.\n\n- buxnpus is keyfpus.\n\n- sarhpus is kadypus and qowvpus.\n\n- vasxpus is babgpus and hobxpus and hommpus.\n\n- buxnpus is sarhpus.\n\n- x is buxnpus and wohwpus.\n\n- kerlpus is vasxpus.\n\nThe question is: Is it true or false or unknown that x is babgpus or babrpus?\n\nI need to trace the relationships from x to babgpus or babrpus.\n\nFirst, x is buxnpus and wohwpus. So x belongs to buxnpus and also to wohwpus. But we need to see if x is babgpus or babrpus.\n\nbabrpus is not mentioned anywhere in the given information. So, we have no information about babrpus. Therefore, for babrpus, it might be unknown.\n\nBut we need to check for babgpus as well.\n\nbabgpus is mentioned in: vasxpus is babgpus and hobxpus and hommpus. So vasxpus contains babgpus, or vasxpus is a type of babgpus? The statement is \"vasxpus is babgpus\" which means vasxpus belongs to babgpus, so vasxpus is a subset of babgpus or a member of babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, we need to see if x is connected to vasxpus or directly to babgpus.\n\nNow, from x: x is buxnpus.\n\nbuxnpus is keyfpus? No, buxnpus is keyfpus? Let's see: \"buxnpus is keyfpus\" is given, but also \"buxnpus is sarhpus\" is given.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- buxnpus is keyfpus. (from \"buxnpus is keyfpus\")\n\n- and buxnpus is sarhpus. (from \"buxnpus is sarhpus\")\n\nSo buxnpus belongs to keyfpus and to sarhpus.\n\nBut x is buxnpus, so x belongs to buxnpus, which means x is a member of buxnpus, so since buxnpus is keyfpus, x is also keyfpus? Similarly, since buxnpus is sarhpus, x is also sarhpus? Not necessarily directly, but through membership.\n\nIf A is B, and B is C, then A is C? We need to see the transitivity.\n\nThe note says \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so if A is B, and B is C, then A should be C, because belonging to B means A is in B, and B is in C, so A is in C.\n\nSimilarly, if A is B and B is D, then A is D.\n\nSo, we can chain these relationships.\n\nNow, x is buxnpus.\n\nbuxnpus is sarhpus. (from \"buxnpus is sarhpus\")\n\nAlso, buxnpus is keyfpus, but that might not be relevant now.\n\nNow, sarhpus is kadypus and qowvpus. (from \"sarhpus is kadypus and qowvpus\")\n\nSo, since buxnpus is sarhpus, and sarhpus is kadypus, therefore buxnpus is kadypus? Similarly, buxnpus is qowvpus.\n\nBut we need to get to babgpus.\n\nNow, kadypus is savspus and becmpus and jepmpus. (from \"kadypus is savspus and becmpus and jepmpus\")\n\nSo, from buxnpus is kadypus, so buxnpus is savspus, etc.\n\nBut we need kerlpus and vasxpus.\n\nWe have kerlpus is vasxpus. (from \"kerlpus is vasxpus\")\n\nAnd vasxpus is babgpus and hobxpus and hommpus. So vasxpus is babgpus, meaning vasxpus belongs to babgpus, so any member of vasxpus is also babgpus? Or since vasxpus is babgpus, it means that vasxpus is a subset of babgpus, so if something is vasxpus, it is babgpus.\n\nSimilarly, we need to see if x is vasxpus.\n\nHow to connect x to vasxpus?\n\nWe have komhpus is kerlpus and nayjpus.\n\nAnd kerlpus is vasxpus.\n\nSo komhpus is kerlpus, and kerlpus is vasxpus, so komhpus is vasxpus.\n\nNow, savspus is komhpus, so savspus is komhpus, and komhpus is vasxpus, so savspus is vasxpus.\n\nNow, kadypus is savspus, so kadypus is savspus, and savspus is vasxpus, so kadypus is vasxpus.\n\nNow, sarhpus is kadypus, so sarhpus is kadypus, and kadypus is vasxpus, so sarhpus is vasxpus.\n\nNow, buxnpus is sarhpus, so buxnpus is sarhpus, and sarhpus is vasxpus, so buxnpus is vasxpus.\n\nAnd since x is buxnpus, so x is buxnpus, and buxnpus is vasxpus, so x is vasxpus.\n\nThen, since vasxpus is babgpus, so x is babgpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babgpus or babrpus?\" Since we have x is babgpus, it is true that x is babgpus or babrpus, because even if babrpus is unknown, the OR is true if one is true.\n\nSo, since x is babgpus, the statement \"x is babgpus or babrpus\" is true.\n\nNow, we need to confirm if all these inferences are valid.\n\nLet me write the chain step by step.\n\nFrom given:\n\nkerlpus is vasxpus. (direct)\n\nkomhpus is kerlpus. (from \"komhpus is kerlpus and nayjpus\" so komhpus is kerlpus)\n\nThus, komhpus is vasxpus. (since komhpus is kerlpus and kerlpus is vasxpus)\n\nsavspus is komhpus. (given)\n\nThus, savspus is vasxpus. (since savspus is komhpus and komhpus is vasxpus)\n\nkadypus is savspus. (from \"kadypus is savspus and becmpus and jepmpus\")\n\nThus, kadypus is vasxpus. (since kadypus is savspus and savspus is vasxpus)\n\nsarhpus is kadypus. (from \"sarhpus is kadypus and qowvpus\")\n\nThus, sarhpus is vasxpus. (since sarhpus is kadypus and kadypus is vasxpus)\n\nbuxnpus is sarhpus. (given)\n\nThus, buxnpus is vasxpus. (since buxnpus is sarhpus and sarhpus is vasxpus)\n\nx is buxnpus. (from \"x is buxnpus and wohwpus\")\n\nThus, x is vasxpus. (since x is buxnpus and buxnpus is vasxpus)\n\nvasxpus is babgpus. (from \"vasxpus is babgpus and hobxpus and hommpus\")\n\nThus, x is babgpus. (since x is vasxpus and vasxpus is babgpus)\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus.\n\nSo, for the question \"x is babgpus or babrpus?\", since x is babgpus, it is true.\n\nWe don't know anything about babrpus, but that doesn't matter because the OR condition is satisfied by babgpus.\n\nSo, the answer should be true.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no contradictions or missing links.\n\nAlso, note that x is also wohwpus, but that doesn't affect this reasoning.\n\nAnd babrpus is not mentioned, so we have no information, but since x is babgpus, the OR is true.\n\nTherefore, it is true.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nTherefore, it is true.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

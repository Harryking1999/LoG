  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to find out what x is. From the given information, it says: \"x is gevgpus.\" So, x belongs to gevgpus.\n\nNow, I need to see if x is babbpus or babmpus or babnpus. But I don't see any direct connection to these categories yet. I need to trace through the relationships.\n\nLet me list out what gevgpus is. From the information: \"gevgpus is xivcpus and fidypus.\" So gevgpus contains xivcpus and fidypus. But since x is gevgpus, it means x is in that category, so I need to find what gevgpus consists of, but actually, since x is gevgpus, and gevgpus might contain other things, but for the purpose of this question, I need to see if x itself is one of those babbpus, etc., or if gevgpus is related to them.\n\nThe question is whether x is babbpus or babmpus or babnpus. Since x is gevgpus, I need to see if gevgpus is equivalent to or contains one of these, but the question is about x being those, so if gevgpus is one of them, then x would be, but from the \"is\" meaning, it might be that gevgpus is a category that includes x, but x is an instance, so if gevgpus is babbpus, then x is babbpus because x is gevgpus.\n\nBut let's see the definitions. The note says: \"'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\" So when we say \"x is gevgpus\", it means x is contained in gevgpus, so gevgpus is a category that contains x. Similarly, when we say \"gevgpus is xivcpus and fidypus\", it means gevgpus is contained in xivcpus and also contained in fidypus? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So if A is B, then B is a category, and A is a member or subset of B.\n\nBut in the statements, sometimes it says \"A is B and C\", which might mean A is contained in B and also contained in C, or it might mean that B and C are categories that A belongs to.\n\nI think I need to interpret each statement as defining relationships.\n\nLet me take an example from the information: \"pawlpus is dezvpus.\" So pawlpus belongs to dezvpus.\n\n\"citfpus is nudvpus and yimcpus.\" So citfpus belongs to nudvpus and also to yimcpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"cosgpus is fiqrpus and wuxgpus\" so cosgpus belongs to fiqrpus and wuxgpus.\n\nSo in general, \"A is B\" means A is a subset of B or A is an instance of B.\n\nFor the question, \"x is babbpus or babmpus or babnpus?\" we need to see if x is contained in any of these categories.\n\nSince x is contained in gevgpus, I need to find out what gevgpus is contained in, and so on, until I see if it connects to babbpus, etc.\n\nBut I also need to see if x is directly one of them, but since x is given as gevgpus, probably gevgpus is a category, and x is an instance, so I need to find the hierarchy.\n\nActually, from the information, we have many such statements, and I need to find a path to babbpus, babmpus, or babnpus.\n\nFirst, let's list all relevant statements for x.\n\nx is gevgpus.\n\ngevgpus is xivcpus and fidypus. So gevgpus belongs to xivcpus and to fidypus. That means x is in gevgpus, so x is also in xivcpus and fidypus? Not necessarily. If gevgpus is contained in xivcpus, then every member of gevgpus is also in xivcpus, so since x is in gevgpus, x is in xivcpus. Similarly for fidypus.\n\nSo from \"gevgpus is xivcpus\" meaning gevgpus ⊆ xivcpus, so x ∈ gevgpus ⊆ xivcpus, so x ∈ xivcpus.\n\nSimilarly, gevgpus is fidypus, so x ∈ fidypus.\n\nBut for the question, we need x to be in babbpus or etc.\n\nSo I need to find if xivcpus or fidypus is related to babbpus, etc.\n\nNow, let's look at xivcpus. From information: \"xivcpus is rucypus and suwlpus.\" Also, \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus.\" There are multiple statements about xivcpus.\n\nThis might be messy. I need to organize the data.\n\nSince the question is about babbpus or babmpus or babnpus, I should look for those terms in the information.\n\nI see \"babmpus\" mentioned in one place: \"lutfpus is babmpus and lepspus.\" So babmpus is a category that lutfpus belongs to.\n\nBut lutfpus is mentioned elsewhere: \"satnpus is lutfpus.\" and \"xojjpus is satnpus and cuzdpus.\" and \"qibqpus is xojjpus.\" etc.\n\nBut we need x to be babmpus, meaning x should be contained in babmpus.\n\nSimilarly, babbpus and babnpus are not directly mentioned in the information, as far as I can see. Let me search for \"babbpus\" and \"babnpus\" in the text.\n\nI don't see \"babbpus\" or \"babnpus\" anywhere in the given information. I only see \"babmpus\" in \"lutfpus is babmpus and lepspus.\"\n\nSo for babbpus and babnpus, since they are not mentioned, it is likely that x is not contained in them, but we need to confirm if x is babmpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus or babmpus or babnpus?\" so if x is not any of them, it might be false or unknown.\n\nBut since babbpus and babnpus are not defined, probably x is not in them, but we need to see for babmpus.\n\nSo let's focus on whether x is in babmpus.\n\nSince x is in gevgpus, and gevgpus is in xivcpus, etc., I need to see if xivcpus or any of its ancestors are connected to babmpus.\n\nFrom the information, we have \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus.\" and \"vuyjpus is talmpus.\" from \"vuyjpus is talmpus.\"? Let's see: \"vuyjpus is talmpus.\" is not directly stated, but from \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus\" and then \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" ? No, I need to find what vuyjpus is.\n\nFrom the information: \"vuyjpus is talmpus.\" is not said. Instead, I see \"talmpus is diqtpus.\" and \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not stated.\n\nLet's list all statements involving vuyjpus.\n\nFrom the information: \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus.\" This means xivcpus is contained in vuyjpus and in wezbpus? Or does it mean that vuyjpus and wezbpus are categories that xivcpus belongs to?\n\nAccording to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if \"xivcpus is vuyjpus\", it means xivcpus is contained in vuyjpus, so vuyjpus is a broader category.\n\nSimilarly, \"xivcpus is wezbpus\" so xivcpus is contained in wezbpus.\n\nBut also, from earlier, \"gevgpus is xivcpus\" so gevggpus is contained in xivcpus, so since xivcpus is contained in vuyjpus, then gevgpus is contained in vuyjpus, and thus x is in vuyjpus.\n\nSimilarly, from \"xivcpus is rucypus and suwlpus\" so xivcpus is contained in rucypus and in suwlpus.\n\nSo let's trace the containment.\n\nNow, for vuyjpus, what is it? Is vuyjpus contained in something else? Or is it a category that contains other things?\n\nFrom the information, I see \"vuyjpus is talmpus.\"? No, I don't see that. Let's read carefully.\n\nI see: \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not stated. Instead, I see: \"talmpus is diqtpus.\" and also from \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus\" but no direct statement about vuyjpus being something else.\n\nBut later, I see: \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not there. Let's list all statements from the information.\n\nI need to parse the information step by step.\n\nPerhaps I should list all the \"is\" statements in a structured way.\n\nBut that might take too long. Since the question is about x and babmpus, I should find a path to babmpus.\n\nbabmpus is mentioned only in \"lutfpus is babmpus and lepspus.\"\n\nSo lutfpus is contained in babmpus.\n\nSo if x is contained in lutfpus, then x would be in babmpus, but x is in gevgpus, so I need to see if gevgpus is contained in lutfpus or if there is a chain from gevgpus to lutfpus.\n\nlutfpus is also mentioned in \"satnpus is lutfpus.\" so satnpus is contained in lutfpus.\n\nAnd \"xojjpus is satnpus and cuzdpus.\" so xojjpus is contained in satnpus and cuzdpus.\n\nAnd \"qibqpus is xojjpus.\" so qibqpus is contained in xojjpus.\n\nAnd \"gonspus is qibqpus and qalypus.\" so gonspus is contained in qibqpus and qalypus.\n\nAnd \"ravnpus is gonspus and norgpus.\" so ravnpus is contained in gonspus and norgpus.\n\nAnd \"gapjpus is ravnpus.\" so gapjpus is contained in ravnpus.\n\nAnd \"zoyspus is gapjpus and kujwpus.\" so zoyspus is contained in gapjpus and kujwpus.\n\nAnd \"wonypus is zoyspus.\" so wonypus is contained in zoyspus.\n\nAnd \"zujtpus is wonypus.\" so zujtpus is contained in wonypus.\n\nAnd \"detppus is zujtpus.\" so detppus is contained in zujtpus.\n\nAnd \"kekxpus is detppus and muyypus.\" so kekxpus is contained in detppus and muyypus.\n\nAnd \"buyqpus is kekxpus and sawzpus.\" so buyqpus is contained in kekxpus and sawzpus.\n\nAnd \"giflpus is buyqpus.\" so giflpus is contained in buyqpus.\n\nAnd \"nuzqpus is giflpus and qovnpus.\" so nuzqpus is contained in giflpus and qovnpus.\n\nAnd \"waqwpus is nuzqpus and suhhpus.\" so waqwpus is contained in nuzqpus and suhhpus.\n\nAnd \"lullpus is waqwpus.\" so lullpus is contained in waqwpus.\n\nAnd \"letppus is lullpus.\" so letppus is contained in lullpus.\n\nAnd \"suhrpus is letppus.\" so suhrpus is contained in letppus.\n\nAnd \"yoqvpus is suhrpus and peyypus.\" so yoqvpus is contained in suhrpus and peyypus.\n\nAnd \"mojkpus is yoqvpus.\" so mojkpus is contained in yoqvpus.\n\nAnd \"fesnpus is mojkpus and yipspus and yidtpus.\" so fesnpus is contained in mojkpus, yipspus, and yidtpus.\n\nAnd \"kijppus is fesnpus and zomhpus.\" so kijppus is contained in fesnpus and zomhpus.\n\nAnd \"yiywpus is kijppus and tatjpus.\" so yiywpus is contained in kijppus and tatjpus.\n\nAnd \"sochpus is yiywpus.\" so sochpus is contained in yiywpus.\n\nAnd \"bihnpus is sochpus.\" so bihnpus is contained in sochpus.\n\nAnd \"qanrpus is bihnpus.\" so qanrpus is contained in bihnpus.\n\nAnd \"nepspus is qanrpus and qupspus.\" so nepspus is contained in qanrpus and qupspus.\n\nAnd \"beywpus is nepspus.\" so beywpus is contained in nepspus.\n\nAnd \"kefspus is beywpus.\" so kefspus is contained in beywpus.\n\nAnd \"faldpus is kefspus and ruqgpus and gerzpus.\" so faldpus is contained in kefspus, ruqgpus, and gerzpus.\n\nAnd \"jajmpus is falbpus.\" and \"fiqtpus is jajmpus.\" but we have \"jiyfpus is fiqtpus.\" and \"fizxpus is jiyfpus.\" and \"waffpus is fizxpus.\" and \"wehrpus is waffpus.\" and \"jafrpus is wehrpus and vogkpus.\" and \"duplpus is jafrpus and legxpus.\" and \"lomkpus is duplpus.\" and \"vakkpus is lomkpus and tazzpus and qidjpus.\" and \"dolspus is vakkpus.\" and \"javcpus is dolspus and pohxpus.\" and \"dezvpus is javcpus.\" and \"pawlpus is dezvpus.\" and \"hixdpus is pawlpus and vewkpus and hehrpus.\" and \"resvpus is hixdpus.\" and \"bugqpus is resvpus.\" and \"paqbpus is bugqpus and neddpus.\" and \"gimvpus is paqbpus.\" and \"xajbpus is gimvpus and gofypus.\" and \"fazppus is xajbpus.\" and \"pupmpus is fazppus and yanlpus and sekmpus.\" and \"rabwpus is pupmpus.\" and \"paywpus is rabwpus.\" and \"tigqpus is paywpus and nokcpus and masmpus and jucxpus.\" and \"mochpus is tigqpus.\" and \"nazjpus is mochpus.\" and \"lanfpus is nazjpus and tukppus and yakcpus.\" and \"fowypus is lanfpus and yuxdpus.\" and \"gawbpus is fowypus and kijbpus and bedgpus.\" and \"ketvpus is gawbpus.\" and \"vedlpus is ketvpus.\" and \"jacvpus is vedlpus and qovwpus.\" and \"sirmpus is jacvpus.\" and \"nudvpus is sirmpus and bahmpus.\" and \"citfpus is nudvpus and yimcpus.\" and \"wohypus is citfpus and xivhpus.\" and \"kagkpus is wohypus.\" and \"fethpus is kagkpus.\" and \"ceqxpus is fethpus.\" and \"yajnpus is ceqxpus.\" and \"tuvqpus is yajnpus.\" and \"givspus is tuvqpus.\" and \"zosfpus is givspus.\"? No, from \"givspus is tuvqpus\" so givspus is contained in tuvqpus, and \"zosfpus is givspus\" is not stated, but from \"zugppus is givspus and sawtpus\" and \"kipjpus is zugppus and dibjpus\" and \"qonppus is kipjpus\" and \"fiqrpus is maqcpus and mafnpus\" and \"cosgpus is fiqrpus and wuxgpus\" and \"rumjpus is cosgpus\" and \"tutrpus is rumjpus\" and \"sojppus is tutrpus\" and \"qiqqpus is sojppus\" and \"sajnpus is qiqqpus\" and \"pewzpus is sajnpus\" and \"dufmpus is pewzpus\" and \"mugbpus is dufmpus\" and \"zuwrpus is mugbpus and jotmpus\" and \"zasvpus is zuwrpus\" and also \"zasvpus is fejwpus and qorxpus\" and \"wahmpus is zasvpus and fikwpus\" and \"fubbpus is wahmpus and rapcpus\" and \"diqtpus is fubbpus\" and \"talmpus is diqtpus\" and from earlier, we have \"vuyjpus is talmpus\"? No, I don't have that.\n\nI think I missed something. In the beginning, I have \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus\" but I need to know what vuyjpus is.\n\nFrom the information, there is no statement that vuyjpus is something else. Similarly, wezbpus is not defined further.\n\nBut from \"gevgpus is xivcpus\" so x is in xivcpus, and xivcpus is in vuyjpus, so x is in vuyjpus.\n\nBut vuyjpus is not connected to talmpus directly.\n\nHowever, I see \"talmpus is diqtpus\" and \"diqtpus is fubbpus\" etc., but no link to vuyjpus.\n\nBut wait, I recall that in the list, there is \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not stated, but let's read the information again carefully.\n\nI see: \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus.\" and then later, \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not there. Instead, I have \"talmpus is diqtpus.\" and \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is absent.\n\nBut in the information, there is: \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" might be a mistake? Let's look at the given text.\n\nThe given information says: \"xivcpus is rucypus and suwlpus. xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus.\"\n\nSo two statements about xivcpus: it is contained in rucypus and suwlpus, and also in vuyjpus and wezbpus.\n\nThen later, we have \"talmpus is diqtpus.\" and no \"vuyjpus is talmpus\".\n\nSo vuyjpus is a category that contains xivcpus, but we don't know what contains vuyjpus or what it is contained in.\n\nSimilarly, we have \"fidypus\" from \"gevgpus is fidypus\" but no further information on fidypus.\n\nSo for x, since it is in gevgpus, which is in xivcpus, which is in vuyjpus, but vuyjpus is not connected to anything else that might lead to babmpus.\n\nNow, another aspect: from \"gevgpus is fidypus\" but fidypus is not defined further, so we don't know what fidypus is.\n\nSo it seems that from x, we can go to gevgpus, to xivcpus, to vuyjpus, but then stop because vuyjpus is not defined further.\n\nSimilarly, to wezbpus, rucypus, suwlpus, but none of them are connected to babmpus.\n\nBut earlier I traced a long chain from lutfpus to many other things, but that chain doesn't connect to x.\n\nSo how can x be related to babmpus?\n\nPerhaps from other paths.\n\nNotice that in the information, there is \"lutfpus is babmpus and lepspus\" and \"satnpus is lutfpus\" and \"xojjpus is satnpus and cuzdpus\" but also \"satnpus is tonxpus\" from \"satnpus is tonxpus\"? Let's see: from \"xojjpus is satnpus and cuzdpus\" and \"satnpus is tonxpus\" is not stated directly.\n\nFrom \"satnpus is lutfpus\" so satnpus is contained in lutfpus.\n\nBut also, from \"tonxpus is vamtpus\" and \"satnpus is tonxpus\" is not said. Instead, from \"xojjpus is satnpus and cuzdpus\" and \"qibqpus is xojjpus\" etc., but we need to see if satnpus is connected to x.\n\nx is in gevgpus, which is in xivcpus, but is xivcpus connected to satnpus?\n\nFrom the information, we have \"xivcpus is rucypus and suwlpus\" but no connection to satnpus.\n\nPerhaps from another angle.\n\nWhat about fidypus? gevgpus is fidypus, but fidypus is not defined, so no help.\n\nMaybe from the fact that xivcpus is also contained in other things, but from the statements, only those mentioned.\n\nLet's list all categories that contain xivcpus: from \"xivcpus is rucypus and suwlpus\" and \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus\", so xivcpus is contained in rucypus, suwlpus, vuyjpus, wezbpus.\n\nBut none of these are connected to babmpus.\n\nSo it seems that x is not in the chain that leads to babmpus.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any indirect connection.\n\nNotice that in the long chain I traced from lutfpus, it goes through many categories to pawlpus and others, but that chain starts from lutfpus and goes down to specific things, but x is in gevgpus, which is in xivcpus, which is in vuyjpus, etc., and vuyjpus might be related to something else.\n\nBut from the information, there is no statement that links vuyjpus to any other category except that it contains xivcpus.\n\nSimilarly, wezbpus is not linked.\n\nSo for x to be in babmpus, there must be a path from gevgpus to babmpus, but there isn't any.\n\nPerhaps from fidypus, but fidypus is not defined, so unknown.\n\nBut the question is about x being babbpus or babmpus or babnpus.\n\nSince babbpus and babnpus are not mentioned at all, it is false that x is in them, or unknown? But since they are not defined, likely x is not in them, so for babmpus, since it is defined but no connection, x is not in babmpus.\n\nBut let's see if there is a way.\n\nAnother thought: from \"lutfpus is babmpus\" so if x is in lutfpus, then x is in babmpus.\n\nBut is x in lutfpus? lutfpus is contained in satnpus? No, from \"satnpus is lutfpus\" so satnpus is contained in lutfpus, so lutfpus is a broader category that contains satnpus.\n\nSo for x to be in lutfpus, x must be in satnpus or something contained in lutfpus.\n\nBut from the chain, satnpus is contained in xojjpus, etc., but x is in gevgpus, which is not connected to satnpus.\n\nIs there any common category?\n\nNotice that from \"talmpus is diqtpus\" and \"diqtpus is fubbpus\" etc., but talmpus is not connected to vuyjpus.\n\nBut in the information, there is \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not stated, so no connection.\n\nPerhaps I missed a statement.\n\nLet's read the information very carefully.\n\nI see: \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus.\" and then later, \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not there. But after that, I have \"talmpus is diqtpus.\" so talmpus is contained in diqtpus? No, \"talmpus is diqtpus\" means talmpus belongs to diqtpus, so talmpus is contained in diqtpus.\n\nSo diqtpus is a category that contains talmpus.\n\nBut still, no link to vuyjpus.\n\nSo unless there is \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" but it is not given.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, there is no path from x to babmpus.\n\nSimilarly for babbpus and babnpus, they are not mentioned, so x cannot be in them.\n\nThus, it is false that x is babbpus or babmpus or babnpus.\n\nBut let's make sure about babmpus. Is there any other mention?\n\nbabmpus is only in \"lutfpus is babmpus and lepspus\" so babmpus contains lutfpus.\n\nBut since x is not in lutfpus or any subset of lutfpus, x is not in babmpus.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\nSo the answer should be false.\n\nBut the question is \"is it true or false or unknown?\" and since we can conclude false, it should be false.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that x might be in babmpus through another path, but from the information, it is not possible.\n\nSo I think it's false.",
  "thinking_text": "First, I need to find out what x is. From the given information, it says: \"x is gevgpus.\" So, x belongs to gevgpus.\n\nNow, I need to see if x is babbpus or babmpus or babnpus.

Since x is gevgpus, I need to see if gevgpus is equivalent to or contains one of these, but the question is about x being those, so if gevgpus is one of them, then x would be, but from the \"is\" meaning, it might be that gevgpus is a category that includes x, but x is an instance, so if gevgpus is babbpus, then x is babbpus because x is gevgpus.\n\nBut let's see the definitions. The note says: \"'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', not that A equals B.\" So when we say \"x is gevgpus\", it means x is contained in gevgpus, so gevgpus is a category that contains x. Similarly, when we say \"gevgpus is xivcpus and fidypus\", it means gevgpus is contained in xivcpus and also contained in fidypus? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe note says: \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B or A is contained in B. So if A is B, then B is a category, and A is a member or subset of B.\n\nBut in the statements, sometimes it says \"A is B and C\", which might mean A is contained in B and also contained in C, or it might mean that B and C are categories that A belongs to.\n\nI think I need to interpret each statement as defining relationships.\n\nLet me take an example from the information: \"pawlpus is dezvpus.\" So pawlpus belongs to dezvpus.\n\n\"citfpus is nudvpus and yimcpus.\" So citfpus belongs to nudvpus and also to yimcpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"cosgpus is fiqrpus and wuxgpus\" so cosgpus belongs to fiqrpus and wuxgpus.\n\nSo in general, \"A is B\" means A is a subset of B or A is an instance of B.\n\nFor the question, \"x is babbpus or babmpus or babnpus?\" we need to see if x is contained in any of these categories.\n\nSince x is contained in gevgpus, I need to find out what gevgpus is contained in, and so on, until I see if it connects to babbpus, etc.\n\nBut I also need to see if x is directly one of them, but since x is given as gevgpus, probably gevgpus is a category, and x is an instance, so I need to find the hierarchy.\n\nActually, from the information, we have many such statements, and I need to find a path to babbpus, babmpus, or babnpus.\n\nFirst, let's list all relevant statements for x.\n\nx is gevgpus.\n\ngevgpus is xivcpus and fidypus. So gevgpus belongs to xivcpus and to fidypus. That means x is in gevgpus, so x is also in xivcpus and fidypus? Not necessarily. If gevgpus is contained in xivcpus, then every member of gevgpus is also in xivcpus, so since x is in gevgpus, x is in xivcpus. Similarly for fidypus.\n\nSo from \"gevgpus is xivcpus\" meaning gevgpus ⊆ xivcpus, so x ∈ gevgpus ⊆ xivcpus, so x ∈ xivcpus.\n\nSimilarly, gevgpus is fidypus, so x ∈ fidypus.\n\nBut for the question, we need x to be in babbpus or etc.\n\nSo I need to find if xivcpus or fidypus is related to babbpus, etc.\n\nNow, let's look at xivcpus. From information: \"xivcpus is rucypus and suwlpus.\" Also, \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus.\" There are multiple statements about xivcpus.\n\nThis might be messy. I need to organize the data.\n\nSince the question is about babbpus or babmpus or babnpus, I should look for those terms in the information.\n\nI see \"babmpus\" mentioned in one place: \"lutfpus is babmpus and lepspus.\" So babmpus is a category that lutfpus belongs to.\n\nBut lutfpus is mentioned elsewhere: \"satnpus is lutfpus.\" and \"xojjpus is satnpus and cuzdpus.\" and \"qibqpus is xojjpus.\" etc.\n\nBut we need x to be babmpus, meaning x should be contained in babmpus.\n\nSimilarly, babbpus and babnpus are not directly mentioned in the information, as far as I can see. Let me search for \"babbpus\" and \"babnpus\" in the text.\n\nI don't see \"babbpus\" or \"babnpus\" anywhere in the given information. I only see \"babmpus\" in \"lutfpus is babmpus and lepspus.\"\n\nSo for babbpus and babnpus, since they are not mentioned, it is likely that x is not contained in them, but we need to confirm if x is babmpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus or babmpus or babnpus?\" so if x is not any of them, it might be false or unknown.\n\nBut since babbpus and babnpus are not defined, probably x is not in them, but we need to see for babmpus.\n\nSo let's focus on whether x is in babmpus.\n\nSince x is in gevgpus, and gevgpus is in xivcpus, etc., I need to see if xivcpus or any of its ancestors are connected to babmpus.\n\nFrom the information, we have \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus.\" and \"vuyjpus is talmpus.\" from \"vuyjpus is talmpus.\"? Let's see: \"vuyjpus is talmpus.\" is not directly stated, but from \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus\" and then \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" ? No, I need to find what vuyjpus is.\n\nFrom the information: \"vuyjpus is talmpus.\" is not said. Instead, I see \"talmpus is diqtpus.\" and \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not stated.\n\nLet's list all statements involving vuyjpus.\n\nFrom the information: \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus.\" This means xivcpus is contained in vuyjpus and in wezbpus? Or does it mean that vuyjpus and wezbpus are categories that xivcpus belongs to?\n\nAccording to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if \"xivcpus is vuyjpus\", it means xivcpus is contained in vuyjpus, so vuyjpus is a broader category.\n\nSimilarly, \"xivcpus is wezbpus\" so xivcpus is contained in wezbpus.\n\nBut also, from earlier, \"gevgpus is xivcpus\" so gevggpus is contained in xivcpus, so since xivcpus is contained in vuyjpus, then gevgpus is contained in vuyjpus, and thus x is in vuyjpus.\n\nSimilarly, from \"xivcpus is rucypus and suwlpus\" so xivcpus is contained in rucypus and in suwlpus.\n\nSo let's trace the containment.\n\nNow, for vuyjpus, what is it? Is vuyjpus contained in something else? Or is it a category that contains other things?\n\nFrom the information, I see \"vuyjpus is talmpus.\"? No, I don't see that. Let's read carefully.\n\nI see: \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not stated. Instead, I see: \"talmpus is diqtpus.\" and also from \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus\" but no direct statement about vuyjpus being something else.\n\nBut later, I see: \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not there. Let's list all statements from the information.\n\nI need to parse the information step by step.\n\nPerhaps I should list all the \"is\" statements in a structured way.\n\nBut that might take too long. Since the question is about x and babmpus, I should find a path to babmpus.\n\nbabmpus is mentioned only in \"lutfpus is babmpus and lepspus.\"\n\nSo lutfpus is contained in babmpus.\n\nSo if x is contained in lutfpus, then x would be in babmpus, but x is in gevgpus, so I need to see if gevgpus is contained in lutfpus or if there is a chain from gevgpus to lutfpus.\n\nlutfpus is also mentioned in \"satnpus is lutfpus.\" so satnpus is contained in lutfpus.\n\nAnd \"xojjpus is satnpus and cuzdpus.\" so xojjpus is contained in satnpus and cuzdpus.\n\nAnd \"qibqpus is xojjpus.\" so qibqpus is contained in xojjpus.\n\nAnd \"gonspus is qibqpus and qalypus.\" so gonspus is contained in qibqpus and qalypus.\n\nAnd \"ravnpus is gonspus and norgpus.\" so ravnpus is contained in gonspus and norgpus.\n\nAnd \"gapjpus is ravnpus.\" so gapjpus is contained in ravnpus.\n\nAnd \"zoyspus is gapjpus and kujwpus.\" so zoyspus is contained in gapjpus and kujwpus.\n\nAnd \"wonypus is zoyspus.\" so wonypus is contained in zoyspus.\n\nAnd \"zujtpus is wonypus.\" so zujtpus is contained in wonypus.\n\nAnd \"detppus is zujtpus.\" so detppus is contained in zujtpus.\n\nAnd \"kekxpus is detppus and muyypus.\" so kekxpus is contained in detppus and muyypus.\n\nAnd \"buyqpus is kekxpus and sawzpus.\" so buyqpus is contained in kekxpus and sawzpus.\n\nAnd \"giflpus is buyqpus.\" so giflpus is contained in buyqpus.\n\nAnd \"nuzqpus is giflpus and qovnpus.\" so nuzqpus is contained in giflpus and qovnpus.\n\nAnd \"waqwpus is nuzqpus and suhhpus.\" so waqwpus is contained in nuzqpus and suhhpus.\n\nAnd \"lullpus is waqwpus.\" so lullpus is contained in waqwpus.\n\nAnd \"letppus is lullpus.\" so letppus is contained in lullpus.\n\nAnd \"suhrpus is letppus.\" so suhrpus is contained in letppus.\n\nAnd \"yoqvpus is suhrpus and peyypus.\" so yoqvpus is contained in suhrpus and peyypus.\n\nAnd \"mojkpus is yoqvpus.\" so mojkpus is contained in yoqvpus.\n\nAnd \"fesnpus is mojkpus and yipspus and yidtpus.\" so fesnpus is contained in mojkpus, yipspus, and yidtpus.\n\nAnd \"kijppus is fesnpus and zomhpus.\" so kijppus is contained in fesnpus and zomhpus.\n\nAnd \"yiywpus is kijppus and tatjpus.\" so yiywpus is contained in kijppus and tatjpus.\n\nAnd \"sochpus is yiywpus.\" so sochpus is contained in yiywpus.\n\nAnd \"bihnpus is sochpus.\" so bihnpus is contained in sochpus.\n\nAnd \"qanrpus is bihnpus.\" so qanrpus is contained in bihnpus.\n\nAnd \"nepspus is qanrpus and qupspus.\" so nepspus is contained in qanrpus and qupspus.\n\nAnd \"beywpus is nepspus.\" so beywpus is contained in nepspus.\n\nAnd \"kefspus is beywpus.\" so kefspus is contained in beywpus.\n\nAnd \"faldpus is kefspus and ruqgpus and gerzpus.\" so faldpus is contained in kefspus, ruqgpus, and gerzpus.\n\nAnd \"jajmpus is falbpus.\" and \"fiqtpus is jajmpus.\" but we have \"jiyfpus is fiqtpus.\" and \"fizxpus is jiyfpus.\" and \"waffpus is fizxpus.\" and \"wehrpus is waffpus.\" and \"jafrpus is wehrpus and vogkpus.\" and \"duplpus is jafrpus and legxpus.\" and \"lomkpus is duplpus.\" and \"vakkpus is lomkpus and tazzpus and qidjpus.\" and \"dolspus is vakkpus.\" and \"javcpus is dolspus and pohxpus.\" and \"dezvpus is javcpus.\" and \"pawlpus is dezvpus.\" and \"hixdpus is pawlpus and vewkpus and hehrpus.\" and \"resvpus is hixdpus.\" and \"bugqpus is resvpus.\" and \"paqbpus is bugqpus and neddpus.\" and \"gimvpus is paqbpus.\" and \"xajbpus is gimvpus and gofypus.\" and \"fazppus is xajbpus.\" and \"pupmpus is fazppus and yanlpus and sekmpus.\" and \"rabwpus is pupmpus.\" and \"paywpus is rabwpus.\" and \"tigqpus is paywpus and nokcpus and masmpus and jucxpus.\" and \"mochpus is tigqpus.\" and \"nazjpus is mochpus.\" and \"lanfpus is nazjpus and tukppus and yakcpus.\" and \"fowypus is lanfpus and yuxdpus.\" and \"gawbpus is fowypus and kijbpus and bedgpus.\" and \"ketvpus is gawbpus.\" and \"vedlpus is ketvpus.\" and \"jacvpus is vedlpus and qovwpus.\" and \"sirmpus is jacvpus.\" and \"nudvpus is sirmpus and bahmpus.\" and \"citfpus is nudvpus and yimcpus.\" and \"wohypus is citfpus and xivhpus.\" and \"kagkpus is wohypus.\" and \"fethpus is kagkpus.\" and \"ceqxpus is fethpus.\" and \"yajnpus is ceqxpus.\" and \"tuvqpus is yajnpus.\" and \"givspus is tuvqpus.\" and \"zosfpus is givspus.\"? No, from \"givspus is tuvqpus\" so givspus is contained in tuvqpus, and \"zosfpus is givspus\" is not stated, but from \"zugppus is givspus and sawtpus\" and \"kipjpus is zugppus and dibjpus\" and \"qonppus is kipjpus\" and \"fiqrpus is maqcpus and mafnpus\" and \"cosgpus is fiqrpus and wuxgpus\" and \"rumjpus is cosgpus\" and \"tutrpus is rumjpus\" and \"sojppus is tutrpus\" and \"qiqqpus is sojppus\" and \"sajnpus is qiqqpus\" and \"pewzpus is sajnpus\" and \"dufmpus is pewzpus\" and \"mugbpus is dufmpus\" and \"zuwrpus is mugbpus and jotmpus\" and \"zasvpus is zuwrpus\" and also \"zasvpus is fejwpus and qorxpus\" and \"wahmpus is zasvpus and fikwpus\" and \"fubbpus is wahmpus and rapcpus\" and \"diqtpus is fubbpus\" and \"talmpus is diqtpus\" and from earlier, we have \"vuyjpus is talmpus\"? No, I don't have that.\n\nI think I missed something. In the beginning, I have \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus\" but I need to know what vuyjpus is.\n\nFrom the information, there is no statement that vuyjpus is something else. Similarly, wezbpus is not defined further.\n\nBut from \"gevgpus is xivcpus\" so x is in xivcpus, and xivcpus is in vuyjpus, so x is in vuyjpus.\n\nBut vuyjpus is not connected to talmpus directly.\n\nHowever, I see \"talmpus is diqtpus\" and \"diqtpus is fubbpus\" etc., but no link to vuyjpus.\n\nBut wait, I recall that in the list, there is \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not stated, but let's read the information again carefully.\n\nI see: \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus.\" and then later, \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not there. Instead, I have \"talmpus is diqtpus.\" and \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is absent.\n\nBut in the information, there is: \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" might be a mistake? Let's look at the given text.\n\nThe given information says: \"xivcpus is rucypus and suwlpus. xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus.\"\n\nSo two statements about xivcpus: it is contained in rucypus and suwlpus, and also in vuyjpus and wezbpus.\n\nThen later, we have \"talmpus is diqtpus.\" and no \"vuyjpus is talmpus\".\n\nSo vuyjpus is a category that contains xivcpus, but we don't know what contains vuyjpus or what it is contained in.\n\nSimilarly, we have \"fidypus\" from \"gevgpus is fidypus\" but no further information on fidypus.\n\nSo for x, since it is in gevgpus, which is in xivcpus, which is in vuyjpus, but vuyjpus is not connected to anything else that might lead to babmpus.\n\nNow, another aspect: from \"gevgpus is fidypus\" but fidypus is not defined further, so we don't know what fidypus is.\n\nSo it seems that from x, we can go to gevgpus, to xivcpus, to vuyjpus, but then stop because vuyjpus is not defined further.\n\nSimilarly, to wezbpus, rucypus, suwlpus, but none of them are connected to babmpus.\n\nBut earlier I traced a long chain from lutfpus to many other things, but that chain doesn't connect to x.\n\nSo how can x be related to babmpus?\n\nPerhaps from other paths.\n\nNotice that in the information, there is \"lutfpus is babmpus and lepspus\" and \"satnpus is lutfpus\" and \"xojjpus is satnpus and cuzdpus\" but also \"satnpus is tonxpus\" from \"satnpus is tonxpus\"? Let's see: from \"xojjpus is satnpus and cuzdpus\" and \"satnpus is tonxpus\" is not stated directly.\n\nFrom \"satnpus is lutfpus\" so satnpus is contained in lutfpus.\n\nBut also, from \"tonxpus is vamtpus\" and \"satnpus is tonxpus\" is not said. Instead, from \"xojjpus is satnpus and cuzdpus\" and \"qibqpus is xojjpus\" etc., but we need to see if satnpus is connected to x.\n\nx is in gevgpus, which is in xivcpus, but is xivcpus connected to satnpus?\n\nFrom the information, we have \"xivcpus is rucypus and suwlpus\" but no connection to satnpus.\n\nPerhaps from another angle.\n\nWhat about fidypus? gevgpus is fidypus, but fidypus is not defined, so no help.\n\nMaybe from the fact that xivcpus is also contained in other things, but from the statements, only those mentioned.\n\nLet's list all categories that contain xivcpus: from \"xivcpus is rucypus and suwlpus\" and \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus\", so xivcpus is contained in rucypus, suwlpus, vuyjpus, wezbpus.\n\nBut none of these are connected to babmpus.\n\nSo it seems that x is not in the chain that leads to babmpus.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any indirect connection.\n\nNotice that in the long chain I traced from lutfpus, it goes through many categories to pawlpus and others, but that chain starts from lutfpus and goes down to specific things, but x is in gevgpus, which is in xivcpus, which is in vuyjpus, etc., and vuyjpus might be related to something else.\n\nBut from the information, there is no statement that links vuyjpus to any other category except that it contains xivcpus.\n\nSimilarly, wezbpus is not linked.\n\nSo for x to be in babmpus, there must be a path from gevgpus to babmpus, but there isn't any.\n\nPerhaps from fidypus, but fidypus is not defined, so unknown.\n\nBut the question is about x being babbpus or babmpus or babnpus.\n\nSince babbpus and babnpus are not mentioned at all, it is false that x is in them, or unknown? But since they are not defined, likely x is not in them, so for babmpus, since it is defined but no connection, x is not in babmpus.\n\nBut let's see if there is a way.\n\nAnother thought: from \"lutfpus is babmpus\" so if x is in lutfpus, then x is in babmpus.\n\nBut is x in lutfpus? lutfpus is contained in satnpus? No, from \"satnpus is lutfpus\" so satnpus is contained in lutfpus, so lutfpus is a broader category that contains satnpus.\n\nSo for x to be in lutfpus, x must be in satnpus or something contained in lutfpus.\n\nBut from the chain, satnpus is contained in xojjpus, etc., but x is in gevgpus, which is not connected to satnpus.\n\nIs there any common category?\n\nNotice that from \"talmpus is diqtpus\" and \"diqtpus is fubbpus\" etc., but talmpus is not connected to vuyjpus.\n\nBut in the information, there is \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not stated, so no connection.\n\nPerhaps I missed a statement.\n\nLet's read the information very carefully.\n\nI see: \"xivcpus is vuyjpus and wezbpus.\" and then later, \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" is not there. But after that, I have \"talmpus is diqtpus.\" so talmpus is contained in diqtpus? No, \"talmpus is diqtpus\" means talmpus belongs to diqtpus, so talmpus is contained in diqtpus.\n\nSo diqtpus is a category that contains talmpus.\n\nBut still, no link to vuyjpus.\n\nSo unless there is \"vuyjpus is talmpus\" but it is not given.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, there is no path from x to babmpus.\n\nSimilarly for babbpus and babnpus, they are not mentioned, so x cannot be in them.\n\nThus, it is false that x is babbpus or babmpus or babnpus.\n\nBut let's make sure about babmpus. Is there any other mention?\n\nbabmpus is only in \"lutfpus is babmpus and lepspus\" so babmpus contains lutfpus.\n\nBut since x is not in lutfpus or any subset of lutfpus, x is not in babmpus.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\nSo the answer should be false.\n\nBut the question is \"is it true or false or unknown?\" and since we can conclude false, it should be false.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that x might be in babmpus through another path, but from the information, it is not possible.\n\nSo I think it's false.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo I think it's false.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

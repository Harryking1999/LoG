So babgpus is a category that includes cumgpus.\n\nNow, I need to see if x is connected to cumgpus or babgpus through other relationships.\n\nLet me list out all the relationships from the given information:\n\n- laylpus is sapdpus.\n\n- ziccpus is xechpus and kavkpus.\n\n- budtpus is ziccpus and fonppus and jewnpus.\n\n- x is budtpus and siqxpus.\n\n- cumgpus is babgpus and juddpus and vucppus.\n\n- xechpus is rahspus.\n\n- fokxpus is veyvpus and tudxpus.\n\n- voybpus is yovlpus.\n\n- rahspus is kiyzpus and jiwfpus and qayjpus.\n\n- kiyzpus is circpus and kukmpus.\n\n- yiyppus is fokxpus.\n\n- sapdpus is yiyppus.\n\n- bitvpus is voybpus.\n\n- circpus is sasfpus.\n\n- bitvpus is laylpus.\n\n- sasfpus is bitvpus.\n\n- veyvpus is cumgpus.\n\nI need to find a path from x to babgpus.\n\nx is budtpus. budtpus is ziccpus and fonppus and jewnpus. So x is also ziccpus through budtpus.\n\nziccpus is xechpus and kavkpus. So x is xechpus through ziccpus.\n\nxechpus is rahspus. So x is rahspus through xechpus.\n\nrahspus is kiyzpus and jiwfpus and qayjpus. So x is kiyzpus through rahspus.\n\nkiyzpus is circpus and kukmpus. So x is circpus through kiyzpus.\n\ncircpus is sasfpus. So x is sasfpus through circpus.\n\nsasfpus is bitvpus. So x is bitvpus through sasfpus.\n\nbitvpus is voybpus and also bitvpus is laylpus. From above, bitvpus is voybpus, and voybpus is yovlpus, but that might not be relevant yet.\n\nAlso, bitvpus is laylpus. laylpus is sapdpus. sapdpus is yiyppus. yiyppus is fokxpus. fokxpus is veyvpus and tudxpus. veyvpus is cumgpus. cumgpus is babgpus and juddpus and vucppus.\n\nSo, from x, I have a path to bitvpus, and from bitvpus to laylpus, to sapdpus, to yiyppus, to fokxpus, to veyvpus, to cumgpus, to babgpus.\n\nTherefore, x is connected to babgpus through this chain.\n\nBut let me verify if this chain is valid.\n\nWe have:\n\nx is budtpus → budtpus is ziccpus → ziccpus is xechpus → xechpus is rahspus → rahspus is kiyzpus → kiyzpus is circpus → circpus is sasfpus → sasfpus is bitvpus → bitvpus is laylpus → laylpus is sapdpus → sapdpus is yiyppus → yiyppus is fokxpus → fokxpus is veyvpus → veyvpus is cumgpus → cumgpus is babgpus.\n\nSo, since x is bitvpus (through the chain), and bitvpus leads to babgpus, then x is babgpus.\n\nBut is this direct? The question is whether x is babgpus, meaning x belongs to babgpus.\n\nIn the chain, x is cumgpus through veyvpus, fokxpus, etc., and cumgpus is babgpus, so yes, x should be babgpus.\n\nI also have another path? From bitvpus, we have bitvpus is voybpus, but voybpus is yovlpus, which doesn't seem to connect to babgpus, so the path through laylpus is the one that connects.\n\nAlso, from the given, we have \"bitvpus is laylpus\" and \"sasfpus is bitvpus\" and \"circpus is sasfpus\" etc., so the chain seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, it should be true that x is babgpus.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any contradictions or missing links.\n\nWe have x is budtpus, and budtpus is ziccpus, which is correct.\n\nziccpus is xechpus, which is rahspus, etc.\n\nAlso, note that from rahspus, we have kiyzpus, which is circpus, and circpus is sasfpus, and sasfpus is bitvpus, which is confirmed.\n\nThen bitvpus is laylpus, and laylpus is sapdpus, sapdpus is yiyppus, yiyppus is fokxpus, fokxpus is veyvpus, veyvpus is cumgpus, cumgpus is babgpus.\n\nSo all links are present.\n\nTherefore, x is babgpus.\n\nSo the answer should be true.",

Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nTherefore, x is babgpus.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

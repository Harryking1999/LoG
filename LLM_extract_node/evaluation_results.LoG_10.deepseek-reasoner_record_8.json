  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is babgpus, babkpus, or babmpus. The given information tells me that x is dabfpus, from the statement: \"x is dabfpus.\" So, x belongs to dabfpus.\n\nNow, I need to see if dabfpus is connected to any of these: babgpus, babkpus, or babmpus. Looking through the information, I see mentions of babkpus. Specifically, \"cilcpus is babkpus and yemlpus.\" But I need to see if dabfpus leads to babkpus or the others.\n\nLet me list out all the relationships step by step. I should start from x and follow the chain.\n\nx is dabfpus.\n\nNow, what is dabfpus? From \"dabfpus is yiqgpus and hohbpus.\" So dabfpus belongs to yiqgpus and hohbpus. But since we're interested in categories, I need to see where yiqgpus or hohbpus leads.\n\nNext, yiqgpus is yifdpus and xewzpus. So yiqgpus belongs to yifdpus and xewzpus.\n\nyifdpus is tuwxpus and kukqpus.\n\ntuwxpus is codqpus.\n\ncodqpus is tojfpus.\n\ntojfpus is gabtpus, but also from other statements: tojfpus is hisnpus, and tojfpus is rexjpus. So tojfpus belongs to multiple categories.\n\nBut I need to get to babkpus. I recall that cilcpus is babkpus, so if I can connect to cilcpus, that might help.\n\nLet me see if there's a path from tojfpus to cilcpus.\n\ntojfpus is rexjpus? From \"tojfpus is rexjpus\" – wait, no, let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the information: \"tojfpus is gabtpus.\" but also \"tojfpus is hisnpus.\" and \"tojfpus is rexjpus.\"? I think I misread.\n\nLooking back: \"tojfpus is gabtpus.\" – that's one statement.\n\nThen \"hiwrpus is gehnpus.\" – not related directly.\n\n\"tuwxpus is codqpus.\" – already have.\n\n\"codqpus is tojfpus.\" – so codqpus is tojfpus, meaning codqpus belongs to tojfpus.\n\nBut from yifdpus is tuwxpus and kukqpus, and tuwxpus is codqpus, so tuwxpus belongs to codqpus, and codqpus belongs to tojfpus, so indirectly, yifdpus belongs to tojfpus? But since it's \"is\" meaning belongs to, we have to follow the hierarchy.\n\nPerhaps I should list all statements in a way that I can trace categories.\n\nI see that cilcpus is mentioned multiple times. \"femgpus is cilcpus.\" and \"cilcpus is deztpus.\" and \"cilcpus is babkpus and yemlpus.\" so cilcpus belongs to babkpus, among others.\n\nSo if I can find if x is connected to cilcpus.\n\nx is dabfpus, which is yiqgpus, which is yifdpus, which is tuwxpus, which is codqpus, which is tojfpus.\n\nNow, tojfpus is what? From the statements: \"tojfpus is gabtpus.\" but also \"tojfpus is hisnpus.\" and \"tojfpus is rexjpus.\"? Let's see the text.\n\nFrom the given information: \"tojfpus is gabtpus.\" – that's one.\n\nThen later: \"tojfpus is hisnpus.\" – oh, from \"tojfpus is hisnpus.\"? Wait, where is that? Let's read carefully.\n\nThe text says: \"tojfpus is gabtpus.\" and then \"hiwrpus is gehnpus.\" etc. But I think I missed something.\n\nLet's list all statements involving tojfpus.\n\nFrom the text: \"tojfpus is gabtpus.\" – this is directly stated.\n\nThen: \"codqpus is tojfpus.\" – so codqpus belongs to tojfpus.\n\nAlso, from \"tojfpus is hisnpus.\"? I don't see that in the text. Let's read the text again.\n\nThe text says: \"tojfpus is gabtpus.\" and then \"hiwrpus is gehnpus.\" – no mention of tojfpus is hisnpus here.\n\nPerhaps I misread. Let's look at the full text.\n\nFrom the given information: \"tojfpus is gabtpus.\" – yes.\n\nThen later: \"ribrpus is lazvpus and cisdpus and xuswpus.\" – not tojfpus.\n\n\"tojfpus is hisnpus.\" – is this stated? Let's see: after \"ribrpus is...\" there is \"tojfpus is hisnpus.\"? No, in the text it says: \"tojfpus is hisnpus.\"? Let's read the text carefully.\n\nHere is the relevant part: \"laxppus is huhqpus. yeqypus is jozmpus and vihnpus. gekdpus is wizbpus and qemcpus. cilcpus is deztpus. rexjpus is zomspus. quhtpus is gekdpus. lazvpus is yoywpus and holcpus. rimspus is kacbpus and nesjpus. zomspus is fihppus. kacbpus is cadnpus. lighpus is bivmpus. cilcpus is babkpus and yemlpus. zowzpus is rujmpus. wizbpus is laxppus and kewvpus. lutypus is peckpus. tojfpus is gabtpus. hiwrpus is gehnpus. tuwxpus is codqpus. ribrpus is lazvpus and cisdpus and xuswpus. tojfpus is hisnpus. cadnpus is tojjpus. tojfpus is rexjpus. peckpus is ciqtpus. hogbpus is lutypus. xurkpus is zayspus. cilcpus is fowjpus and tayhpus. yiqgpus is yifdpus and xewzpus. huhqpus is hiwrpus. x is dabfpus. xibqpus is femgpus. yifdpus is tuwxpus and kukqpus. connpus is gilgpus and melxpus. nekppus is jeycpus and zihtpus. jeycpus is jedmpus. bivmpus is sixqpus and taycpus. codqpus is tojfpus. fihppus is xurkpus. jedmpus is connpus and poyzpus. jezqpus is jimypus. dabfpus is yiqgpus and hohbpus. gehnpus is fojbpus. fojbpus is hogbpus and vidgpus.\"\n\nSo from this, I see \"tojfpus is gabtpus.\" and then later \"tojfpus is hisnpus.\"? No, after \"ribrpus is lazvpus and cisdpus and xuswpus.\" there is no \"tojfpus is hisnpus\". Let's see the sequence: \"ribrpus is lazvpus and cisdpus and xuswpus. tojfpus is hisnpus.\" – oh! yes, it is there: \"tojfpus is hisnpus.\" So tojfpus is also hisnpus.\n\nThen later: \"cadnpus is tojjpus. tojfpus is rexjpus.\" so tojfpus is also rexjpus.\n\nSo tojfpus belongs to gabtpus, hisnpus, and rexjpus.\n\nNow, from codqpus is tojfpus, so codqpus belongs to tojfpus, which means codqpus is also under those categories, but since tojfpus belongs to multiple, codqpus belongs to tojfpus, so it is part of tojfpus, but tojfpus itself belongs to gabtpus, etc.\n\nFor our purpose, we need to find if x is babkpus.\n\nbabkpus is a category that cilcpus belongs to, as per \"cilcpus is babkpus and yemlpus.\"\n\nSo we need to see if x is cilcpus or connected to cilcpus.\n\nx is dabfpus, which is yiqgpus, which is yifdpus, which is tuwxpus, which is codqpus, which is tojfpus.\n\nNow, tojfpus is rexjpus? From \"tojfpus is rexjpus\", so tojfpus belongs to rexjpus.\n\nrexjpus is zomspus? From \"rexjpus is zomspus.\"\n\nzomspus is fihppus? From \"zomspus is fihppus.\"\n\nfihppus is xurkpus?

From \"lazvpus is yoywpus and holcpus.\"\n\nyoywpus is lighpus and dusdpus and pusbpus? From \"yoywpus is lighpus and dusdpus and pusbpus.\"\n\nlighpus is bivmpus? From \"lighpus is bivmpus.\"\n\nbivmpus is sixqpus and taycpus? From \"bivmpus is sixqpus and taycpus.\"\n\nsixqpus is wamfpus and nonypus? From \"sixqpus is wamfpus and nonypus.\"\n\nwamfpus is zowzpus? From \"wamfpus is zowzpus.\"\n\nzowzpus is rujmpus? From \"zowzpus is rujmpus.\"\n\nrujmpus is quhtpus? From \"rujmpus is quhtpus.\"\n\nquhtpus is gekdpus? From \"quhtpus is gekdpus.\"\n\ngekdpus is wizbpus and qemcpus? From \"gekdpus is wizbpus and qemcpus.\"\n\nwizbpus is laxppus and kewvpus? From \"wizbpus is laxppus and kewvpus.\"\n\nlaxppus is huhqpus? From \"laxppus is huhqpus.\"\n\nhuhqpus is hiwrpus? From \"huhqpus is hiwrpus.\"\n\nhiwrpus is gehnpus? From \"hiwrpus is gehnpus.\"\n\ngehnpus is fojbpus? From \"gehnpus is fojbpus.\"\n\nfojbpus is hogbpus and vidgpus? From \"fojbpus is hogbpus and vidgpus.\"\n\nhogbpus is lutypus? From \"hogbpus is lutypus.\"\n\nlutypus is peckpus? From \"lutypus is peckpus.\"\n\npeckpus is ciqtpus? From \"peckpus is ciqtpus.\"\n\nciqtpus is xibqpus? From \"ciqtpus is xibqpus.\"\n\nxibqpus is femgpus? From \"xibqpus is femgpus.\"\n\nfemgpus is cilcpus? From \"femgpus is cilcpus.\"\n\nAnd cilcpus is babkpus? From \"cilcpus is babkpus and yemlpus.\"\n\nSo, from this long chain, we have a path from tojfpus to cilcpus via rexjpus, zomspus, fihppus, xurkpus, zayspus, yeqypus, jozmpus, nekppus, jeycpus, jedmpus, connpus, gilgpus, rimspus, kacbpus, cadnpus, tojjpus, ribrpus, lazvpus, yoywpus, lighpus, bivmpus, sixqpus, wamfpus, zowzpus, rujmpus, quhtpus, gekdpus, wizbpus, laxppus, huhqpus, hiwrpus, gehnpus, fojbpus, hogbpus, lutypus, peckpus, ciqtpus, xibqpus, femgpus, to cilcpus.\n\nBut this is from tojfpus, and we have tojfpus from codqpus, which is from tuwxpus, etc., back to x.\n\nSo, since x is dabfpus, and dabfpus is yiqgpus, and yiqgpus is yifdpus, and yifdpus is tuwxpus, and tuwxpus is codqpus, and codqpus is tojfpus, and tojfpus is rexjpus, and so on, eventually leading to cilcpus, which is babkpus.\n\nTherefore, x belongs to babkpus.\n\nThe question is whether x is babgpus or babkpus or babmpus. We have babkpus, so it is true that x is babkpus.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any other path or if this is correct.\n\nWe also have from tojfpus is gabtpus and hisnpus, but that might not lead to babkpus, but since we already have a path through rexjpus, it should be fine.\n\nAlso, note that tojfpus is rexjpus, so we used that.\n\nNow, is there any direct connection to babgpus or babmpus? From the information, I don't see any mention of babgpus or babmpus. Only babkpus is mentioned.\n\nSo, for babgpus and babmpus, since they are not in the information, we cannot say that x is them. But since x is babkpus, the question is \"x is babgpus or babkpus or babmpus?\" which is true because it is babkpus.\n\nThe question uses \"or\", so if any one of them is true, the statement is true.\n\nSo, since x is babkpus, it is true.\n\nBut let's make sure that the chain is correct.\n\nI recall that from cadnpus is tojjpus, and tojjpus is ribrpus and vepmpus, but we also have from kacbpus is cadnpus, etc.\n\nIn the chain, we have cadnpus is tojjpus, which is correct.\n\nAlso, from ribrpus, we have lazvpus, which is yoywpus, etc.\n\nAnd eventually to femgpus is cilcpus.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTo avoid missing, let's see if there is a shorter path.\n\nNotice that from yeqypus is jozmpus and vihnpus, but we used jozmpus to nekppus, etc.\n\nBut also, yeqypus is from zayspus, which is from xurkpus, etc.\n\nAnother thing: we have cilcpus is deztpus, and deztpus is hutkpus? From \"deztpus is hutkpus.\" but that might not be necessary since we need babkpus.\n\nAlso, from cilcpus is fowjpus and tayhpus, but again, not relevant.\n\nSo, the key is that we have a path from x to cilcpus to babkpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babkpus.\n\nSo, for the question, it is true that x is babkpus, so the \"or\" statement is true.\n\nThus, the answer should be true.\n\nBut the question is: \"Is it true or false or unknown: x is babgpus or babkpus or babmpus?\"\n\nSince x is babkpus, it is true.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's see if babgpus or babmpus are mentioned anywhere. From the given information, I don't see any reference to babgpus or babmpus. So, we don't know if x is them, but since x is babkpus, the \"or\" is satisfied.\n\nSo, final answer.",

From \"cilcpus is babkpus and yemlpus.\"\n\nSo, from this long chain, we have a path from tojfpus to cilcpus via rexjpus, zomspus, fihppus, xurkpus, zayspus, yeqypus, jozmpus, nekppus, jeycpus, jedmpus, connpus, gilgpus, rimspus, kacbpus, cadnpus, tojjpus, ribrpus, lazvpus, yoywpus, lighpus, bivmpus, sixqpus, wamfpus, zowzpus, rujmpus, quhtpus, gekdpus, wizbpus, laxppus, huhqpus, hiwrpus, gehnpus, fojbpus, hogbpus, lutypus, peckpus, ciqtpus, xibqpus, femgpus, to cilcpus.\n\nBut this is from tojfpus, and we have tojfpus from codqpus, which is from tuwxpus, etc., back to x.\n\nSo, since x is dabfpus, and dabfpus is yiqgpus, and yiqgpus is yifdpus, and yifdpus is tuwxpus, and tuwxpus is codqpus, and codqpus is tojfpus, and tojfpus is rexjpus, and so on, eventually leading to cilcpus, which is babkpus.\n\nTherefore, x belongs to babkpus.\n\nThe question is whether x is babgpus or babkpus or babmpus. We have babkpus, so it is true that x is babkpus.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any other path or if this is correct.\n\nWe also have from tojfpus is gabtpus and hisnpus, but that might not lead to babkpus, but since we already have a path through rexjpus, it should be fine.\n\nAlso, note that tojfpus is rexjpus, so we used that.\n\nNow, is there any direct connection to babgpus or babmpus? From the information, I don't see any mention of babgpus or babmpus. Only babkpus is mentioned.\n\nSo, for babgpus and babmpus, since they are not in the information, we cannot say that x is them. But since x is babkpus, the question is \"x is babgpus or babkpus or babmpus?\" which is true because it is babkpus.\n\nThe question uses \"or\", so if any one of them is true, the statement is true.\n\nSo, since x is babkpus, it is true.\n\nBut let's make sure that the chain is correct.\n\nI recall that from cadnpus is tojjpus, and tojjpus is ribrpus and vepmpus, but we also have from kacbpus is cadnpus, etc.\n\nIn the chain, we have cadnpus is tojjpus, which is correct.\n\nAlso, from ribrpus, we have lazvpus, which is yoywpus, etc.\n\nAnd eventually to femgpus is cilcpus.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTo avoid missing, let's see if there is a shorter path.\n\nNotice that from yeqypus is jozmpus and vihnpus, but we used jozmpus to nekppus, etc.\n\nBut also, yeqypus is from zayspus, which is from xurkpus, etc.\n\nAnother thing: we have cilcpus is deztpus, and deztpus is hutkpus? From \"deztpus is hutkpus.\" but that might not be necessary since we need babkpus.\n\nAlso, from cilcpus is fowjpus and tayhpus, but again, not relevant.\n\nSo, the key is that we have a path from x to cilcpus to babkpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babkpus.\n\nSo, for the question, it is true that x is babkpus, so the \"or\" statement is true.\n\nThus, the answer should be true.\n\nBut the question is: \"Is it true or false or unknown: x is babgpus or babkpus or babmpus?\"\n\nSince x is babkpus, it is true.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's see if babgpus or babmpus are mentioned anywhere. From the given information, I don't see any reference to babgpus or babmpus. So, we don't know if x is them, but since x is babkpus, the \"or\" is satisfied.\n\nSo, final answer.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

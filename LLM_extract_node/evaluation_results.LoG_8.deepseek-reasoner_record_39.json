  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is one of babbpus, babcpus, or babppus. From the given information, x is lemjpus. So, I have to trace what lemjpus is and see if it leads to any of these categories.\n\nLet me list out the relevant statements:\n\n- x is lemjpus.\n\n- lemjpus is jeyypus and xeympus.\n\nSo, lemjpus contains jeyypus and xeympus. But since we're dealing with categories, I need to find what jeyypus and xeympus are, and see if they eventually lead to babbpus or others.\n\nNow, jeyypus is mentioned in a few places:\n\n- jeyypus is jinrpus.\n\n- jeyypus is mudmpus.\n\nFrom the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so jeyypus belongs to jinrpus and also to mudmpus. But I need to see the hierarchy.\n\nAlso, from lemjpus, it is jeyypus and xeympus, meaning lemjpus includes jeyypus and xeympus.\n\nBut I need to find if x is babbpus, which means I need to see if lemjpus is connected to babbpus.\n\nbabbpus is mentioned in the context of miympus: miympus is babbpus and kichpus.\n\nAnd miympus is related to nupmpus: nupmpus is miympus.\n\nAnd nupmpus is related to hirxpus: hirxpus is nupmpus.\n\nAnd hirxpus is related to codjpus: codjpus is hirxpus.\n\nAnd codjpus is related to gofzpus: gofzpus is codjpus and rahbpus.\n\nBut gofzpus is also related to wuyzpus: wuyzpus is gofzpus.\n\nAnd wuyzpus is related to soghpus: soghpus is wuyzpus.\n\nAnd soghpus is related to qobspus: qobspus is soghpus and wevvpus.\n\nBut this seems messy.

So, through this long chain, we can see that jeyypus eventually leads to babbpus? But let's see if jeyypus is connected to this chain.\n\nFrom jeyypus, I went to jinrpus, which leads to gubypus, and so on, but this chain ended up at miympus which is babbpus. But is jeyypus directly connected? In this chain, I started from jeyypus to jinrpus to gubypus, etc., and after many steps, to miympus to babbpus.\n\nBut I also have jeyypus is mudmpus. What is mudmpus? mudmpus is mentioned: jeyypus is mudmpus. And mudmpus is cercpus? From the list: mudmpus is cercpus? Wait, no, I see: mudmpus is not directly defined. From the given information: \"jeyypus is mudmpus.\" but what is mudmpus? I don't see a statement like \"mudmpus is something\". Let me check the given information again.\n\nLooking back at the given information: \"jeyypus is mudmpus.\" but there is no other definition for mudmpus. Similarly, \"mudmpus is cercpus.\" is not stated. I think I missed something.\n\nLet me read the given information carefully:\n\n\"jeyypus is jinrpus.\" \n\n\"jeyypus is mudmpus.\"  // so jeyypus belongs to mudmpus, but what mudmpus is, is not defined elsewhere? Wait, no, later I see: \"mudmpus is cercpus.\"? Let's see the entire text.\n\nFrom the given information: \"jeyypus is mudmpus.\" and then \"duwmpus is milkpus.\" but no \"mudmpus is something\". Perhaps I need to look for mudmpus.\n\nIn the list, I see: \"lemjpus is jeyypus and xeympus.\" and \"jeyypus is jinrpus.\" and \"jeyypus is mudmpus.\" but no definition for mudmpus. So mudmpus might be a terminal category or something, but I need to see if it connects to babbpus.\n\nPerhaps from other paths.\n\nAnother thing: x is lemjpus, which is jeyypus and xeympus. So if jeyypus leads to babbpus, then x might be babbpus, but I need to confirm.\n\nFrom the chain I started from jeyypus via jinrpus, I ended up at babbpus, but that chain was very long and I might have missed that jeyypus is directly connected to jinrpus, and jinrpus to gubypus, etc.\n\nBut let's see if there is a shorter path or if this chain is valid.\n\nI recall that in the chain, I have gofzpus which is codjpus, and codjpus is hirxpus, hirxpus is nupmpus, nupmpus is miympus, miympus is babbpus.\n\nBut how is jeyypus connected to gofzpus? From my earlier chain, through jinrpus, gubypus, cipwpus, kaptpus, jijzpus, rugtpus, rikdpus, kovwpus, peyzpus, ralqpus, jufnpus, coqppus, cafgpus, huvhpus, tabfpus, sezvpus, caxkpus, neqjpus, cilzpus, zawypus, kamppus, sewxpus, miljpus, soslpus, tojmpus, helkpus, lerbpus, heggpus, yepzpus, loddpus, lidppus, teyzpus, bewxpus, kucrpus, pezbpus, buklpus, rujypus, duwmpus, milkpus, zumspus, qobspus, soghpus, wuyzpus, gofzpus, codjpus, hirxpus, nupmpus, miympus, babbpus.\n\nThis is extremely long, and I might have made a mistake because this seems inefficient. Perhaps there is a better way.\n\nAnother point: from jeyypus is mudmpus, but since mudmpus is not defined, it might not help, or perhaps I need to see if mudmpus is connected elsewhere.\n\nLet's list all statements from the given information that might be relevant.\n\nI see that miympus is babbpus, and miympus is from nupmpus, and nupmpus from hirxpus, hirxpus from codjpus, codjpus from gofzpus.\n\ngofzpus is also from wuyzpus, and wuyzpus from soghpus, soghpus from qobspus, etc., but also from other paths.\n\nBut for x, we have x is lemjpus, and lemjpus is jeyypus and xeympus.\n\nNow, jeyypus is jinrpus, and jinrpus is gubypus.\n\ngubypus is cipwpus and horwpus.\n\ncipwpus is kaptpus.\n\nkaptpus is jijzpus.\n\njijzpus is rugtpus.\n\nrugtpus is rikdpus and dudlpus.\n\nrikdpus is kovwpus and jaxzpus.\n\nkovwpus is peyzpus.\n\npeyzpus is ralqpus.\n\nralqpus is jufnpus and jowlpus.\n\njufnpus is coqppus and guyspus.\n\ncoqppus is cafgpus.\n\ncafgpus is huvhpus.\n\nhuvhpus is tabfpus and racmpus.\n\ntabfpus is sezvpus and kokzpus.\n\nsezvpus is caxkpus.\n\ncaxkpus is neqjpus.\n\nneqjpus is cilzpus.\n\ncilzpus is zawypus.\n\nzawypus is kamppus.\n\nkamppus is sewxpus.\n\nsewxpus is miljpus.\n\nmiljpus is soslpus and ligppus and qiwlpus.\n\nsoslpus is tojmpus.\n\ntojmpus is helkpus.\n\nhelkpus is lerbpus.\n\nlerbpus is heggpus.\n\nheggpus is yepzpus and semhpus.\n\nyepzpus is loddpus.\n\nloddpus is lidppus.\n\nlidppus is teyzpus.\n\nteyzpus is bewxpus.\n\nbewxpus is kucrpus and zisppus and rijwpus and yuclpus.\n\nkucrpus is pezbpus.\n\npezbpus is buklpus and joshpus.\n\nbuklpus is rujypus.\n\nrujypus is duwmpus and fugbpus.\n\nduwpus is milkpus? duwmpus is milkpus.\n\nduwmpus is milkpus.\n\nmilkpus is zumspus.\n\nzumspus is qobspus.\n\nqobspus is soghpus and wevvpus.\n\nsoghpus is wuyzpus.\n\nwuyzpus is gofzpus.\n\ngofzpus is codjpus and rahbpus.\n\ncodjpus is hirxpus.\n\nhirxpus is nupmpus.\n\nnupmpus is miympus.\n\nmiympus is babbpus and kichpus.\n\nSo, yes, from jeyypus, through this long chain, we reach babbpus. Therefore, jeyypus belongs to babbpus? But let's see the direction.\n\nIn the \"is\" relation, if A is B, means A belongs to B, so if we have a chain A is B, B is C, then A is C, meaning A belongs to C.\n\nBut in this case, from jeyypus is jinrpus, and jinrpus is gubypus, so jeyypus is gubypus, and so on. Eventually, through the chain, jeyypus is miympus, and since miympus is babbpus, meaning miympus belongs to babbpus, so if jeyypus is miympus, then jeyypus belongs to babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, since lemjpus is jeyypus, so lemjpus is jeyypus, meaning lemjpus belongs to jeyypus, so since jeyypus belongs to babbpus, then lemjpus also belongs to babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is lemjpus, so x belongs to babbpus.\n\nSo, for the question, x is babbpus, so it is true that x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus? Since x is babbpus, it is true for babbpus.\n\nThe question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" and since x is babbpus, it is true.\n\nBut I need to confirm if babcpus or babppus are mentioned? From the information, babcpus and babppus are not mentioned anywhere. So, we don't know if x is babcpus or babppus, but since x is babbpus, the OR condition is true because one of them is true.\n\nSo, the statement is true.\n\nBut let me make sure that there is no other issue.\n\nAlso, from lemjpus, it is also xeympus, but since we already have that jeyypus leads to babbpus, and lemjpus contains jeyypus, so it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps there is a shorter path. Notice that from gofzpus to codjpus to hirxpus to nupmpus to miympus to babbpus, and gofzpus is also from wuyzpus, but from jeyypus, how did we connect to gofzpus? In the long chain, we went through many nodes to eventually reach gofzpus.\n\nBut is there a direct connection from jeyypus to gofzpus? From the given information, I don't see a direct link. But through the chain, it is connected.\n\nAnother thing: in the chain, I have rujypus which is duwmpus and fugbpus, and duwmpus is milkpus, milkpus is zumspus, zumspus is qobspus, qobspus is soghpus, soghpus is wuyzpus, wuyzpus is gofzpus, so it seems correct.\n\nBut let me see if jeyypus is connected to rujypus. From jeyypus, we went through jinrpus, gubypus, cipwpus, kaptpus, jijzpus, rugtpus, rikdpus, kovwpus, peyzpus, ralqpus, jufnpus, coqppus, cafgpus, huvhpus, tabfpus, sezvpus, caxkpus, neqjpus, cilzpus, zawypus, kamppus, sewxpus, miljpus, soslpus, tojmpus, helkpus, lerbpus, heggpus, yepzpus, loddpus, lidppus, teyzpus, bewxpus, kucrpus, pezbpus, buklpus, rujypus. So yes, we reached rujypus, which is connected to duwmpus, etc.\n\nSo, the chain is valid.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus.\n\nSo, for the question, it is true that x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus.\n\nSince babcpus and babppus are not mentioned, but since x is babbpus, the OR is true.\n\nThus, the answer should be true.\n\nBut the question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" and we know x is babbpus, so yes.\n\nSo, I think that's it.",

So, we don't know if x is babcpus or babppus, but since x is babbpus, the OR condition is true because one of them is true.\n\nSo, the statement is true.\n\nBut let me make sure that there is no other issue.\n\nAlso, from lemjpus, it is also xeympus, but since we already have that jeyypus leads to babbpus, and lemjpus contains jeyypus, so it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps there is a shorter path. Notice that from gofzpus to codjpus to hirxpus to nupmpus to miympus to babbpus, and gofzpus is also from wuyzpus, but from jeyypus, how did we connect to gofzpus? In the long chain, we went through many nodes to eventually reach gofzpus.\n\nBut is there a direct connection from jeyypus to gofzpus? From the given information, I don't see a direct link. But through the chain, it is connected.\n\nAnother thing: in the chain, I have rujypus which is duwmpus and fugbpus, and duwmpus is milkpus, milkpus is zumspus, zumspus is qobspus, qobspus is soghpus, soghpus is wuyzpus, wuyzpus is gofzpus, so it seems correct.\n\nBut let me see if jeyypus is connected to rujypus. From jeyypus, we went through jinrpus, gubypus, cipwpus, kaptpus, jijzpus, rugtpus, rikdpus, kovwpus, peyzpus, ralqpus, jufnpus, coqppus, cafgpus, huvhpus, tabfpus, sezvpus, caxkpus, neqjpus, cilzpus, zawypus, kamppus, sewxpus, miljpus, soslpus, tojmpus, helkpus, lerbpus, heggpus, yepzpus, loddpus, lidppus, teyzpus, bewxpus, kucrpus, pezbpus, buklpus, rujypus. So yes, we reached rujypus, which is connected to duwmpus, etc.\n\nSo, the chain is valid.\n\nTherefore, x is babbpus.\n\nSo, for the question, it is true that x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus.\n\nSince babcpus and babppus are not mentioned, but since x is babbpus, the OR is true.\n\nThus, the answer should be true.\n\nBut the question is \"x is babbpus or babcpus or babppus?\" and we know x is babbpus, so yes.\n\nSo, I think that's it.",

Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15.

      "prompt": "You are a specialized assistant for extracting logical statements. Please extract all statements in the form \"A is B\" from the given sentence.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n1. Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13. IMPORTANT: Statements from questions (sentences ending with \"?\") should ALWAYS be classified as PLANNING type, not ACTUAL\n14. IMPORTANT: Statements from hypothetical or conditional expressions (\"if\", \"whether\", \"suppose\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n15. IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo, I think that's it.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",

  "reasoning_text": "First, I need to determine if x is both babbpus and babmpus. The given information says \"x is kevdpus\", so x belongs to kevdpus. I need to find out if kevdpus is connected to babbpus and babmpus.\n\nLet me list out all the relationships from the given information. I'll organize them so I can trace the categories.\n\nStart with x: x is kevdpus.\n\nNow, kevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus. So kevdpus belongs to filkpus and mibtpus.\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus and babmpus. babbpus is mentioned in \"viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus\". And babmpus is mentioned in \"yefppus is babmpus and qoclpus\".\n\nAlso, yefppus is related to qizjpus: \"qizjpus is yefppus\" and \"qizjpus is yexhpus\", but that might be a typo or multiple categories? Let's see: \"qizjpus is yexhpus\" and then \"qizjpus is yefppus\", so qizjpus belongs to both yexhpus and yefppus? But in the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so it can belong to multiple categories.\n\nSimilarly, \"tasmpus is qizjpus\" so tasmpus belongs to qizjpus.\n\nNow, babbpus is under viycpus: viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus.\n\nAnd viycpus is also under duxvpus: \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus\" and \"didzpus is bugypus and pogwpus\" and \"miyfpus is didzpus\" and \"polrpus is miyfpus and qokzpus\" and \"sagrpus is polrpus\" and \"voldpus is sagrpus\" but that might not lead to babbpus directly.\n\nduxvpus is directly related to viycpus: \"duxvpus is viycpus\" from \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus\" but wait, no: \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus\" means bugypus belongs to duxvpus and tejrpus. Then \"didzpus is bugypus and pogwpus\" so didzpus belongs to bugypus, so indirectly, didzpus belongs to duxvpus.\n\nBut duxvpus is viycpus? Let's see: from \"duxvpus is viycpus\" – is that stated? I think I misread. Looking back: \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus\" – this means bugypus belongs to duxvpus and tejrpus. But there is no direct \"duxvpus is viycpus\". Instead, we have \"viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus\" and also \"duxvpus is viycpus\" is not said.\n\nWait, there is: \"duxvpus is viycpus\" – let's check the given information. I see: \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus. vaxnpus is fesrpus and rolrpus. voldpus is sagrpus. hovcpus is hejypus and gonzpus. vuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus. vewwpus is duflpus. viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus.\"\n\nSo, no direct link from duxvpus to viycpus. But from bugypus, we have duxvpus, and from didzpus, we have bugypus, but that doesn't connect to viycpus.\n\nPerhaps I need to find where viycpus comes from. viycpus is listed as having babbpus, but who is viycpus belonging to? It doesn't seem to be connected to any other category in the given information, except that it is a category itself.\n\nSimilarly for babmpus, it is under yefppus, and yefppus is under qizjpus, but qizjpus is also under other things.\n\nI need to find a path from x to babbpus and to babmpus.\n\nSince x is kevdpus, and kevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus.\n\nfilkpus is mehypus: \"filkpus is mehypus\"\n\nmehypus is sozzpus and secrpus and sexrpus: \"mehypus is sozzpus and secrpus and sexrpus\"\n\nsozzpus is wosdpus: \"sozzpus is wosdpus\"\n\nwosdpus is vuvzpus and sugppus: \"wosdpus is vuvzpus and sugppus\"\n\nvuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus, and also vuvzpus is ralhpus and fozhpus: \"vuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus\" and \"vuvzpus is ralhpus and fozhpus\" so vuvzpus has multiple categories.\n\nBut I need babbpus, which is under viycpus. How is viycpus related? viycpus is not directly connected to any of these yet.\n\nPerhaps from duxvpus? But duxvpus is part of bugypus, and bugypus is part of didzpus, and didzpus is part of miyfpus, and miyfpus is part of polrpus, and polrpus is part of sagrpus, and sagrpus is part of voldpus, and voldpus is part of cisfpus? \"cisfpus is voldpus\" – wait, \"cisfpus is voldpus\" means cisfpus belongs to voldpus? No, according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if \"cisfpus is voldpus\", that means cisfpus is contained in voldpus, so voldpus is a category that contains cisfpus.\n\nBut from earlier, \"voldpus is sagrpus\" means voldpus belongs to sagrpus, so sagrpus contains voldpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"sagrpus is polrpus\" means sagrpus belongs to polrpus, so polrpus contains sagrpus.\n\n\"polrpus is miyfpus and qokzpus\" so polrpus contains miyfpus and qokzpus.\n\n\"miyfpus is didzpus\" so miyfpus contains didzpus.\n\n\"didzpus is bugypus and pogwpus\" so didzpus contains bugypus.\n\n\"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus\" so bugypus contains duxvpus.\n\nBut where is viycpus? duxvpus is not directly linked to viycpus. However, notice that \"duxvpus is viycpus\" is not stated, but we have \"viycpus is babbpus...\" which means viycpus contains babbpus, but for x to be babbpus, we need x to be contained in viycpus or in a chain that leads to viycpus.\n\nBut from above, duxvpus is contained in bugypus, but viycpus is not containing duxvpus; instead, we need duxvpus to contain viycpus or something.\n\nPerhaps I have it backward. The statement \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so B is a broader category that includes A.\n\nSo for viycpus, it is said that viycpus is babbpus, meaning viycpus belongs to babbpus? No, let's read carefully: \"viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus\"\n\nAccording to the note, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', so if \"viycpus is babbpus\", that means viycpus is contained in babbpus? Or does it mean viycpus contains babbpus?\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, for example, \"maxhpus is caltpus\" means maxhpus belongs to caltpus, so caltpus contains maxhpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"viycpus is babbpus\" means viycpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus contains viycpus.\n\nBut that would mean that babbpus is a category that contains viycpus, but we want x to be babbpus, meaning x belongs to babbpus, so x must be contained in babbpus. But if babbpus contains viycpus, then for x to be babbpus, x must be viycpus or contained in viycpus, but viycpus contains babbpus? No, let's clarify.\n\nThe statement \"viycpus is babbpus\" means viycpus is contained in babbpus, so babbpus is a super-category of viycpus.\n\nTherefore, if something is viycpus, it is also babbpus because it is contained in babbpus. But the question is \"x is babbpus\", which means x belongs to babbpus, so x must be contained in babbpus. So if x is viycpus, then since viycpus is contained in babbpus, x is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, for babmpus, \"yefppus is babmpus\" means yefppus is contained in babmpus, so if x is yefppus, then x is babmpus.\n\nBut we need x to be both babbpus and babmpus.\n\nSo, from x, we need to see if x is contained in viycpus or in yefppus, or directly in babbpus or babmpus.\n\nBut from the given, we have x is kevdpus.\n\nkevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus.\n\nfilkpus is mehypus.\n\nmehypus is sozzpus and secrpus and sexrpus.\n\nsozzpus is wosdpus.\n\nwosdpus is vuvzpus and sugppus.\n\nvuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus, and also vuvzpus is ralhpus and fozhpus.\n\nBut this doesn't seem to lead to viycpus.\n\nNow, let's look for viycpus. viycpus is mentioned as containing babbpus, but who contains viycpus? Is viycpus contained in any other category?\n\nFrom the given, we have \"duxvpus is viycpus\" – is that stated? Let's read the given information again carefully.\n\nThe given information: \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus. vaxnpus is fesrpus and rolrpus. voldpus is sagrpus. hovcpus is hejypus and gonzpus. vuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus. vewwpus is duflpus. viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus.\"\n\nThere is no \"duxvpus is viycpus\" here. So duxvpus is not directly related to viycpus.\n\nBut later, we have \"duxvpus is viycpus\" – wait, no, in the list, after \"vewwpus is duflpus\" it says \"viycpus is babbpus...\" so no link from duxvpus to viycpus.\n\nHowever, we have \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus\" which means bugypus belongs to duxvpus and tejrpus, so duxvpus contains bugypus.\n\nBut for viycpus, we need to find if duxvpus contains viycpus or something.\n\nPerhaps from another angle. Let's see where viycpus is used. Notice that in \"viycpus is babbpus...\" it is defining what viycpus contains, but for belonging, we need to know what contains viycpus.\n\nIs there any statement that says something is viycpus? For example, if we have \"A is viycpus\", then A belongs to viycpus, and since viycpus is babbpus, A belongs to babbpus.\n\nBut from the given, is there any A that is viycpus? Let's look.\n\nWe have \"duxvpus is viycpus\" not stated, but we have \"duxvpus is viycpus\" from another part? Let's read the entire given information.\n\nI think I missed something. Let's list all statements from the given.\n\nFrom the beginning: \n- maxhpus is caltpus.\n- kidbpus is gatjpus.\n- zafypus is poyhpus and zowvpus.\n- x is kevdpus.\n- bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus.\n- vaxnpus is fesrpus and rolrpus.\n- voldpus is sagrpus.\n- hovcpus is hejypus and gonzpus.\n- vuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus.\n- vewwpus is duflpus.\n- viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus.   // so viycpus contains babbpus, etc.\n- qizjpus is yexhpus.\n- sephpus is pattpus and casvpus and qinspus.\n- weccpus is maxhpus and ceyfpus.\n- wosdpus is vuvzpus and sugppus.\n- mokspus is hogkpus and leynpus.\n- qizjpus is yefppus.   // so qizjpus belongs to yefppus? Or contains? According to note, \"qizjpus is yefppus\" means qizjpus belongs to yefppus, so yefppus contains qizjpus.\n- xehhpus is sephpus.\n- raqqpus is sobmpus and capjpus.\n- cisfpus is pixdpus.   // cisfpus belongs to pixdpus? But later \"cisfpus is voldpus\" so contradiction? Let's see.\n\nContinue:\n- sagrpus is polrpus.\n- duflpus is zoxtpus and pantpus.\n- ralhpus is qatkpus.\n- nipkpus is qoxfpus and gidhpus and pixnpus and yesmpus.\n- qelvpus is vewwpus and gewwpus.\n- pattpus is heslpus.\n- miyfpus is didzpus.\n- yefppus is babmpus and qoclpus.   // so yefppus belongs to babmpus, so babmpus contains yefppus.\n- filkpus is mehypus.\n- mehypus is sozzpus and secrpus and sexrpus.\n- yexhpus is pohnpus and kewcpus and yumtpus.\n- pincpus is vaxnpus.\n- qoxfpus is weccpus.\n- newppus is kixspus.\n- polrpus is miyfpus and qokzpus.\n- xanppus is puhgpus.\n- sozzpus is wosdpus.\n- pixdpus is qitnpus.\n- zafypus is kidbpus and poffpus.   // zafypus belongs to kidbpus and poffpus.\n- wisfpus is cisfpus and purtpus.\n- qatkpus is rewgpus and wolnpus.\n- vuvzpus is ralhpus and fozhpus.   // vuvzpus belongs to ralhpus and fozhpus.\n- hejypus is qelvpus.\n- tasmpus is qizjpus.   // tasmpus belongs to qizjpus.\n- puvwpus is xihjpus and womnpus.\n- yedppus is zesnpus and tumjpus.\n- poyhpus is xanppus.\n- pambpus is raqqpus.\n- caltpus is pincpus and yidxpus.\n- peflpus is tutppus.\n- kixspus is xehhpus and xilbpus.\n- vewwpus is peflpus.   // but earlier vewwpus is duflpus, so vewwpus belongs to duflpus and also to peflpus? So multiple belonging.\n- jurdpus is newppus and tomypus and takhpus.\n- sobmpus is hovcpus and vujfpus.\n- zesnpus is nipkpus and harwpus.\n- gatjpus is ziscpus.\n- gomspus is qivhpus.\n- rewgpus is pambpus.\n- kevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus.   // so kevdpus belongs to filkpus and mibtpus.\n- zoxtpus is hozppus.\n- tasmpus is vetwpus.   // tasmpus belongs to vetwpus? But earlier tasmpus is qizjpus, so multiple.\n- didzpus is bugypus and pogwpus.\n- puhgpus is yedppus.\n- duxvpus is viycpus.   // ah! Here it is! I missed it earlier. In the list, after \"puhgpus is yedppus\" it says \"duxvpus is viycpus\" so yes, \"duxvpus is viycpus\" means duxvpus belongs to viycpus.\n\nSo, duxvpus is contained in viycpus.\n\nBut from earlier, bugypus is contained in duxvpus, so bugypus is contained in duxvpus, which is contained in viycpus, so bugypus is contained in viycpus.\n\nSimilarly, didzpus is contained in bugypus, so didzpus is contained in viycpus, and so on.\n\nBut for x, we need x to be contained in viycpus to be babbpus, since viycpus is contained in babbpus? No.\n\nLet's clarify the chain.\n\nFrom \"viycpus is babbpus\" means viycpus is contained in babbpus, so babbpus contains viycpus.\n\nFrom \"duxvpus is viycpus\" means duxvpus is contained in viycpus.\n\nTherefore, since duxvpus is contained in viycpus, and viycpus is contained in babbpus, so duxvpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, anything contained in duxvpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nNow, x is kevdpus, and we need to see if kevdpus is contained in duxvpus or directly in viycpus.\n\nkevdpus is contained in filkpus and mibtpus.\n\nfilkpus is contained in mehypus.\n\nmehypus is contained in sozzpus, etc., but that doesn't lead to duxvpus.\n\nFrom kevdpus, is there a path to duxvpus?\n\nNotice that kevdpus is also contained in mibtpus, but mibtpus is not further defined, so we don't know what mibtpus contains or what contains it.\n\nBut from the chain involving duxvpus, we have bugypus is contained in duxvpus, and didzpus is contained in bugypus, and miyfpus is contained in didzpus, and polrpus contains miyfpus, but polrpus is contained in sagrpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom \"polrpus is miyfpus and qokzpus\" means polrpus is contained in miyfpus? No, according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so A is contained in B.\n\nSo \"polrpus is miyfpus\" means polrpus is contained in miyfpus? That would mean miyfpus contains polrpus.\n\nBut from \"miyfpus is didzpus\" means miyfpus is contained in didzpus, so didzpus contains miyfpus.\n\nIf polrpus is contained in miyfpus, and miyfpus is contained in didzpus, then polrpus is contained in didzpus.\n\nBut from \"sagrpus is polrpus\" means sagrpus is contained in polrpus, so polrpus contains sagrpus.\n\nSo from sagrpus contained in polrpus contained in miyfpus contained in didzpus contained in bugypus contained in duxvpus contained in viycpus contained in babbpus.\n\nSo sagrpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nBut we have x is kevdpus, and kevdpus is not directly related to sagrpus.\n\nkevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus.\n\nfilkpus is mehypus, and mehypus is sozzpus, etc., which leads to vuvzpus, but vuvzpus is not related to duxvpus directly.\n\nPerhaps from other side.\n\nWe also have \"voldpus is sagrpus\" means voldpus is contained in sagrpus, so sagrpus contains voldpus.\n\nAnd \"cisfpus is voldpus\" means cisfpus is contained in voldpus, so voldpus contains cisfpus.\n\nBut \"cisfpus is pixdpus\" means cisfpus is contained in pixdpus, so pixdpus contains cisfpus.\n\nBut this doesn't help with kevdpus.\n\nNow, back to x: x is kevdpus.\n\nkevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus.\n\nfilkpus is mehypus.\n\nmehypus is sozzpus and secrpus and sexrpus.\n\nsozzpus is wosdpus.\n\nwosdpus is vuvzpus and sugppus.\n\nvuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus, and also vuvzpus is ralhpus and fozhpus.\n\nralhpus is qatkpus.\n\nqatkpus is rewgpus and wolnpus.\n\nrewgpus is pambpus.\n\npambpus is raqqpus.\n\nraqqpus is sobmpus and capjpus.\n\nsobmpus is hovcpus and vujfpus.\n\nhovcpus is hejypus and gonzpus.\n\nhejypus is qelvpus.\n\nqelvpus is vewwpus and gewwpus.\n\nvewwpus is duflpus and also vewwpus is peflpus.\n\nduflpus is zoxtpus and pantpus.\n\nzoxtpus is hozppus.\n\nho zppus is zafypus and cowwpus and fusfpus.\n\nzafypus is poyhpus and zowvpus, and also zafypus is kidbpus and poffpus.\n\nkidbpus is gatjpus.\n\ngatjpus is ziscpus.\n\nziscpus is jurdpus.\n\njurdpus is newppus and tomypus and takhpus.\n\nnewppus is kixspus.\n\nkixspus is xehhpus and xilbpus.\n\nxehhpus is sephpus.\n\nsephpus is pattpus and casvpus and qinspus.\n\npattpus is heslpus.\n\nheslpus is tasmpus.\n\ntasmpus is qizjpus and also tasmpus is vetwpus.\n\nqizjpus is yexhpus and also qizjpus is yefppus.\n\nyefppus is babmpus and qoclpus.\n\nSo from this long chain, we see that through filkpus, we eventually get to yefppus, which is contained in babmpus, so if x is contained in yefppus, then x is babmpus.\n\nBut from above, x is kevdpus, which is filkpus, and filkpus is mehypus, and so on, but does this chain include yefppus? From tasmpus is qizjpus, and qizjpus is yefppus, so yes, eventually, through many steps, kevdpus is contained in yefppus? Let's see the direction.\n\nkevdpus is contained in filkpus.\n\nfilkpus is contained in mehypus.\n\nmehypus is contained in sozzpus.\n\nsozzpus is contained in wosdpus.\n\nwosdpus is contained in vuvzpus? No: \"wosdpus is vuvzpus and sugppus\" means wosdpus is contained in vuvzpus and sugppus, so vuvzpus contains wosdpus.\n\nSimilarly, vuvzpus is contained in ralhpus and fozhpus? \"vuvzpus is ralhpus and fozhpus\" means vuvzpus is contained in ralhpus and fozhpus, so ralhpus contains vuvzpus.\n\nralhpus is contained in qatkpus? \"ralhpus is qatkpus\" means ralhpus is contained in qatkpus, so qatkpus contains ralhpus.\n\nqatkpus is contained in rewgpus and wolnpus? \"qatkpus is rewgpus and wolnpus\" means qatkpus is contained in rewgpus and wolnpus, so rewgpus contains qatkpus.\n\nrewgpus is contained in pambpus? \"rewgpus is pambpus\" means rewgpus is contained in pambpus, so pambpus contains rewgpus.\n\npambpus is contained in raqqpus? \"pambpus is raqqpus\" means pambpus is contained in raqqpus, so raqqpus contains pambpus.\n\nraqqpus is contained in sobmpus and capjpus? \"raqqpus is sobmpus and capjpus\" means raqqpus is contained in sobmpus and capjpus, so sobmpus contains raqqpus.\n\nsobmpus is contained in hovcpus and vujfpus? \"sobmpus is hovcpus and vujfpus\" means sobmpus is contained in hovcpus and vujfpus, so hovcpus contains sobmpus.\n\nhovcpus is contained in hejypus and gonzpus? \"hovcpus is hejypus and gonzpus\" means hovcpus is contained in hejypus and gonzpus, so hejypus contains hovcpus.\n\nhejypus is contained in qelvpus? \"hejypus is qelvpus\" means hejypus is contained in qelvpus, so qelvpus contains hejypus.\n\nqelvpus is contained in vewwpus and gewwpus? \"qelvpus is vewwpus and gewwpus\" means qelvpus is contained in vewwpus and gewwpus, so vewwpus contains qelvpus.\n\nvewwpus is contained in duflpus and peflpus? \"vewwpus is duflpus\" and \"vewwpus is peflpus\" so vewwpus is contained in duflpus and in peflpus.\n\nduflpus is contained in zoxtpus and pantpus? \"duflpus is zoxtpus and pantpus\" means duflpus is contained in zoxtpus and pantpus, so zoxtpus contains duflpus.\n\nzoxtpus is contained in hozppus? \"zoxtpus is hozppus\" means zoxtpus is contained in hozppus, so hozppus contains zoxtpus.\n\nho zppus is contained in zafypus and cowwpus and fusfpus? \"ho zppus is zafypus and cowwpus and fusfpus\" means hozppus is contained in zafypus and cowwpus and fusfpus, so zafypus contains hozppus.\n\nzafypus is contained in poyhpus and zowvpus, and also in kidbpus and poffpus? \"zafypus is poyhpus and zowvpus\" and \"zafypus is kidbpus and poffpus\" so zafypus is contained in poyhpus, zowvpus, kidbpus, poffpus.\n\npoyhpus is contained in xanppus? \"poyhpus is xanppus\" means poyhpus is contained in xanppus, so xanppus contains poyhpus.\n\nxanppus is contained in puhgpus? \"xanppus is puhgpus\" means xanppus is contained in puhgpus, so puhgpus contains xanppus.\n\npuhgpus is contained in yedppus? \"puhgpus is yedppus\" means puhgpus is contained in yedppus, so yedppus contains puhgpus.\n\nyedppus is contained in zesnpus and tumjpus? \"yedppus is zesnpus and tumjpus\" means yedppus is contained in zesnpus and tumjpus, so zesnpus contains yedppus.\n\nzesnpus is contained in nipkpus and harwpus? \"zesnpus is nipkpus and harwpus\" means zesnpus is contained in nipkpus and harwpus, so nipkpus contains zesnpus.\n\nnipkpus is contained in qoxfpus and gidhpus and pixnpus and yesmpus? \"nipkpus is qoxfpus and gidhpus and pixnpus and yesmpus\" means nipkpus is contained in qoxfpus, etc., so qoxfpus contains nipkpus.\n\nqoxfpus is contained in weccpus? \"qoxfpus is weccpus\" means qoxfpus is contained in weccpus, so weccpus contains qoxfpus.\n\nweccpus is contained in maxhpus and ceyfpus? \"weccpus is maxhpus and ceyfpus\" means weccpus is contained in maxhpus and ceyfpus, so maxhpus contains weccpus.\n\nmaxhpus is contained in caltpus? \"maxhpus is caltpus\" means maxhpus is contained in caltpus, so caltpus contains maxhpus.\n\ncaltpus is contained in pincpus and yidxpus? \"caltpus is pincpus and yidxpus\" means caltpus is contained in pincpus and yidxpus, so pincpus contains caltpus.\n\npincpus is contained in vaxnpus? \"pincpus is vaxnpus\" means pincpus is contained in vaxnpus, so vaxnpus contains pincpus.\n\nvaxnpus is contained in fesrpus and rolrpus? \"vaxnpus is fesrpus and rolrpus\" means vaxnpus is contained in fesrpus and rolrpus, so fesrpus contains vaxnpus.\n\nfesrpus is contained in wisfpus? But we have \"vaxnpus is fesrpus\" but also \"fesrpus is wisfpus\"? Not directly. From \"vaxnpus is fesrpus\" but fesrpus is not further defined except that it is contained in vaxnpus? No, \"vaxnpus is fesrpus\" means vaxnpus is contained in fesrpus, so fesrpus contains vaxnpus.\n\nBut we also have \"fesrpus is wisfpus\"? Let's see the given: \"vaxnpus is fesrpus and rolrpus\" so vaxnpus is contained in fesrpus and rolrpus.\n\nThen later, \"fesrpus is wisfpus\" is not stated. Instead, we have \"wisfpus is cisfpus and purtpus\" but that doesn't help.\n\nThis chain seems very long and doesn't lead to yefppus directly. From above, we have zesnpus contained in nipkpus, but nipkpus is contained in qoxfpus, etc., but we need to get to tasmpus or something.\n\nFrom heslpus is tasmpus, and tasmpus is qizjpus, and qizjpus is yefppus.\n\nBut in the chain from vewwpus, we have vewwpus contained in duflpus, then to zoxtpus, to hozppus, to zafypus, to kidbpus, to gatjpus, to ziscpus, to jurdpus, to newppus, to kixspus, to xehhpus, to sephpus, to pattpus, to heslpus, to tasmpus, to qizjpus, to yefppus.\n\nSo yes, from vewwpus, we can reach yefppus.\n\nBut vewwpus contains qelvpus? From earlier, qelvpus is contained in vewwpus, so vewwpus contains qelvpus, which contains hejypus, which contains hovcpus, which contains sobmpus, which contains raqqpus, which contains pambpus, which contains rewgpus, which contains qatkpus, which contains ralhpus, which contains vuvzpus, which contains wosdpus, which contains sozzpus, which contains mehypus, which contains filkpus, which contains kevdpus.\n\nSo, kevdpus is contained in filkpus, which is contained in mehypus, which is contained in sozzpus, which is contained in wosdpus, which is contained in vuvzpus, which is contained in ralhpus, which is contained in qatkpus, which is contained in rewgpus, which is contained in pambpus, which is contained in raqqpus, which is contained in sobmpus, which is contained in hovcpus, which is contained in hejypus, which is contained in qelvpus, which is contained in vewwpus.\n\nBut from vewwpus, we have vewwpus contained in duflpus, etc., but for containment, since vewwpus contains qelvpus, and we have kevdpus contained in vewwpus through the chain, so kevdpus is contained in vewwpus.\n\nThen from vewwpus, through duflpus, zoxtpus, hozppus, zafypus, kidbpus, gatjpus, ziscpus, jurdpus, newppus, kixspus, xehhpus, sephpus, pattpus, heslpus, tasmpus, qizjpus, to yefppus.\n\nSo, since vewwpus is contained in duflpus, and duflpus is contained in zoxtpus, and so on, eventually to yefppus, so vewwpus is contained in yefppus.\n\nTherefore, since kevdpus is contained in vewwpus, and vewwpus is contained in yefppus, so kevdpus is contained in yefppus.\n\nAnd since yefppus is contained in babmpus (from \"yefppus is babmpus\"), so kevdpus is contained in babmpus.\n\nTherefore, x is kevdpus, so x is contained in babmpus, so x is babmpus.\n\nNow, we need to see if x is babbpus.\n\nFrom earlier, we have duxvpus is contained in viycpus, and viycpus is contained in babbpus, so duxvpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nNow, is kevdpus contained in duxvpus?\n\nFrom the chain, we have bugypus contained in duxvpus, and didzpus contained in bugypus, and miyfpus contained in didzpus, and polrpus contained in miyfpus? No, from \"polrpus is miyfpus\" means polrpus is contained in miyfpus, so miyfpus contains polrpus.\n\nBut from \"miyfpus is didzpus\" means miyfpus is contained in didzpus, so didzpus contains miyfpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"didzpus is bugypus\" means didzpus is contained in bugypus, so bugypus contains didzpus.\n\n\"bugypus is duxvpus\" means bugypus is contained in duxvpus, so duxvpus contains bugypus.\n\nSo, from polrpus contained in miyfpus contained in didzpus contained in bugypus contained in duxvpus.\n\nSo polrpus is contained in duxvpus.\n\nBut we need kevdpus to be contained in duxvpus.\n\nIs kevdpus related to polrpus?\n\nFrom kevdpus, we have kevdpus contained in filkpus, which is contained in mehypus, etc., but that chain goes to vewwpus and then to yefppus, not to polrpus.\n\nFrom other side, we have voldpus contained in sagrpus, and sagrpus contained in polrpus, so voldpus contained in polrpus.\n\nBut voldpus is contained in cisfpus? \"cisfpus is voldpus\" means cisfpus is contained in voldpus, so voldpus contains cisfpus.\n\nBut cisfpus is contained in pixdpus? \"cisfpus is pixdpus\" means cisfpus is contained in pixdpus, so pixdpus contains cisfpus.\n\nNot related to kevdpus.\n\nPerhaps from mibtpus? kevdpus is contained in mibtpus, but mibtpus is not defined, so we don't know what mibtpus contains or what contains it.\n\nSo, there is no path from kevdpus to duxvpus that we can find.\n\nTherefore, kevdpus is not contained in duxvpus, and thus not contained in viycpus, and thus not contained in babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is not babbpus.\n\nBut we have shown that x is babmpus.\n\nSo for the question, \"x is babbpus and babmpus?\" we have x is babmpus but not babbpus, so it is false that x is both.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any other path.\n\nNotice that from \"kevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus\" so kevdpus is contained in both, but we used filkpus to get to babmpus, but for babbpus, we need another path.\n\nmibtpus is not used in any chain, so we don't know if mibtpus leads to babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, from duxvpus, we have duxvpus contained in viycpus, but we need kevdpus to be contained in duxvpus, which we don't have.\n\nThus, it is false that x is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babmpus but not babbpus, so the statement \"x is babbpus and babmpus\" is false.\n\nSo the answer should be false.",
  "thinking_text": "First, I need to determine if x is both babbpus and babmpus. The given information says \"x is kevdpus\", so x belongs to kevdpus. I need to find out if kevdpus is connected to babbpus and babmpus.\n\nLet me list out all the relationships from the given information. I'll organize them so I can trace the categories.\n\nStart with x: x is kevdpus.\n\nNow, kevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus. So kevdpus belongs to filkpus and mibtpus.\n\nBut I need to get to babbpus and babmpus. babbpus is mentioned in \"viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus\". And babmpus is mentioned in \"yefppus is babmpus and qoclpus\".\n\nAlso, yefppus is related to qizjpus: \"qizjpus is yefppus\" and \"qizjpus is yexhpus\", but that might be a typo or multiple categories? Let's see: \"qizjpus is yexhpus\" and then \"qizjpus is yefppus\", so qizjpus belongs to both yexhpus and yefppus? But in the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to category B, so it can belong to multiple categories.\n\nSimilarly, \"tasmpus is qizjpus\" so tasmpus belongs to qizjpus.\n\nNow, babbpus is under viycpus: viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus.\n\nAnd viycpus is also under duxvpus: \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus\" and \"didzpus is bugypus and pogwpus\" and \"miyfpus is didzpus\" and \"polrpus is miyfpus and qokzpus\" and \"sagrpus is polrpus\" and \"voldpus is sagrpus\" but that might not lead to babbpus directly.\n\nduxvpus is directly related to viycpus: \"duxvpus is viycpus\" from \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus\" but wait, no: \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus\" means bugypus belongs to duxvpus and tejrpus. Then \"didzpus is bugypus and pogwpus\" so didzpus belongs to bugypus, so indirectly, didzpus belongs to duxvpus.\n\nBut duxvpus is viycpus? Let's see: from \"duxvpus is viycpus\" – is that stated? I think I misread. Looking back: \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus\" – this means bugypus belongs to duxvpus and tejrpus. But there is no direct \"duxvpus is viycpus\". Instead, we have \"viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus\" and also \"duxvpus is viycpus\" is not said.\n\nWait, there is: \"duxvpus is viycpus\" – let's check the given information. I see: \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus. vaxnpus is fesrpus and rolrpus. voldpus is sagrpus. hovcpus is hejypus and gonzpus. vuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus. vewwpus is duflpus. viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus.\"\n\nSo, no direct link from duxvpus to viycpus. But from bugypus, we have duxvpus, and from didzpus, we have bugypus, but that doesn't connect to viycpus.\n\nPerhaps I need to find where viycpus comes from. viycpus is listed as having babbpus, but who is viycpus belonging to? It doesn't seem to be connected to any other category in the given information, except that it is a category itself.\n\nSimilarly for babmpus, it is under yefppus, and yefppus is under qizjpus, but qizjpus is also under other things.\n\nI need to find a path from x to babbpus and to babmpus.\n\nSince x is kevdpus, and kevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus.\n\nfilkpus is mehypus: \"filkpus is mehypus\"\n\nmehypus is sozzpus and secrpus and sexrpus: \"mehypus is sozzpus and secrpus and sexrpus\"\n\nsozzpus is wosdpus: \"sozzpus is wosdpus\"\n\nwosdpus is vuvzpus and sugppus: \"wosdpus is vuvzpus and sugppus\"\n\nvuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus, and also vuvzpus is ralhpus and fozhpus: \"vuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus\" and \"vuvzpus is ralhpus and fozhpus\" so vuvzpus has multiple categories.\n\nBut I need babbpus, which is under viycpus. How is viycpus related? viycpus is not directly connected to any of these yet.\n\nPerhaps from duxvpus? But duxvpus is part of bugypus, and bugypus is part of didzpus, and didzpus is part of miyfpus, and miyfpus is part of polrpus, and polrpus is part of sagrpus, and sagrpus is part of voldpus, and voldpus is part of cisfpus? \"cisfpus is voldpus\" – wait, \"cisfpus is voldpus\" means cisfpus belongs to voldpus? No, according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so if \"cisfpus is voldpus\", that means cisfpus is contained in voldpus, so voldpus is a category that contains cisfpus.\n\nBut from earlier, \"voldpus is sagrpus\" means voldpus belongs to sagrpus, so sagrpus contains voldpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"sagrpus is polrpus\" means sagrpus belongs to polrpus, so polrpus contains sagrpus.\n\n\"polrpus is miyfpus and qokzpus\" so polrpus contains miyfpus and qokzpus.\n\n\"miyfpus is didzpus\" so miyfpus contains didzpus.\n\n\"didzpus is bugypus and pogwpus\" so didzpus contains bugypus.\n\n\"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus\" so bugypus contains duxvpus.\n\nBut where is viycpus? duxvpus is not directly linked to viycpus. However, notice that \"duxvpus is viycpus\" is not stated, but we have \"viycpus is babbpus...\" which means viycpus contains babbpus, but for x to be babbpus, we need x to be contained in viycpus or in a chain that leads to viycpus.\n\nBut from above, duxvpus is contained in bugypus, but viycpus is not containing duxvpus; instead, we need duxvpus to contain viycpus or something.\n\nPerhaps I have it backward. The statement \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so B is a broader category that includes A.\n\nSo for viycpus, it is said that viycpus is babbpus, meaning viycpus belongs to babbpus? No, let's read carefully: \"viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus\"\n\nAccording to the note, 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B', so if \"viycpus is babbpus\", that means viycpus is contained in babbpus? Or does it mean viycpus contains babbpus?\n\nThe note says: 'A is B' means 'A belongs to category B' or 'A is contained in B'. So, for example, \"maxhpus is caltpus\" means maxhpus belongs to caltpus, so caltpus contains maxhpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"viycpus is babbpus\" means viycpus belongs to babbpus, so babbpus contains viycpus.\n\nBut that would mean that babbpus is a category that contains viycpus, but we want x to be babbpus, meaning x belongs to babbpus, so x must be contained in babbpus. But if babbpus contains viycpus, then for x to be babbpus, x must be viycpus or contained in viycpus, but viycpus contains babbpus? No, let's clarify.\n\nThe statement \"viycpus is babbpus\" means viycpus is contained in babbpus, so babbpus is a super-category of viycpus.\n\nTherefore, if something is viycpus, it is also babbpus because it is contained in babbpus. But the question is \"x is babbpus\", which means x belongs to babbpus, so x must be contained in babbpus. So if x is viycpus, then since viycpus is contained in babbpus, x is babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, for babmpus, \"yefppus is babmpus\" means yefppus is contained in babmpus, so if x is yefppus, then x is babmpus.\n\nBut we need x to be both babbpus and babmpus.\n\nSo, from x, we need to see if x is contained in viycpus or in yefppus, or directly in babbpus or babmpus.\n\nBut from the given, we have x is kevdpus.\n\nkevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus.\n\nfilkpus is mehypus.\n\nmehypus is sozzpus and secrpus and sexrpus.\n\nsozzpus is wosdpus.\n\nwosdpus is vuvzpus and sugppus.\n\nvuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus, and also vuvzpus is ralhpus and fozhpus.\n\nBut this doesn't seem to lead to viycpus.\n\nNow, let's look for viycpus. viycpus is mentioned as containing babbpus, but who contains viycpus? Is viycpus contained in any other category?\n\nFrom the given, we have \"duxvpus is viycpus\" – is that stated? Let's read the given information again carefully.\n\nThe given information: \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus. vaxnpus is fesrpus and rolrpus. voldpus is sagrpus. hovcpus is hejypus and gonzpus. vuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus. vewwpus is duflpus. viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus.\"\n\nThere is no \"duxvpus is viycpus\" here. So duxvpus is not directly related to viycpus.\n\nBut later, we have \"duxvpus is viycpus\" – wait, no, in the list, after \"vewwpus is duflpus\" it says \"viycpus is babbpus...\" so no link from duxvpus to viycpus.\n\nHowever, we have \"bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus\" which means bugypus belongs to duxvpus and tejrpus, so duxvpus contains bugypus.\n\nBut for viycpus, we need to find if duxvpus contains viycpus or something.\n\nPerhaps from another angle. Let's see where viycpus is used. Notice that in \"viycpus is babbpus...\" it is defining what viycpus contains, but for belonging, we need to know what contains viycpus.\n\nIs there any statement that says something is viycpus? For example, if we have \"A is viycpus\", then A belongs to viycpus, and since viycpus is babbpus, A belongs to babbpus.\n\nBut from the given, is there any A that is viycpus? Let's look.\n\nWe have \"duxvpus is viycpus\" not stated, but we have \"duxvpus is viycpus\" from another part? Let's read the entire given information.\n\nI think I missed something. Let's list all statements from the given.\n\nFrom the beginning: \n- maxhpus is caltpus.\n- kidbpus is gatjpus.\n- zafypus is poyhpus and zowvpus.\n- x is kevdpus.\n- bugypus is duxvpus and tejrpus.\n- vaxnpus is fesrpus and rolrpus.\n- voldpus is sagrpus.\n- hovcpus is hejypus and gonzpus.\n- vuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus.\n- vewwpus is duflpus.\n- viycpus is babbpus and nuzspus and wifwpus.   // so viycpus contains babbpus, etc.\n- qizjpus is yexhpus.\n- sephpus is pattpus and casvpus and qinspus.\n- weccpus is maxhpus and ceyfpus.\n- wosdpus is vuvzpus and sugppus.\n- mokspus is hogkpus and leynpus.\n- qizjpus is yefppus.   // so qizjpus belongs to yefppus? Or contains? According to note, \"qizjpus is yefppus\" means qizjpus belongs to yefppus, so yefppus contains qizjpus.\n- xehhpus is sephpus.\n- raqqpus is sobmpus and capjpus.\n- cisfpus is pixdpus.   // cisfpus belongs to pixdpus? But later \"cisfpus is voldpus\" so contradiction? Let's see.\n\nContinue:\n- sagrpus is polrpus.\n- duflpus is zoxtpus and pantpus.\n- ralhpus is qatkpus.\n- nipkpus is qoxfpus and gidhpus and pixnpus and yesmpus.\n- qelvpus is vewwpus and gewwpus.\n- pattpus is heslpus.\n- miyfpus is didzpus.\n- yefppus is babmpus and qoclpus.   // so yefppus belongs to babmpus, so babmpus contains yefppus.\n- filkpus is mehypus.\n- mehypus is sozzpus and secrpus and sexrpus.\n- yexhpus is pohnpus and kewcpus and yumtpus.\n- pincpus is vaxnpus.\n- qoxfpus is weccpus.\n- newppus is kixspus.\n- polrpus is miyfpus and qokzpus.\n- xanppus is puhgpus.\n- sozzpus is wosdpus.\n- pixdpus is qitnpus.\n- zafypus is kidbpus and poffpus.   // zafypus belongs to kidbpus and poffpus.\n- wisfpus is cisfpus and purtpus.\n- qatkpus is rewgpus and wolnpus.\n- vuvzpus is ralhpus and fozhpus.   // vuvzpus belongs to ralhpus and fozhpus.\n- hejypus is qelvpus.\n- tasmpus is qizjpus.   // tasmpus belongs to qizjpus.\n- puvwpus is xihjpus and womnpus.\n- yedppus is zesnpus and tumjpus.\n- poyhpus is xanppus.\n- pambpus is raqqpus.\n- caltpus is pincpus and yidxpus.\n- peflpus is tutppus.\n- kixspus is xehhpus and xilbpus.\n- vewwpus is peflpus.   // but earlier vewwpus is duflpus, so vewwpus belongs to duflpus and also to peflpus? So multiple belonging.\n- jurdpus is newppus and tomypus and takhpus.\n- sobmpus is hovcpus and vujfpus.\n- zesnpus is nipkpus and harwpus.\n- gatjpus is ziscpus.\n- gomspus is qivhpus.\n- rewgpus is pambpus.\n- kevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus.   // so kevdpus belongs to filkpus and mibtpus.\n- zoxtpus is hozppus.\n- tasmpus is vetwpus.   // tasmpus belongs to vetwpus? But earlier tasmpus is qizjpus, so multiple.\n- didzpus is bugypus and pogwpus.\n- puhgpus is yedppus.\n- duxvpus is viycpus.   // ah! Here it is! I missed it earlier. In the list, after \"puhgpus is yedppus\" it says \"duxvpus is viycpus\" so yes, \"duxvpus is viycpus\" means duxvpus belongs to viycpus.\n\nSo, duxvpus is contained in viycpus.\n\nBut from earlier, bugypus is contained in duxvpus, so bugypus is contained in duxvpus, which is contained in viycpus, so bugypus is contained in viycpus.\n\nSimilarly, didzpus is contained in bugypus, so didzpus is contained in viycpus, and so on.\n\nBut for x, we need x to be contained in viycpus to be babbpus, since viycpus is contained in babbpus? No.\n\nLet's clarify the chain.\n\nFrom \"viycpus is babbpus\" means viycpus is contained in babbpus, so babbpus contains viycpus.\n\nFrom \"duxvpus is viycpus\" means duxvpus is contained in viycpus.\n\nTherefore, since duxvpus is contained in viycpus, and viycpus is contained in babbpus, so duxvpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, anything contained in duxvpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nNow, x is kevdpus, and we need to see if kevdpus is contained in duxvpus or directly in viycpus.\n\nkevdpus is contained in filkpus and mibtpus.\n\nfilkpus is contained in mehypus.\n\nmehypus is contained in sozzpus, etc., but that doesn't lead to duxvpus.\n\nFrom kevdpus, is there a path to duxvpus?\n\nNotice that kevdpus is also contained in mibtpus, but mibtpus is not further defined, so we don't know what mibtpus contains or what contains it.\n\nBut from the chain involving duxvpus, we have bugypus is contained in duxvpus, and didzpus is contained in bugypus, and miyfpus is contained in didzpus, and polrpus contains miyfpus, but polrpus is contained in sagrpus? Let's see.\n\nFrom \"polrpus is miyfpus and qokzpus\" means polrpus is contained in miyfpus? No, according to the note, \"A is B\" means A belongs to B, so A is contained in B.\n\nSo \"polrpus is miyfpus\" means polrpus is contained in miyfpus? That would mean miyfpus contains polrpus.\n\nBut from \"miyfpus is didzpus\" means miyfpus is contained in didzpus, so didzpus contains miyfpus.\n\nIf polrpus is contained in miyfpus, and miyfpus is contained in didzpus, then polrpus is contained in didzpus.\n\nBut from \"sagrpus is polrpus\" means sagrpus is contained in polrpus, so polrpus contains sagrpus.\n\nSo from sagrpus contained in polrpus contained in miyfpus contained in didzpus contained in bugypus contained in duxvpus contained in viycpus contained in babbpus.\n\nSo sagrpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nBut we have x is kevdpus, and kevdpus is not directly related to sagrpus.\n\nkevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus.\n\nfilkpus is mehypus, and mehypus is sozzpus, etc., which leads to vuvzpus, but vuvzpus is not related to duxvpus directly.\n\nPerhaps from other side.\n\nWe also have \"voldpus is sagrpus\" means voldpus is contained in sagrpus, so sagrpus contains voldpus.\n\nAnd \"cisfpus is voldpus\" means cisfpus is contained in voldpus, so voldpus contains cisfpus.\n\nBut \"cisfpus is pixdpus\" means cisfpus is contained in pixdpus, so pixdpus contains cisfpus.\n\nBut this doesn't help with kevdpus.\n\nNow, back to x: x is kevdpus.\n\nkevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus.\n\nfilkpus is mehypus.\n\nmehypus is sozzpus and secrpus and sexrpus.\n\nsozzpus is wosdpus.\n\nwosdpus is vuvzpus and sugppus.\n\nvuvzpus is bethpus and xajqpus and zuxzpus, and also vuvzpus is ralhpus and fozhpus.\n\nralhpus is qatkpus.\n\nqatkpus is rewgpus and wolnpus.\n\nrewgpus is pambpus.\n\npambpus is raqqpus.\n\nraqqpus is sobmpus and capjpus.\n\nsobmpus is hovcpus and vujfpus.\n\nhovcpus is hejypus and gonzpus.\n\nhejypus is qelvpus.\n\nqelvpus is vewwpus and gewwpus.\n\nvewwpus is duflpus and also vewwpus is peflpus.\n\nduflpus is zoxtpus and pantpus.\n\nzoxtpus is hozppus.\n\nho zppus is zafypus and cowwpus and fusfpus.\n\nzafypus is poyhpus and zowvpus, and also zafypus is kidbpus and poffpus.\n\nkidbpus is gatjpus.\n\ngatjpus is ziscpus.\n\nziscpus is jurdpus.\n\njurdpus is newppus and tomypus and takhpus.\n\nnewppus is kixspus.\n\nkixspus is xehhpus and xilbpus.\n\nxehhpus is sephpus.\n\nsephpus is pattpus and casvpus and qinspus.\n\npattpus is heslpus.\n\nheslpus is tasmpus.\n\ntasmpus is qizjpus and also tasmpus is vetwpus.\n\nqizjpus is yexhpus and also qizjpus is yefppus.\n\nyefppus is babmpus and qoclpus.\n\nSo from this long chain, we see that through filkpus, we eventually get to yefppus, which is contained in babmpus, so if x is contained in yefppus, then x is babmpus.\n\nBut from above, x is kevdpus, which is filkpus, and filkpus is mehypus, and so on, but does this chain include yefppus? From tasmpus is qizjpus, and qizjpus is yefppus, so yes, eventually, through many steps, kevdpus is contained in yefppus? Let's see the direction.\n\nkevdpus is contained in filkpus.\n\nfilkpus is contained in mehypus.\n\nmehypus is contained in sozzpus.\n\nsozzpus is contained in wosdpus.\n\nwosdpus is contained in vuvzpus? No: \"wosdpus is vuvzpus and sugppus\" means wosdpus is contained in vuvzpus and sugppus, so vuvzpus contains wosdpus.\n\nSimilarly, vuvzpus is contained in ralhpus and fozhpus? \"vuvzpus is ralhpus and fozhpus\" means vuvzpus is contained in ralhpus and fozhpus, so ralhpus contains vuvzpus.\n\nralhpus is contained in qatkpus? \"ralhpus is qatkpus\" means ralhpus is contained in qatkpus, so qatkpus contains ralhpus.\n\nqatkpus is contained in rewgpus and wolnpus? \"qatkpus is rewgpus and wolnpus\" means qatkpus is contained in rewgpus and wolnpus, so rewgpus contains qatkpus.\n\nrewgpus is contained in pambpus? \"rewgpus is pambpus\" means rewgpus is contained in pambpus, so pambpus contains rewgpus.\n\npambpus is contained in raqqpus? \"pambpus is raqqpus\" means pambpus is contained in raqqpus, so raqqpus contains pambpus.\n\nraqqpus is contained in sobmpus and capjpus? \"raqqpus is sobmpus and capjpus\" means raqqpus is contained in sobmpus and capjpus, so sobmpus contains raqqpus.\n\nsobmpus is contained in hovcpus and vujfpus? \"sobmpus is hovcpus and vujfpus\" means sobmpus is contained in hovcpus and vujfpus, so hovcpus contains sobmpus.\n\nhovcpus is contained in hejypus and gonzpus? \"hovcpus is hejypus and gonzpus\" means hovcpus is contained in hejypus and gonzpus, so hejypus contains hovcpus.\n\nhejypus is contained in qelvpus? \"hejypus is qelvpus\" means hejypus is contained in qelvpus, so qelvpus contains hejypus.\n\nqelvpus is contained in vewwpus and gewwpus? \"qelvpus is vewwpus and gewwpus\" means qelvpus is contained in vewwpus and gewwpus, so vewwpus contains qelvpus.\n\nvewwpus is contained in duflpus and peflpus? \"vewwpus is duflpus\" and \"vewwpus is peflpus\" so vewwpus is contained in duflpus and in peflpus.\n\nduflpus is contained in zoxtpus and pantpus? \"duflpus is zoxtpus and pantpus\" means duflpus is contained in zoxtpus and pantpus, so zoxtpus contains duflpus.\n\nzoxtpus is contained in hozppus? \"zoxtpus is hozppus\" means zoxtpus is contained in hozppus, so hozppus contains zoxtpus.\n\nho zppus is contained in zafypus and cowwpus and fusfpus? \"ho zppus is zafypus and cowwpus and fusfpus\" means hozppus is contained in zafypus and cowwpus and fusfpus, so zafypus contains hozppus.\n\nzafypus is contained in poyhpus and zowvpus, and also in kidbpus and poffpus? \"zafypus is poyhpus and zowvpus\" and \"zafypus is kidbpus and poffpus\" so zafypus is contained in poyhpus, zowvpus, kidbpus, poffpus.\n\npoyhpus is contained in xanppus? \"poyhpus is xanppus\" means poyhpus is contained in xanppus, so xanppus contains poyhpus.\n\nxanppus is contained in puhgpus? \"xanppus is puhgpus\" means xanppus is contained in puhgpus, so puhgpus contains xanppus.\n\npuhgpus is contained in yedppus? \"puhgpus is yedppus\" means puhgpus is contained in yedppus, so yedppus contains puhgpus.\n\nyedppus is contained in zesnpus and tumjpus? \"yedppus is zesnpus and tumjpus\" means yedppus is contained in zesnpus and tumjpus, so zesnpus contains yedppus.\n\nzesnpus is contained in nipkpus and harwpus? \"zesnpus is nipkpus and harwpus\" means zesnpus is contained in nipkpus and harwpus, so nipkpus contains zesnpus.\n\nnipkpus is contained in qoxfpus and gidhpus and pixnpus and yesmpus? \"nipkpus is qoxfpus and gidhpus and pixnpus and yesmpus\" means nipkpus is contained in qoxfpus, etc., so qoxfpus contains nipkpus.\n\nqoxfpus is contained in weccpus? \"qoxfpus is weccpus\" means qoxfpus is contained in weccpus, so weccpus contains qoxfpus.\n\nweccpus is contained in maxhpus and ceyfpus? \"weccpus is maxhpus and ceyfpus\" means weccpus is contained in maxhpus and ceyfpus, so maxhpus contains weccpus.\n\nmaxhpus is contained in caltpus? \"maxhpus is caltpus\" means maxhpus is contained in caltpus, so caltpus contains maxhpus.\n\ncaltpus is contained in pincpus and yidxpus? \"caltpus is pincpus and yidxpus\" means caltpus is contained in pincpus and yidxpus, so pincpus contains caltpus.\n\npincpus is contained in vaxnpus? \"pincpus is vaxnpus\" means pincpus is contained in vaxnpus, so vaxnpus contains pincpus.\n\nvaxnpus is contained in fesrpus and rolrpus? \"vaxnpus is fesrpus and rolrpus\" means vaxnpus is contained in fesrpus and rolrpus, so fesrpus contains vaxnpus.\n\nfesrpus is contained in wisfpus? But we have \"vaxnpus is fesrpus\" but also \"fesrpus is wisfpus\"? Not directly. From \"vaxnpus is fesrpus\" but fesrpus is not further defined except that it is contained in vaxnpus? No, \"vaxnpus is fesrpus\" means vaxnpus is contained in fesrpus, so fesrpus contains vaxnpus.\n\nBut we also have \"fesrpus is wisfpus\"? Let's see the given: \"vaxnpus is fesrpus and rolrpus\" so vaxnpus is contained in fesrpus and rolrpus.\n\nThen later, \"fesrpus is wisfpus\" is not stated. Instead, we have \"wisfpus is cisfpus and purtpus\" but that doesn't help.\n\nThis chain seems very long and doesn't lead to yefppus directly. From above, we have zesnpus contained in nipkpus, but nipkpus is contained in qoxfpus, etc., but we need to get to tasmpus or something.\n\nFrom heslpus is tasmpus, and tasmpus is qizjpus, and qizjpus is yefppus.\n\nBut in the chain from vewwpus, we have vewwpus contained in duflpus, then to zoxtpus, to hozppus, to zafypus, to kidbpus, to gatjpus, to ziscpus, to jurdpus, to newppus, to kixspus, to xehhpus, to sephpus, to pattpus, to heslpus, to tasmpus, to qizjpus, to yefppus.\n\nSo yes, from vewwpus, we can reach yefppus.\n\nBut vewwpus contains qelvpus? From earlier, qelvpus is contained in vewwpus, so vewwpus contains qelvpus, which contains hejypus, which contains hovcpus, which contains sobmpus, which contains raqqpus, which contains pambpus, which contains rewgpus, which contains qatkpus, which contains ralhpus, which contains vuvzpus, which contains wosdpus, which contains sozzpus, which contains mehypus, which contains filkpus, which contains kevdpus.\n\nSo, kevdpus is contained in filkpus, which is contained in mehypus, which is contained in sozzpus, which is contained in wosdpus, which is contained in vuvzpus, which is contained in ralhpus, which is contained in qatkpus, which is contained in rewgpus, which is contained in pambpus, which is contained in raqqpus, which is contained in sobmpus, which is contained in hovcpus, which is contained in hejypus, which is contained in qelvpus, which is contained in vewwpus.\n\nBut from vewwpus, we have vewwpus contained in duflpus, etc., but for containment, since vewwpus contains qelvpus, and we have kevdpus contained in vewwpus through the chain, so kevdpus is contained in vewwpus.\n\nThen from vewwpus, through duflpus, zoxtpus, hozppus, zafypus, kidbpus, gatjpus, ziscpus, jurdpus, newppus, kixspus, xehhpus, sephpus, pattpus, heslpus, tasmpus, qizjpus, to yefppus.\n\nSo, since vewwpus is contained in duflpus, and duflpus is contained in zoxtpus, and so on, eventually to yefppus, so vewwpus is contained in yefppus.\n\nTherefore, since kevdpus is contained in vewwpus, and vewwpus is contained in yefppus, so kevdpus is contained in yefppus.\n\nAnd since yefppus is contained in babmpus (from \"yefppus is babmpus\"), so kevdpus is contained in babmpus.\n\nTherefore, x is kevdpus, so x is contained in babmpus, so x is babmpus.\n\nNow, we need to see if x is babbpus.\n\nFrom earlier, we have duxvpus is contained in viycpus, and viycpus is contained in babbpus, so duxvpus is contained in babbpus.\n\nNow, is kevdpus contained in duxvpus?\n\nFrom the chain, we have bugypus contained in duxvpus, and didzpus contained in bugypus, and miyfpus contained in didzpus, and polrpus contained in miyfpus? No, from \"polrpus is miyfpus\" means polrpus is contained in miyfpus, so miyfpus contains polrpus.\n\nBut from \"miyfpus is didzpus\" means miyfpus is contained in didzpus, so didzpus contains miyfpus.\n\nSimilarly, \"didzpus is bugypus\" means didzpus is contained in bugypus, so bugypus contains didzpus.\n\n\"bugypus is duxvpus\" means bugypus is contained in duxvpus, so duxvpus contains bugypus.\n\nSo, from polrpus contained in miyfpus contained in didzpus contained in bugypus contained in duxvpus.\n\nSo polrpus is contained in duxvpus.\n\nBut we need kevdpus to be contained in duxvpus.\n\nIs kevdpus related to polrpus?\n\nFrom kevdpus, we have kevdpus contained in filkpus, which is contained in mehypus, etc., but that chain goes to vewwpus and then to yefppus, not to polrpus.\n\nFrom other side, we have voldpus contained in sagrpus, and sagrpus contained in polrpus, so voldpus contained in polrpus.\n\nBut voldpus is contained in cisfpus? \"cisfpus is voldpus\" means cisfpus is contained in voldpus, so voldpus contains cisfpus.\n\nBut cisfpus is contained in pixdpus? \"cisfpus is pixdpus\" means cisfpus is contained in pixdpus, so pixdpus contains cisfpus.\n\nNot related to kevdpus.\n\nPerhaps from mibtpus? kevdpus is contained in mibtpus, but mibtpus is not defined, so we don't know what mibtpus contains or what contains it.\n\nSo, there is no path from kevdpus to duxvpus that we can find.\n\nTherefore, kevdpus is not contained in duxvpus, and thus not contained in viycpus, and thus not contained in babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is not babbpus.\n\nBut we have shown that x is babmpus.\n\nSo for the question, \"x is babbpus and babmpus?\" we have x is babmpus but not babbpus, so it is false that x is both.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any other path.\n\nNotice that from \"kevdpus is filkpus and mibtpus\" so kevdpus is contained in both, but we used filkpus to get to babmpus, but for babbpus, we need another path.\n\nmibtpus is not used in any chain, so we don't know if mibtpus leads to babbpus.\n\nSimilarly, from duxvpus, we have duxvpus contained in viycpus, but we need kevdpus to be contained in duxvpus, which we don't have.\n\nThus, it is false that x is babbpus.\n\nTherefore, x is babmpus but not babbpus, so the statement \"x is babbpus and babmpus\" is false.\n\nSo the answer should be false.",

Extract statements that can be converted to the form \"A is B\", where B can be a single concept or multiple concepts connected by \"and\" or \"or\"\n2. PRESERVE compound statements: \"A is B and C\" should stay as ONE statement, not split into \"A is B\" and \"A is C\"\n3. Convert equivalent expressions to standard \"A is B\" format:\n   - \"A belongs to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is in B\" → \"A is B\"  \n   - \"A is contained in B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is part of B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is connected to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A is under B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A leads to B\" → \"A is B\"\n   - \"A includes B\" → \"B is A\"\n   - Do NOT use phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\" in output\n4. For explicit chain structures with arrows (→), preserve the chain format without spaces: \"A→B→C→D\"\n5. Remove leading dashes (-) and trailing punctuation (., !, ?) from extracted statements\n6. Distinguish between ACTUAL statements and PLANNING statements:\n   - ACTUAL: Direct factual statements about what IS true (declarative sentences)\n   - PLANNING: Statements about what needs to be determined, found, or checked (including statements from questions, hypothetical scenarios, or uncertainty expressions)\n7. For PLANNING statements, ONLY use these two formats:\n   - \"A is B\" (for goal/connection planning like \"I need to check if A is B\")\n   - \"A\" (for definition lookup like \"I need to find what A is\")\n   - NEVER use other formats like \"A is a category\" or \"A connects to B\"\n8. Do NOT extract self-referential statements like \"A is A\"\n9. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use pronouns (it, this, that) in extracted statements\n10. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use non-standard phrases like \"leads to\", \"includes\", \"under\", \"also under\", \"connects to\" in output\n11. For sentences containing multiple statements with causal relationships, extract them in CAUSAL ORDER: cause first, then effect\n12. If the same statement appears multiple times in the sentence, extract it only once\n13.

IMPORTANT: Statements expressing uncertainty (\"might be\", \"could be\", \"possibly\", etc.) should be classified as PLANNING type\n\n**Examples:**\n- Input: \"- vegwpus is ganfpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"vegwpus is ganfpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is babgpus and rayspus\"} (keep compound statement intact)\n- Input: \"So x belongs to relmpus and muqcpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus and muqcpus\"}\n- Input: \"The chain is: x → A → B → C\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x→A→B→C\"}\n- Input: \"I need to determine if x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"if x is connected to babgpus\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"}\n- Input: \"I need to find what mabtpus is.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"mabtpus\"}\n- Input: \"lerwpus is yexbpus, and yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"lerwpus is yexbpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"yexbpus is lerwpus and pazjpus\"}\n- Input: \"A is B, because A is C and C is B.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is C\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"C is B\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"} (causes first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"x is babgpus, since x is relmpus and relmpus is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"relmpus is babgpus\"}, {\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (premises first, then conclusion)\n- Input: \"babgpus is babgpus\" → Extract: [] (self-referential, ignore)\n- Input: \"But I need to see if x also belongs to these other categories.\" → Extract: [] (general planning, no specific statement)\n- Input: \"The statement means that A belongs to B.\" → Extract: [] (explanatory, not a factual statement)\n- Input: \"But the question is \\\"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus and babkpus and babmpus\"} (question, so planning type)\n- Input: \"Is x babgpus?\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (question format)\n- Input: \"If x is relmpus, then x is babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is relmpus\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (conditional, so planning type)\n- Input: \"x might be babgpus.\" → Extract: {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"x is babgpus\"} (uncertainty, so planning type)\n\n**Input Sentence:**\nSo the answer should be false.\n\n**Output Format:**\nPlease output the extracted statement list in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"statements\": [{\"type\": \"actual\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A is B\"}, {\"type\": \"planning\", \"statement\": \"A\"}, ...]}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Only output the JSON format result, do not add other explanatory text\n- Ensure the JSON format is correct and can be parsed by the program\n- If no qualifying statements are found, output an empty list: {\"statements\": []}\n- Each statement must have both \"type\" and \"statement\" fields",
